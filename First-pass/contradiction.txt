WASHINGTON — It is time that a woman be on American money, the head of the U.S. Treasury Department said.


Former Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, is backing Rachel Carson, whose 1962 book Silent Spring is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement.

## Alexander Hamilton Will Still Be Around


The last changes of portraits on U.S. currency were between 1914 and 1928, when four adjustments were made: Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, replaced Andrew Jackson on the $10 bill; Jackson's image moved to the $20 bill, replacing Grover Cleveland, who now graces the $1,000 bill; and William McKinley replaced John Marshall on the $500 bill.

Lew has said that Hamilton's image will remain part of the new $10 bill. The last woman to appear on American paper money was Martha Washington, the wife of President George Washington. Her picture appeared on a $1 bill in the late 19th century, more than 100 years ago.

COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Gone are the screaming shells, seasick soldiers and bloodied waters of 1944. On Friday, a sun-splattered Normandy celebrated peace, with silent salutes, tears and international friendship marking 70 years since the D-Day invasion helped change the course of World War II and modern history.

COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France — Screaming shells, seasick soldiers and bloodied waters marked Normandy's bloody battle in 1944 during World War II.


Not many of the 150,000 Allied soldiers who slogged onto storm-torn beaches or parachuted into Normandy remain alive to pass on the legacy of that "longest day." Some survivors stood, somber-faced and proud, alongside President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande and other world leaders as they paid tribute Friday to history's biggest amphibious invasion.

On Friday, sunny Normandy celebrated peace, with silent salutes, tears and international friendship. It has been 70 years since the D-Day invasion. The invasion's mighty attack helped change the course of World War II and modern history.


German Chancellor Angela Merkel and a few German veterans also took part in Friday's ceremony, as a gesture of the European unity that the Allied victory brought. Ceremonies large and small were taking place across Normandy and around the world.

The FAA requires that drone and model aircraft operators keep flights to under 400 feet in altitude, keep the aircraft within sight of the operator and stay at least 5 miles away from an airport. Small drones are often indistinguishable from model aircraft, which have grown in sophistication.

The FAA does not allow drones to be used by most businesses. The rules have been ignored. Real estate agents use drones to take overhead pictures of houses for sale. Farmers fly them to check their crops. Rules to let more businesses use drones are being talked about.


— The pilots of a regional airliner flying at about 10,000 feet reported seeing at least one drone pass less than 500 feet above the plane, moving slowly to the south toward Allegheny County Airport near Pittsburgh. The drone was described as black and gray with a thin body, about 5 feet to 6 feet long.

But some observers felt the new measures were tougher than expected. Peter J. Larkin, president and CEO of the National Grocers Association (NGA), said the sweeping new rules were never intended to include grocery stores.

Dawn Sweeney is the head of the National Restaurant Association. She said about 200,000 restaurants nationwide will have to post calorie numbers.


Carla Balakgie, the National Automatic Merchandising Association's (NAMA) president and CEO, said the rules were palatable to the group's 1,500 member companies.

The group is "disappointed" that the FDA's rules includes grocery stories. Larkin said grocery stores will have to spend a lot of money to put up calorie signs. The NGA wants Congress to pass a law to cancel the labeling for grocery stores.

ATLANTA — On the morning of Oct. 14, 1964, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was out of it.

ATLANTA — Fifty years ago, Martin Luther King Jr. won the Nobel Peace Prize.


Today, the prize is in the news for reasons that pain those who celebrated it back then.

## A Party For All People


Rothschild, the influential rabbi of The Temple, which had been bombed six years earlier by white supremacists, was one of several people who decided to act on that notion.

On Dec. 10, King received the prize in Norway. Six days later, the dinner organizers sent a letter to the Coca-Cola Company.


Two years earlier, the Dinkler had refused to honor the reservation of the first African-American Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ralph Bunche.

On the night of Jan. 27, 1965, about 1,500 people, both black and white, packed the Dinkler's ballroom to greet King.

LOS ANGELES — Seventy feet below Wilshire Boulevard, subway construction crews were hard at work. As the jackhammers clattered noisily and an excavator whined, Kim Scott was busy with her own task. As a paleontologist, she studies the history of life on Earth before humans. She was there to search for remains from a long-buried beach. She had plenty of choices.

Not everyone agrees. Tony Dungy, who won a Super Bowl as coach of the Indianapolis Colts, believes there will be little ripple effect from the Hernandez situation and that clubs will continue to do what they have done for decades, rolling the dice on players with character issues if the price is right.

Owners were immediately saying, " 'Let's make sure this doesn't happen to us,'" said former NFL coach Jimmy Johnson. He won two Super Bowls with the Dallas Cowboys. He had some troubled players on his teams. Now he thinks some players who can straighten up will not get the chance. "... people are going to be afraid of getting into a situation like this."


"We need to centralize," Sharpton said, an approach that was contrary to Occupy's determination to avoid getting tied down by specific demands. "The luxury that some have is to just express outrage.

JOHANNESBURG — It was an epidemiologist's worst nightmare: one of the world's deadliest contagious diseases loose in one of the world's most densely populated and sometimes chaotic megacities — Lagos, Nigeria.

JOHANNESBURG — Nigeria has stopped Ebola in what many call an amazing success story.


With its teeming slums, bogus pastors selling miracle cures, six-hour traffic jams and street vendors hawking goods at car windows, some feared an apocalyptic urban outbreak and the spread of Ebola into Nigeria's highly mobile population of more than 170 million, which could entrench the disease in West Africa for years. Thousands have died of the disease since March.

On Monday, the West African country was declared free of the deadly virus by the World Health Organization (WHO). Since July, Nigeria had 19 cases of Ebola, and just seven people died. In other West African countries, about 70 percent of the people who came down with Ebola died. The disease has killed thousands in West Africa.


And just a little bit of luck.

## A Raging Epidemic


In fact, he had visited his sister as she lay dying of Ebola in Liberia and had taken part in her traditional burial.

Sawyer died five days after arriving in Lagos.


On Day 3, when Sawyer's lab results came back positive for Ebola, he decided to leave the hospital. At one point, a doctor forcibly restrained Sawyer as he tried to tear out his intravenous drip in a bid to escape. Sawyer died five days after arriving in Lagos. Dr. Stella Adadevoh, who had restrained him, died the following month.

The doctor, Dr. Morris Ibeawuchi, became ill too. "There was a night I thought my existence on this earth had ended," said Ibeawuchi, who survived.


A pastor claimed on Facebook that he had a "Solution to Ebola!" — laying hands on the sick. Another "solution," circulated by text message, advised people to drink as much salt water as they could. Two people reportedly died from that approach.

## An All-Out Effort ...


They're denied an education, kidnapped, gang-raped and sold in the market. They're forced to cart water and they're married off early to old men.

Malala Yousafzai won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. Malala is the teenage girl who was shot by religious fighters in Pakistan after standing up against laws that stopped girls from getting an education.


In Iraq, the militant group Islamic State (ISIL) has kidnapped hundreds of girls of the minority Yazidi sect in recent months who are raped and sold like cattle or given to commanders as gifts, activists say.

In Nigeria, hundreds of schoolgirls have been kidnapped by the violent group Boko Haram and are still being held.


"This award is for all the children who are voiceless, whose voices need to be heard," Malala, 17, said after she became the youngest recipient in history of a prize that is infrequently awarded to women.

In India, two girls were killed in a village in May. They had gone outside their home at night to relieve themselves in a field because there were no bathrooms inside.


"Twelve-year-old girls, raped. Ten-year-old girls, raped. This girl could be your daughter, she could be your sister, she could be your neighbor," Yazidi lawmaker Vian Dakhil said in a recent interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. "Some are at prisons here, still in Iraq, and some have been taken to Syria, and some are in Mosul. They are taken to be raped, and they are selling them, $150 for a girl."

"I didn't want my future to be just sitting in a room and be imprisoned in my four walls and just cooking and giving birth to children," she said in a BBC interview last year. "I didn't want to see my life in that way."

As if to answer the criticism that he has been too cautious, Obama declared of his plan: "This is American leadership at its best."

## No Permission From Congress


Obama is seeking authorization from Congress for a Pentagon-led effort to train and arm more moderate elements of the Syrian opposition. Even before his remarks, congressional leaders were grappling with whether to support that request and if so, how to get such a measure through the fractured legislature before the November elections.

Obama plans to go ahead with the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. He'll do so without asking Congress. Instead, he will act under authorization Congress passed after 9/11. It gave former president George W. Bush the ability to immediately go after those responsible for 9/11.


The women selected to meet Obama Thursday sat nervously in a formal guest house decorated with elaborate flower arrangements as they waited to discuss ways to promote education with the first lady. She soon put them at ease, bursting out laughing when realizing, after a lengthy introductory spiel, that she'd forgotten to stop and wait for her remarks to be translated.

Obama sat in a circle with the students and Akie Abe. She is the wife of the Japanese prime minister, who heads the Japanese government.

"No support," offered one teenager. "Feeling like you don't belong," said another. "Abuse," said another. "Failure," came a tiny voice from a child who seemed too young to know the feeling, but clearly did.

"How do we make life less to do with pain, and more to do with beauty?" asked Shasta Cano-Martin. She heads the Academy. Two youth coaches led the kids in writing lists of things that built their self-esteem. They also asked the kids to name things that could lead to risky behavior.


But the kids were quick, too, with long lists of things that lead to feelings of self-worth and confidence: Succeeding on tests. Nailing a basket on the court. Hugs. Doing something nice for someone else. Sobriety. Having the urge to try, and succeeding beyond expectations.

Other libraries outside of the National Archive system, like the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, have digitized much of their subject's materials as well — but those digital collections add to an already-impressive physical collection. The Theodore Roosevelt Library and Museum will tentatively open by the end of the decade on a bedrock of a digital collection scholars hope will eventually include every Roosevelt-related item they can find.

"It's very difficult to create a traditional presidential library for TR," said project manager Sharon Kilzer. "All the materials will never be gathered physically in one place."


Stowell estimated that the Roosevelt library will eventually become a "mission control" for scholars and fans of Roosevelt while it slowly collects more physical artifacts in time.

## Abe Lincoln Got Digitalized Too


Richard Woollacott, the project manager for the Ohio-based Hilferty &amp; Associates, which is finishing the master design plan for the library, said he expects Roosevelt's library to look "like the Gilded Age, but updated with computers."

"And I think that's an interesting phenomenon; it's a very 21st-century idea," said Daniel Stowell. He is the director and editor of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. Stowell also is involved with the Roosevelt library.


Chinese tourists spend an average of $2,932 per visit to California, compared with $1,883 for other overseas visitors, according to the latest statistics by the U.S. Office of Travel and Tourism Industries. A big chunk of their spending—about 33 percent — goes for gifts and souvenirs.

This fault has lain dormant since 1717, and it typically produces a major quake every 300 or 400 years. Scientists therefore think the fault is due, estimating a 28 percent chance of a quake in the next 50 years. Beginning in October, experimenters will drill nearly a mile deep into the Alpine Fault.

The scientists are drilling at dangerous faults in New Zealand and Japan. These faults could cause huge earthquakes at any moment.


As co-chief scientist of the Nankai Trough Seismogenic Zone Experiment (NanTroSEIZE) in Japan, Tobin spent seven weeks at sea last winter on a scientific drilling ship called the Chikyu, drilling into the Nankai Fault off the coast of southern Japan.

The New Zealand fault has been quiet since 1717. It causes a major quake every 300 or 400 years. Scientists think the area is due for an earthquake soon. Beginning in October, the geologists will drill nearly a mile deep.


However, scientists encountered many setbacks. Drilling was more expensive than expected, due to rising oil prices. And instruments placed in the borehole failed shortly after they were installed, due to the corrosive gases, crushing pressures and high temperatures they encountered at that depth.

## Pushing And Pulling Air


French singer and accordionist Jessica Fichot — Ms. May in a pinup-style calendar called "Accordion Babes" hanging at Dave's shop — said she noticed the instrument's wave of trendiness eight years ago or so after she graduated from Boston's Berklee College of Music and moved to LA.

Button accordionist Otoño Luján never thought of the instrument as weird or embarrassing.


Among Latino aficionados of the diatonic button accordion — the type mastered by conjunto and norteño greats like Flaco Jiménez and Ramón Ayala and newcomers like La Santa Cecilia — the instrument was not only never a joke but actually quite revered.

Pictures of Weird Al Yankovic and Irish band the Pogues hang on the wall.


Button accordionist Otoño Luján — whose father, Gilbert "Magú" Luján, helped pioneer the Chicano art movement — never thought of the instrument as weird or embarrassing.

Owner Dave Caballero, 68, sat on a piano bench examining the inside of a brown accordion.


Yankovic said he was struck with how mainstream the accordion is in other cultures a few years ago when he watched a Colombian film called "The Wind Journeys", which he described as " '8 Mile,' but with an accordion."

"Accordion is coming back," Gaughenbaugh said, smiling. "For a while it was kind of a joke."


The accordion was a huge part of her life growing up, but Rabe said she almost never talked about it — she knew better. She'd seen the popular bumper sticker proclaiming that anyone who played the instrument should go to jail, and there was the "Far Side" comic that mused that if heaven handed out harps, hell must have accordions.

"We can never catch up," Caballero said. His shop is full of accordions all the time.

In 2005, the NCAA warned schools that they would face sanctions if they didn't change Native American logos or nicknames. Some colleges kept their nicknames by obtaining permission from tribes, including the Florida State Seminoles and the University of Utah Utes.

To combat these effects, we and other researchers have given black students exercises that promote trust in educators or foster feelings of belonging at school. In these exercises, participants read brief testimonies ostensibly written by older students that normalize adversity and reduce the expectation of race-based rejection. For example, students may read testimonies explaining that instructors' critical feedback is motivated by high expectations or that social adversity in college is common and transient, instead of stemming from racial bias. We find that these exercises reduce the academic achievement gap between treated black students and their white peers 40 to 50 percent. Moreover, these effects tend to strengthen over time; three years after the belonging exercise, the grade gap between treated black and white students had closed by 79 percent.

"Essentially what he (the judge) has done is slapped this child on the wrist for what is obviously a very serious offense which he would be responsible for in any other situation," Buffone said. "The defense is laughable, the disposition is horrifying ... not only haven't the parents set any consequences, but it's being reinforced by the judge's actions."

"Affluenza" puts together the words "affluent," meaning rich, and "influenza," or the flu. It was made popular in the late 1990s. The term was usually used to describe children from rich families. These children could do bad things like take drugs or drink alcohol. Then they would use having too much money as an excuse. "Affluenza" is not a real illness.


District Judge Jean Boyd issued his sentence Tuesday after Couch pleaded guilty last week to intoxication manslaughter in the June accident.

Dr. Gary Buffone is a doctor who studies behavior. He is from Florida and he gives advice to rich families. He said the term was never meant to be used in a courtroom.


But prosecutor Richard Alpert argued in court that if the boy continues to be cushioned by his family's wealth, another tragedy is inevitable.

What the judge has done, Buffone said, is slap Ethan on the wrist for a very serious offense. The outcome of the trial is "horrifying," he said.

Today, at 50, Shahgol Shah still obeys mahram, the Afghan custom that forbids women to leave home without a male relative. She wears a burka in public. "That's our tradition," Shah says.

Her 26-year-old daughter, Ghazalan Koofi, lives a life her mother could never have imagined. She leaves home alone every day, working for the government and attending university at night. She speaks fluent English and has never worn a burka. She dresses stylishly but modestly. Her wavy black hair peeks out from under a head scarf.


Koofi came of age after the U.S.-led military invasion toppled the repressive Taliban government in 2001. She has benefited from 12 years of slow, fitful gains for Afghan women. But with U.S. combat troops leaving [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) next year, Koofi and other Afghan women worry that their freedoms will begin to erode.

Koofi was a teenager when the United States invaded [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) in 2011. The U.S. went to war against Afghanistan because the Taliban government gave shelter to Osama Bin Laden. Bin Laden was responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States. The Taliban did not allow women to attend school. They forced women to wear the burka in public and forbade them from going outside their homes without a male relative. Women in Afghanistan gained many freedoms after the Taliban were removed from power.

South Africa maintains that its legal hunting industry adheres to international agreements and actually contributes to the welfare of species, including lion, elephant and rhino.

People against the hunts say the time has come for tourists to stop hunting for sport. Across Africa, big animals like lions, tigers, elephants and rhinos are dying out.


Lions are designated as vulnerable on an international "red list" of species facing threats. By one estimate, fewer than 20,000 lions exist in the wild, a drop of about 40 percent in the past two decades. Another estimate puts the number at closer to 30,000. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has taken note of successful lion conservation in southern Africa, but said West African lions are critically endangered and that rapid population declines were also recorded in East Africa.

## "It Goes On All The Time"


Prince Mupazviriho, permanent secretary in Zimbabwe's ministry of environment, water and climate, said the hunting of a collared lion was an isolated incident.

Michler made a movie about lion hunting, called "Blood Lions." He said that in South Africa, imprisoned lions are raised just to be hunted. Around 1,000 are killed every year by hunters who pay an average of $20,000, and sometimes up to $50,000. The kills are hardly sporting, he said. The lions have nowhere to run and do not stand a chance.


Panthera and the Oxford University-based WildCRU are hosting a Cecil Summit in February in Oxford to draw attention to the threat to lions like Cecil, who conservationists say was lured out of a protected area in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park before being wounded with a bow and arrow and then tracked down and killed.

Henschel lives in West Africa in a country called Gabon. No one had seen a lion in Gabon for 20 years. Recently, a scientist was there filming chimpanzees when a lion crossed in front of her camera.


The findings in Burkina Faso might also have been different had the survey been conducted after last week's military coup, rather than after a popular uprising that last year unseated one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, President Blaise Compaore.

Many of these countries are doing really well, said Staci Warden. She is with the Milken Institute in Santa Monica. It also studies countries around the world. She said that many people are moving from the countryside to the cities. Their governments are making better decisions.


"Everybody who would come to the Soviet Union from America, my father would tell them, 'Please don't forget to bring me some records,'" Tynes-Mensah said. "He loved Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Paul Robeson. But he also loved classical music and opera and ballet."

"My father didn't know anything about this country. He didn't know what to expect," Tynes-Mensah, age 73, said as she sat in her Moscow apartment.


"My father felt the USSR treated him better than America," said Tynes-Mensah, a former university chemistry instructor who was born in the Russian town of Krasnodar and now lives mainly in the United States, spending summers in Russia. "He was happy here."

Tynes was an agricultural expert and had been a football star in college. Nonetheless, back in America he could only find work washing dishes in a restaurant, his daughter recalled. So he jumped at the opportunity to go to Russia.


The experience of African-Americans who traveled to or settled in Russia was overwhelmingly positive, descendants said. In turn, they made valuable contributions to Soviet society, said Blakely, the professor. Agricultural specialists helped devise different uses for materials, such as rope made from hemp. They also helped develop plant species that were cheaper to cultivate. Their contributions provided a boost to the Soviet economy.

Things only got worse after 1947. From 1947 to 1991, the United States and Russia were involved in the Cold War. While there was no military fighting, the two countries became enemies and made threats aimed at each other.


"I had to make a very, very tough choice to go back to school and restart from scratch," said Diallo, 33. "I didn't have a choice. I was going nowhere. By the time I'm going to graduate, I'll be maybe 50."

## Doctors Driving Taxi Cabs


(One exception to this: Refugees, who have a different immigration status from political asylees like Diallo, tend to be less educated, demographers say.)

At home, they were doctors, lawyers or professors. Here, they drive cabs, park cars, work in stores or take care of other people's children. They often are very poor. As a group, though, they are more likely than any other immigrant group to hold at least a university degree, according to the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), which studies immigrants.


"And if you don't come to a job interview and approach it with an American attitude, an American style and an American resume, that credentialing document won't do you much good," Gross said.

"This should be looked at as going across generations," said Tadd Wamester from Upwardly Global, a group that helps immigrants find work. "Investing in parents is also investing in children."


"I've met a lot of girls who prefer some type of hair contraption, rather than their own because they feel hair has to be long to be beautiful," said Simmons. "It doesn't matter if the fake hair is matted and cheap and braids (are) falling off. What does that say about our self-esteem and self-worth?"

## To Love Their Real Hair


"We grew up stretching our curls out and saying, 'See this is how long my hair really is,'" said Jacobs, who's black and wears her hair in a short Afro. "Length is always somewhere in the room unless you take it out the equation and go in the opposite direction, and that's what Lupita and others are doing."

Jana said that many of her customers are done with chemical straighteners and weaves. Their only chance for a healthy head of hair is to cut most of it off.


Encouraging people to embrace short hair has long been a challenge in a media environment overflowing with images of women whose hair is "bouncing and behaving," said Aeleise Jana, 30, a Chicago hair stylist who wears her hair short and specializes in cutting natural hair.

Chicagoan Candace Peterson is the co-founder of the Kiss My Curls blog. In 2011, she cut off most of her own hair. People were not kind.


Miguel Castañeda started Tech Connect in 2009, inspired by a similar program in San Francisco. Castañeda, who grew up in Delano, California, thought students in rural communities should have access to the same opportunities as those in more affluent areas.

## Everyone Goes To College


"It's hard out here," he says of Cutler-Orosi, adding that many people work as farm laborers and there are lots of gangs.

Every student in Tech Connect has gone on to college. This is a great achievement. Over half the adults in their town did not finish high school.


"He's just really good at what he does," says Elizabeth Gonzalez, a grant writer for the program, while watching Castañeda teach students about computer parts last week.

Adylene Saucedo is 15. She says Castañeda is a great leader. "He will do whatever he can to help you out."


Beech Grove's Applied Life Sciences Academy, unveiled in November 2012, is billed as a place of hands-on, frequently technical exploration of live plants and animals. Educators say it makes a connection, helping students who otherwise may grapple with comprehending concepts and theories in a traditional math or science class.

"The only thing I planted was a small garden, and the only thing that grew out of it were weeds," she says.


"It's difficult because my knees are weak and I can't really stand for a long time," he says. "But what can I do? It's even harder in winter, but I can't afford treatment."

## Living Longer But Not Better


However, the report found, wealthy nations are in general better prepared for aging than poorer ones. Sweden, where the pension system is now 100 years old, makes the top of the list because of its social support, education and health coverage, followed by Norway, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. The United States comes in eighth.

"You have to keep working no matter how old you are — no one is rich enough to stop," he says. "Life is very difficult."


It's a typical day in Timothy App's class, which is part of the Veterinary Animal Science and Services magnet program at Colonial High. The four-year program covers critters from the zoo to the wild.

Timothy App teaches Valerie's class. The class is part of a Veterinary Animal Science and Services program. The students learn about all kinds of animals and how to take care of them.


App said he covers all types of animals because that's what his students want to learn. But snakes are clearly an emphasis. The reptiles lurk in the glass tanks that border the room. Students roam freely with the animals wrapped around their necks.

Most of App's students live in homes with small yards and apartments. They do not have room for farm animals. App lets his most serious students keep farm animals near the school. Families have to buy the animals with their own money. 


Because these machines have replaced human labor, said Heraud, some migrant workers will have to find new jobs. That's one of the pitfalls — as more technology is introduced to farming, jobs will be cut. That could deter immigration to places like the Central Valley, which makes much of the nation's food on the backs of migrant workers and has already seen a labor shortage due to U.S. economic problems and the crackdown on undocumented workers.

The task of technology has always been about doing the jobs that humans do, Heraud said. "There will be jobs cost (but) society generally benefits when productivity is increased."

With a thick beard sprouting from a button-down shirt, Kubiak was the teacher who played Steppenwolf songs in class and segued from the textbooks into his personal memories of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War.

Ahmed came to the school in sixth grade. He could hardly speak English. He wore glasses and was small for his age. He was very far from Africa, where he was born. A year later, he could talk about how Judaism, Christianity and Islam are alike.


"He was secure enough in his religion to look at the other side," Kubiak said. The teacher remembered talking about the Islamic State group and other terrorists, agreeing with Ahmed that they twisted Muslim scripture to control ignorant people.

## Intelligent, Creative And Headed For Trouble


Not that the preteen was a full-time philosopher. Another teacher remembered Ahmed after school: He and his friends would line up on opposite ends of a field, careen into each other at full speed, then get up and do it again.

When a video player kept shutting off in class, all the boys looked at Ahmed. He was sitting with a hand-built remote control in his lap.


With Fernandes at the helm, AirAsia took on national carriers such as Malaysia Airlines and grew into a regional juggernaut, with nine affiliates and a fleet of more than 160 Airbus A320 aircraft serving destinations across Asia, according to the company's website. Forbes magazine estimates Fernandes' net worth at $650 million.

At the time, the airline had only two planes. It owed more than $11 million. By agreeing to pay off the airline's debt, they were able to buy the company for just 25 cents.


Fernandes' outsized personality and delight in the limelight also contributed to the airline's success, drawing frequent comparisons to his friend and former employer Richard Branson.

## Cheap Tickets, Funny Ads


But his interests are broad. In 2011, Fernandes bought a majority stake in the Queens Park Rangers, an English Premier League soccer club. He also invested in a Formula One racing team, but later sold the shares. And he has hosted the Asian version of the reality TV show "The Apprentice."

Fernandes began his career working for Branson. Last year, Branson lost a bet to Fernandes over a Formula One car race. Because he lost, Branson had to dress up as a female flight attendant and serve customers on an AirAsia flight.


He defended the airline's safety record at a news conference Tuesday in Surabaya. Dressed in trademark jeans, and rolled-up sleeves, he said it had carried 220 million passengers in 13 years and never had a fatal accident until Flight 8501.

## "I Am Touched"


Streble knows firsthand, having left the Air Force as a pilot in the early 1990s for US Airways. "The military is difficult on the family with all the moving around," he said. "I added more stability by joining the airline."

Dennis Prokopowicz is a pilot with Jet Blue Airways. He says it will be difficult for non-military pilots to achieve that many hours. It is much easier for military pilots to gain that level of experience.


Airports are ecosystems despite all the concrete. They're home not only to planes and trucks but also pigeons, voles, grasshoppers, blackberry shrubs, and even salmon, in the case of Sea-Tac. Managing bird strikes is about creating environments that discourage the hazardous birds, especially ones that flock, like European starlings, or large birds of prey, like red-tailed hawks.

You cannot stop the birds with a fence. So Osmek uses conservation biology. It is a science developed to study and protect the wide range of animals and plants on earth.


Osmek and his team trapped and relocated more than 100 birds in 2011; this year, which has been drier, they've relocated 40 so far. The birds are tagged and taken to northern Washington on Bellair's airport shuttles, and they choose to stay in those skies.

## Songbirds Don't Flock At Airport


Sea-Tac is also the first airport with an avian radar system, started as a pilot program to validate using radar to detect birds. Since it was installed in 2007, the system has been refined. At first, airport duty managers would respond any time a single bird showed up on the radar, but by the time they got to the site in their trucks, the bird would be gone. Now they know to look only for flocks, which are dispersed with fireworks-type "screamers and bangers."

There's no way for an airport to be perfectly friendly to nature. It's the humans who are intruding on wildlife. Instead of fighting nature, humans can play by nature's rules, too. And that's why even airports need wildlife biologists.

He said he had also authorized the use of targeted military strikes if necessary to help the Iraqi security forces protect civilians.

Daniel Radcliffe, who played opposite Rickman in eight "Harry Potter" films, said Rickman was "undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with."

## A Bad Guy Who Was Fun To Watch


Born to a working-class London family in 1946 and trained at the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Rickman was often cast as the bad guy; with his rich, languid voice he could invest evil with wicked, irresistible relish.

In the "Potter" movies, Daniel Radcliffe played the part of teenage wizard Harry Potter. Radcliffe said Rickman was "undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with." The two actors appeared together in eight "Harry Potter" movies. 


Radcliffe, who played Harry, said Rickman "was one of the first of the adults on 'Potter' to treat me like a peer rather than a child. Working with him at such a formative age was incredibly important and I will carry the lessons he taught me for the rest of my life and career."

The EPA is considering using the Clean Water Act to block the Pebble Mine even before it applies for permits.

"It was like a shot to the heart when she said, 'I'm going to make you proud,''' said Robyn Chaney of Dillingham. "It gives you a glimmer of hope."


Added Mary Jane Nielsen, president and CEO of the Alaska Peninsula Corp.: "We just need to be able to have some sort of economy in the villages because we have all these young men falling through the cracks."

"There are no other job opportunities, absolutely none," said Janessa Woods, who has two children. She declared that without Pebble Partnership, she would need government assistance.


Several people in Iliamna urged the EPA not to shut down the mine before the developers submit their plans. They said environmental politics shouldn't trump science.

## "We Are People Of Salmon"


But even in Iliamna, are people are sharply divided.

In Dillingham, everyone who spoke to McCarthy was against the Pebble mine. The town of about 2,300 lives and breathes salmon. Weathered buildings display bright murals. The paintings celebrate salmon and urge the fish's preservation.


"No amount of money or jobs can replace our way of life," Nondalton Tribal Council President William Evanoff told the EPA leader. "The threats are real."

"We are people of fish, we are people of salmon, that is what we depend on," said Tom Tilden. He is the Curyung Tribal Chief. Curyung is the Yupik Indian name for Dillingham.


But it costs up to $100 to purchase a 40-pound case of ground beef, plus 78 cents a pound to fly it from Anchorage, so using ground musk ox or other donated meat instead is expected to add up, officials said.

"The Big Thorne decision is a critical step in the Tongass National Forest's transition to young timber-growth management," Forrest Cole, the forest supervisor, said in 2013 when he announced the Big Thorne Project, the name of the current logging operation on Prince of Wales. "By providing a stable supply of timber to the industry now, we are giving the Forest Service and the industry the breathing space needed to prepare for the transition to young-growth timber."

"We don't need a lot of it," Graham said of the old-growth forest. He is the head of the Alaska Forest Association. He noted that the Forest Service says that most of the old-growth trees have not been cut down. "We just need enough to get us through these next 30 years," he said. "There's plenty of room to have a few sawmills with year-round jobs and still have this last old-growth forest out there untouched."


FORT CHIPEWYAN, Canada — In the Cree language, the word "athabasca" means "a place where grass is everywhere." Here in Alberta, the Athabasca River slices through forests of spruce and birch before spilling into a vast freshwater delta and Lake Athabasca.

FORT CHIPEWYAN, Canada — A hundred miles up the Athabasca River, the forest has been destroyed by mining. Huge shovels pick up 100 tons of earth at a time and dump it into yellow trucks as big as houses.

In 2008, the algae threatened to disrupt Qingdao's hosting of the Olympic sailing competition, so the government dispatched 1,000 soldiers to help purge the waters. These days, municipal authorities are carting off the seaweed to five processing depots, where the water is extracted and the material is dried, then processed into animal feed, fertilizer or a medicinal supplement known as hutai sugar, which is said to help lower blood sugar, according to a report in the Qingdao News.

In general, the plant isn't dangerous. Brave beachgoers have been playing in the green seas. They lay on soft-looking green beds of the material on shore. They are even burying themselves in big green piles of the stuff. Qingdao is living up to its name, which means "Green Island."


Isabel Hutt credits algebra II for dramatically raising her SAT scores, but the 16-year-old admits she wouldn't be in the class if it weren't required. She plans to study Spanish and social work in college.

"Is algebra II required for every job out at our site? The answer is no," Witte said.


Witte said the course is beneficial, but he and Texas lawmakers argued the vigorous math course was pushing some students to drop out.

Washington state recently compared schools with and without higher standards. Graduation rates didn't go down when schools raised their standards, Zinth said.


But the Texas Education Agency reported last summer that an all-time high — nearly 88 percent of students from the Class of 2012 — graduated on time. It was the fifth consecutive year of improvement.

Washington state requires algebra II. Other states that require it include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Utah.

As proof that the market for alpacas hasn't tanked, Sturgeon says, his farm has a male, Crescent Moon's Kryptonite, that he says is worth $350,000 because he breeds for high-quality offspring. Sturgeon's website says that price was set in 2006.

"It was our life's savings," Silver says.


Silver says he and his wife got into the alpaca business after she went to a livestock show and became enamored with them.

It's a story that remained untold for decades and one that his son, the Rev. Chris Edmonds, only discovered long after his father's death in 1985.

"Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier," said Avner Shalev. He is the head of Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial in Israel. During World War II, the Germans tried to destroy the Jewish people. At the time, Germany was run by the Nazis. Nazi Germans killed and imprisoned millions of Jews during the Holocaust. Edmonds "had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings," Shalev said. "The choices and actions of Master Sergeant Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers."


Witnesses to the exchange said the German officer then withdrew. Stern, who currently lives in Reston, Virginia, told Yad Vashem that even 70 years later he can "still hear the words."

Then the Nazi officer pointed his pistol at Edmonds and offered him one last chance.


About 6 million European Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators during World War II. The names of those honored for risking their lives to protect Jews are engraved along an avenue of trees at the Jerusalem memorial.

Edmonds told him: "If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us," Chris Edmonds said.


More than 26,000 have been designated "Righteous Among the Nations," the most famous being Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film "Schindler's List," and Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who is credited for having saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.

The German officer gave up. Chris Edmonds said he thinks his father saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.

"Amphibians are a good indicator of what's going on," said Joel Snodgrass, a professor and chairman of biology at Towson University.

## Mosquito Eaters


The researchers limited their monitoring to sites controlled by the U.S. Department of the Interior, so development likely had little direct impact on the amphibians' habitat. "The fact we see declines even in protected areas means there is some larger-scale issue going on with amphibian populations," Grant said.

The study did not try to give a reason for the decline.  Disease, chemicals, climate change and even a new species being added to a habitat have been blamed in the past. The researchers monitored nature sites controlled by the government. So new buildings going up was not a big factor.


In Maryland, state biologists say that with a few exceptions they have not seen drastic declines in the past 20 years or so in the 20 species of frogs and toads, or in the 21 species of salamanders and newts found in the state. Glenn Therres, a wildlife biologist with the Department of Natural Resources who oversees an annual volunteer-driven census of the state's amphibians and reptiles, noted that there has not been any systematic sampling done for most of the state's species, so it's hard to draw overarching conclusions.

## Frogs, Hold The Salt


Among those riders listed in the records is Adrienne Sacks of Rockville, Md., who grew ill after riding Disneyland's Space Mountain in the summer of 2012.

—Three men died after the rides. Two of them had serious medical conditions before going on the rides. That likely caused their deaths. The cause of the third man was unknown.


Parks are not required to report data on attendance or the number of riders per attraction. That makes it impossible to calculate an injury rate based on ridership.

## Injury Reports Required


By comparison, the odds of being hurt in a bathroom accident, leading to a hospital visit, are about 1 in 1,037 in a given year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Disney officials also attributed the injury figures at Space Mountain to park visitors' wide-ranging demographics, including older people and people with health problems.

The shoebox-size chunk of bronze didn't attract much attention when divers retrieved it from an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1901. Archaeologists on the expedition had their hands full with far more impressive finds, including life-size statues of warriors and horses, delicate glass bowls and scores of ceramic vessels called amphorae.

A shoebox-size chunk of bronze called the Antikythera Mechanism has scientists and people who study math excited.


The real breakthrough in understanding came in 2005, when a team of scientists used X-ray tomography to peer through the encrusted metal and reveal the layers of gears inside. Digital techniques yielded the first sharp images of the inscriptions on the dials and casings.

Greek sponge divers stumbled across the wreck of the Roman ship in 1900. Divers dug up items from the wreck the next year.


But the famous inventor died seven years before 205 B.C., and there's no way to link him to the Antikythera Mechanism.

The 205 B.C. date is important. It means the device was built around the lifetime of Archimedes. He was the Greek genius who revolutionized geometry and invented compound pulleys. Archimedes was killed in 212 B.C. during the Roman conquest of the Greek city state of Syracuse in Sicily.


In 1969, she emerged as an author. Her first book, "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings," was a critical and commercial success. In it, she described being raped at age 7 by her mother's boyfriend.

She was a poet, dancer, actress, songwriter, civil rights activist, streetcar conductor, Creole cook, cocktail waitress, filmmaker and script writer. She toured Europe and Africa in the 1950s as an entertainer. It was then that she started using the name Maya Angelou.


"I'm very fortunate, here in my town," she said, referring to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, "to have a hotel which I use. And everyone there, from the clerks, the counter people, the reservations people, the maids and the janitors and so forth, everyone says they don't know me.

For six years after the rape, Angelou said, she rarely spoke. When she did it was only to her brother. That experience led to her becoming a writer.

Burley posited that organizing large groups of light rays into bundles would allow a computer system to more efficiently handle calculations of their trajectories. By doing this, a film could feature more lighting sources and add nuance to their depiction. He presented his theory to Disney Animation executives in November 2011, and they were encouraged.

Light can split into "thousands of rays," Hendrickson said. "Does it reflect right back if it came off a mirror? Does it scatter? Does it pick up the color of the object? You end up running out of computing power."

Rival Lockheed Martin Corp. — the primary subcontractor to Boeing Co. — said it also planned to work on the new warplane in Palmdale, Ledford said. That plan could mean adding 700 jobs, he said.

According to Ledford, Northrop said it would build most of the bomber parts in Palmdale. It would create about 1,500 jobs.


Air Force officials have said the warplane would eventually be outfitted to carry nuclear weapons. They also want it to one day be capable of flying as a drone.

## Hiding From The Enemy


Other details are a closely guarded secret.

The Air Force will make the final decision over building the plane. Air Force officials say they need the bomber. It would fly so secretly that it could avoid the most advanced enemy radar. The warplane would eventually be able to carry nuclear weapons. Officials said they want to fly it with remote controls as a drone.


As for the music, historians say Key had in mind a specific popular tune, "To Anacreon in Heaven," which has been widely described as a drinking song. Library of Congress music specialist Loras John Schissel explained in an interview that the tune, honoring Greek poet Anacreon, became a drinking song for the gentlemen's club called the Anacreontic Society, but a more high-minded one than the term suggests.

"People sing the song all the time, but don't know anything about it," said Jennifer Jones, an expert at the museum. "These words that we sing were inspired by this flag. Having them in the same place at the same time is exciting."


"We hope as a national museum, people will be inspired to learn more about history and to be part of history," Jones said.

As a result, the study authors argue, Earth has entered a new epoch that is "functionally and stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene," in the words of the paper laying out the case. Humanity has even reconfigured the course of future evolution by shifting plants and animals around the globe or eliminating certain species—the same biological markers known as index fossils and used to define most of the time intervals that divide the last 540 million years, an eon known as the Phanerozoic. Key questions remain, however, such as when specifically this new epoch began—whether it is old and pegged to the advent of farming or widespread burning of landscapes by ancient ancestors or is very new. In fact, some, including Zalasiewicz, have proposed a very precise start date for the Anthropocene: July 16, 1945, the date of the first test of an atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, and the beginning of the spread of rare radioactive elements like plutonium around the globe. The roots of the Anthropocene may reach back into the Pleistocene but the most evident signs point to a new epoch that began around 1950 when human population and many other signals like bomb testing really took off, leaving manufactured radionuclides that will be detectable for at least 100,000 years.

We are currently in the Holocene epoch. It began about 11,750 years ago when an ice age ended. This brought about a series of geologic changes that shaped the Earth as we know it.

The big red apples, tough of skin and mealy in texture, dominated the marketplace during his childhood and convinced him he didn't care for apples. He remembers opening his metal lunchbox to "the overpowering smell of an overripe Red Delicious." He couldn't trade it away. "It was the lowest thing on the scale. And the lowest thing on Halloween was getting an apple, a Red Delicious."

Although Apple remains the single largest manufacturer of smartphones, more U.S. consumers now own Android devices running Google's software, according to researcher the Yankee Group. As consumers gravitate to Google-powered smartphones, they lose access to the world's biggest and most widely recognized music retailer, Apple's iTunes.

Smartphones have become the new Sony Walkman. The Sony Walkman is a portable music player. It came out in the U.S. in 1980, and became the first device that let people listen to music anywhere they went. About half of smartphone owners use their phone every day to stream music. Just four out of 10 people use them for downloading music, says Nielsen SoundScan. Nielsen tracks the sales of music in the U.S.


Though few artists enjoy the popularity of Beyonce, Apple uses the example to buttress its argument that withholding albums from streaming services can spur sales.

The case is just one example in a recent spate of animals turning up in places they don't belong - generally, either Pacific species showing up in the Atlantic, or vice versa. Northern gannets, a North Atlantic species, have been spotted off the coast of California several times in recent years, for instance, while several Pacific species of auks, a type of diving bird, have recently been observed in the Atlantic.

Gray whales live in the Pacific Ocean. In the spring of 2010, though, a single gray whale was spotted in the Mediterranean Sea. It was the first time a gray whale was seen in the North Atlantic in about 200 years. 


It's a perplexing - yet apparently increasing - trend. And while animals do occasionally wander outside of their ranges, scientists are starting to believe that the recent flurry of movements between the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins are early evidence of yet another consequence of climate change. They're arguing that as sea ice continues to melt in the Arctic, passageways are opening for certain animals - heretofore restricted by the ice - to start moving through, enabling them to cross into new territories.

## How Did YOU Get HERE?


But as passageways open up in the melting ice, these animals become more free to move about as they please. Such exchange could cause a variety of ecosystem-level changes down the road, the authors of the new paper argue, such as the potential for dramatic changes to food webs.

Between the Atlantic and Pacific are giant continents. Sea creatures cannot cross them. Connecting the two oceans to the north is the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic is one of the coldest places on earth. Because of how cold it is, big parts of the Arctic Ocean are covered in ice. 


The paper bases its argument on the growing list of recent examples - the gray whales, the gannets and the auks, as well as unusual sightings of other birds and mammals, such as bowhead whales and shearwaters.

## Melting Ice Makes Travel Easier


"Animals on occasion get lost and they show up in strange places - 'birds have wings' is the saying," said the paper's lead author, the aptly named Seabird McKeon, a research scientist with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. "There are some species that are more prone to vagrancy than others, and so we do have this backdrop of motion."

The ice usually keeps animals from using the Arctic to move between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Animals like whales and seals have difficulty getting through the ice. It gets in the way of their swimming and can block them from coming up to breathe. Birds can fly over the frozen ocean, but the ice prevents them from diving for fish.


One example the authors point to is the Great American Biotic Interchange, which occurred several million years ago when the isthmus of Panama formed, allowing land animals a bridge to cross between North and South America. As the authors note, the fossil record indicates that in this case, mammals from North America invaded South America and outcompeted many of the native species there for resources. This type of outcome is a potential concern with species crossing from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and vice versa.

## Watch Out For Killer Whales!


These craters will then become lakes, which further thaw the permafrost around and beneath them as the water traps yet more heat from the sun. Similar new lakes are forming in depressions in the newly thawing lumpy landscape across the Arctic known as thermokarst. Such thermokarst lakes and surrounding marshes create the muddy conditions favoring microbes that break dead plant material down into methane. That methane then bubbles out of the lakes and ground and, where concentrated, can even be lit on fire, leading to cases of flames dancing above the ice.

Nothing in science can "really, fully explain those craters," said geologist Guido Grosse, who is traveling to Siberia in northern Russia this year.


Even more widespread than blast craters or burning ice are drunken trees. When permafrost thaws, soil that was once as solid as concrete becomes mud, due to the fact that ice makes up as much as 80 percent of the ground in some parts of the Arctic. And because ice takes up more space than water, the ground subsides, causing trees that grew upright to lean as the ground liquefies beneath them. Whole forests have listed like an army of drunkards as a result. This is also bad news for modern infrastructure in the Arctic as well: Roads, pipelines and building foundations sink into mud and crack or entire landscapes subside. "Long term, there are huge economic and social impacts to permafrost degrading," Schaefer notes.

## What Made The Craters?


There are attempts to expand the monitoring of the Arctic, but huge gaps persist because of its vast extent and harsh conditions. As in most sciences, observations to date are limited to where it is easy for scientists to get to, rather than where one would place monitoring to ensure maximum coverage. Of emerging research questions surrounding the Arctic in the Anthropocene — a putative new geologic epoch tied to relatively recent human impacts on the planet of planetary scope — the fate of the permafrost looms large as a known unknown, as the National Academy of Sciences acknowledged in a report this past April.

Whole forests are now leaning to one side, earning the nickname "drunken trees."

Sheriff Arpaio has said that he supports the NRA's plan for an armed officer in every school. He also says that his plan differs from the NRA's proposal. Its focus is on enhancing security in the area surrounding schools, not directly inside them.

The phenomenon is fueling a debate about just how much Asia is to blame for bad air in the U.S, one that could soon have health consequences for people across the West.

The rise in ozone levels was not supposed to happen. Across the country, pollution from cars, trucks and factories has been cut a lot.


Limiting pollution flowing in from Asia would require an international treaty, said Owen Cooper, an atmospheric scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences in Boulder, Colorado.

Dolores Weller is director of the Central Valley Air Quality Coalition. She says that state and local officials are looking for "further excuses." Weller believes officials do have the power to control pollution that is created at home.

Because of its crucial role in the creation of Israel, the Holocaust is freighted with political overtones in Palestinian society, where many think that their people have paid the price for the persecution of the Jews in Europe.

## Repairs: Dotting Every i


The 2010 bomber fire started after some of that material broke down, soaked up oil and ignited when one of the B-2's four engines fired up, according to Air Force investigation documents that were released after a request from the Los Angeles Times.

All that attention to detail paid off. The plane, named Spirit of Washington, started right up on the first attempt.


A few weeks after the fire, Byrne's boss called a meeting around a toolbox in Palmdale to brief the crew on the accident. Byrne, 29, was told he'd be part of the first group going to Guam.

Back in the U.S., Byrne noticed a black dot flying just above the San Gabriel Mountains early one morning.


"I was amped to go," he said. "I had no idea where Guam was. I had to look it up on a map and saw this tiny dot in the middle of the Pacific."

He knew what it was. So did the other workers surrounding him. They were waiting on this windy runway at the company's plant in Palmdale to see the aircraft nicknamed "Lazarus" — the plane that died in a fire on the island of Guam only to be brought back to life. (Lazarus is a character in the Bible who dies and is brought back to life by Jesus.)


But then the workers popped open the plane's 100-plus access panels. "The extent of the damage was surprising," said David G. Mazur, Northrop's vice president of long-range strike operations. "It took my breath away. Hundreds of parts would have to be replaced."

"After all that time, it finally made it back home," Byrne said. "In some ways, we couldn't believe we pulled it off."

Only 2 percent of the parents surveyed said they had waited until their children were 4 to introduce them to the wonders of the touch-screen.

He was born in Lucenec, Czechoslovakia, in 1925 and grew up as Europe edged toward its second continental war of the century.

"When I was 14, I was always licking this and licking that, and mother would say, 'Are you eating again? I'm going to send you to baker's school.'"

Feld was just 17 years old. He was sent by train to Hungary where he began work as a cook at a farm camp. Then a Nazi leader, who was looking for someone to cook for German officers at an airport the Nazis were building, heard he was a baker.


In 1942, three years after the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Feld was just 17 as Jews were rounded up. As he stood on the train platform, waiting to board with other men bound for a work camp, his mother saw him off: "She was worried that I had nice strong shoes."

BALTIMORE — The umpire walked on the field with a gracious wave to the crowd. He might have been joking, or just stuck in his habits. There was no crowd.

BALTIMORE, Md. — These are the sounds of baseball: the crack of a wooden bat hitting a ball; the pop of a ball hitting a glove; the organ; the cheering fans.


It wasn't being played so much for the love of the game as the obligation to the standings and the unforgiving 162-game schedule.

On Thursday, no one enjoyed the beautiful weather. No one snacked on Maryland crab cakes or booed the umpire.


"If a ball goes into the seats and nobody sees it, is it still a home run? You bet it is," said Cooper, a 38-year veteran of the game, who sat in the dugout before the game chewing tobacco.

Adam LaRoche is the first baseman for the White Sox. He said having no fans had taken away some of the meaning of the game.


The rumbles from the players' dugout — "Go, go!" "Come on, baby!" — could be heard from the press box, as could the scraping swoosh of players sliding into base.

Outside the stadium's gates, a small group of fans peered in. They provided the games only cheers: "O-R-I-O-L-E-S … Let's go, O's!"


"Goodbye," said the television play-by-play announcer, celebrating an unusually long home run, his voice carrying farther outside the broadcast booth than normal.

As for the decision to hold a game in an empty stadium, he said it was an overreaction.

"You're taking away from the fans, but I understand there is bigger stuff going on than baseball right now," said Benjamin Fluke, age 19. He was watching the game from outside.


As a brilliantly sunny morning dawned over neighborhoods left in tatters, city workers and citizens began slowly cleaning up the debris — hauling away charred remains of vehicles, sweeping up shattered glass and continuing to put out a massive structure fire that burned through the night in the city's worst episode of racial violence since 1968.

Rioting began out on the city's west side Monday afternoon after the funeral of Freddie Gray. His spine was severely injured on April 12 after he was arrested. Gray died a week later.


"This is not protesting. This is not your First Amendment rights," he said. He praised one woman who was filmed smacking her teenage son on the head and pulling off his hood. "I wish we had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight."

Batts said he was upset by scenes of Baltimore's teenagers looting and burning.


Gov. Hogan said he waited until he received a request from the city before deploying the National Guard.

Batts praised one woman who was filmed hitting her teenage son on the head for rioting. "I wish we had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight."


For the past several decades, scientists thought that the slugs hoarded chloroplasts in order to become solar-powered animal-plant hybrids. It made a lot of sense. Experiments confirmed that, when placed in the light, the slugs actively absorbed carbon dioxide, just like leaves. And some of the slugs could stay alive in a well-lit laboratory for months with no food. Besides, why else would the animals go to the trouble of preserving the chloroplasts, if not as a long-term energy source?

Algae have no stems, roots or leaves. However, they do contain green-colored chlorophyll, which plants use for photosynthesis.


Equally mysterious to the benefit of storing chloroplasts is how the slugs delay digestion in the first place. Do their digestive enzymes identify and ignore chloroplasts, but break down all the other part of the algae? Or do the slugs have a kind of gut sanctuary that is physically separated from the rest of the digestive tract? Both Gould's experiment and earlier studies have affirmed yet another mystery: in the slugs' guts, the chloroplasts keep photosynthesizing—something that should not be possible.

Most slugs that eat algae quickly eat up the chloroplasts as well. Their bodies break down the chloroplasts right away, turning them into food.


Ongoing research in Rumpho's lab further calls into question who really has the power in this hostage situation. E. chlorotica, the shimmering emerald slug species that Rumpho studies, seems to be so dependent on algae for survival that if baby slugs are not exposed to algae for at least seven days, they stop growing and die. It's almost as if these sea slugs have evolved to self-destruct if there is no algae around in their youth, because without the plants and their chloroplasts they simply would not make it. Rather than producing sugars, the chloroplasts E. chlorotica captures from its algae primarily make lipids, which provide a source of energy as well as building materials for cells. A young slug needs a lot of lipids to grow rapidly. What if this one sacoglossan has outsourced its lipid production to chloroplasts? If so, captive chloroplasts would be so much more than a postponed meal for the slugs—they would be more like a continually renewed vital organ.
Scientist Sven Gould ran an experiment using six sacoglossans. None of the slugs were given any food at all for 55 days.

"It's fantastic that they have this common industry that has put women to work," said Charles Kernaghan, director of the Institute for Global Labor and Human Rights, based in Pittsburgh. Recent street protests in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, by garment workers helped nudge the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) to $68 a month, which he said equates to 33 cents an hour. The industry, Kernaghan said, must do more to provide a decent living wage and respect workers' rights.

The book's writer, Susan Marenco, has since blamed Barbie's corporate parent, Mattel, telling Kids Tech News this week: "(Mattel) can't get out of that groove of 'she's nice, she doesn't show anger, she doesn't show frustration.'" She told ABC News, "Maybe I should have pushed back, and usually I do, but I didn't this time."

"I'm only creating the design idea," Barbie says. "I'll need Steven and Brian's help to turn it into a real game."


It went viral: Fiesler said her website had about 800 all-time visits before the project, and has nearly 50,000 now. She said she has received a request to translate it into French.

## An Apology From Barbie's Maker


The reaction surprised and delighted her. "If I'd known it was going to blow up like this, I would have proofread it a little more," Fiesler said, adding that the response has been almost wholly positive.

Susan Marenco wrote the original book, where Barbie is not very good with computers. She blamed Mattel, the company that makes the Barbie doll, for the book's message.


In addition to her Ph.D. work on the intersection in digital spaces of copyright law and technology, Fiesler said she has a law degree from Vanderbilt. She also is a writer.

Marenco said the company still thinks that Barbie is "nice, she doesn't show anger, she doesn't show frustration."

Rob Rains, the author of "James Naismith: The Man Who Invented Basketball," co-written with Naismith's granddaughter Hellen Carpenter, said he didn't know any other audio recording of Naismith. He said the recording suggests that the game "was modified much more quickly than we first thought."

## A Perfect Mix


Despite the dismal prospects for little brown bats, researchers have grasped at a few hopeful signs. Some little brown bats that have been banded for research are returning to hibernate each year in the same caves and abandoned mine shafts, such as Hibernia Mine in Rockaway Township, showing that at least this small group has managed to fight off the disease, either by building up immunity or because they possess a gene that aids resistance to the fungus.

## Hibernation Becomes Deadly


The loss of bats can affect humans, since bats eat vast quantities of insects that damage crops or carry West Nile virus and other diseases. The suppression of insects is worth more than $4 billion annually to U.S. agriculture.

"We think we've got a great case to make," the Humane Society's chief executive, Wayne Pacelle, said in a heated televised debate Oct. 14. "The fact is, you don't need to use these methods to hunt the animals. Hunting is supposed to give the animals a chance, and this stacks the deck so badly."

## Bear Claws Come Out


Opponents led by a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt say the Humane Society's involvement shows that this is a fight being bankrolled by outside lobby groups with a broader agenda of ending sport hunting nationwide. Save Maine's Bear Hunt supporters include the state's Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, which estimates Maine has more than 30,000 black bears.

The Humane Society supports Mainers for Fair Bear Hunting. It is the group leading the fight to change Maine's hunting rules.


"We have one of the largest bear populations in the country, certainly on the East Coast," said James Cody, the campaign manager for Save Maine's Bear Hunt. Cody said 93 percent of the kills in last year's bear hunt involved one of the three methods that could be banned.

On the other side of the battle is a group called Save Maine's Bear Hunt. They say the Humane Society's involvement shows that this is a fight being paid for by outside groups. They suspect it is part of a larger goal of ending hunting for sport across the nation. Save Maine's Bear Hunt supporters include Maine's wildlife department. It estimates that Maine has more than 30,000 black bears.


The use of bait, in which hunters put out buckets filled with junk food and sweets such as donuts and syrup, was cited in 72 percent of kills, according to state wildlife officials.

"We have one of the largest bear populations in the country, certainly on the East Coast," said James Cody of Save Maine's Bear Hunt. Cody said 93 percent of the kills in last year's bear hunt involved one of the three methods that could be banned.

They apparently had been raiding a neighbor's trash. Her garbage was tucked in the garage. It was near midnight. Even so, Savino let off four blasts from an air horn that a state biologist had recommended she carry to scare off nosy bears.

Bateman, 56, said, "I want them to take it more seriously."


Bateman loved telling friends the story about the bear that ate her children's stocking stuffers — chocolate Santas — one Christmas Eve when she accidentally left her van door open.

"This state has lost more of its wetlands than all other states, and beavers can rebuild those wetlands," said Rick Lanman of the Institute for Historical Ecology in Los Altos. "Knowing that it is native should help guide restoration efforts."

Because beavers are so good at recharging ground water, they can make streams flow when they would otherwise run dry such as during the summer months.

Beaver dams help nature in ways that humans cannot easily copy. They change land so that it soaks up water. It is almost like a sponge. This helps makes better soil so more plants can grow. The dams slow down the flow of water.


The animals receive individual attention from veterinarians and nutritionists and are protected from predators, spokesman Daren Williams said.

"We're working with the Ministry of Education and experts from Tsinghua University on what kinds of air purifiers are fit for schools, and we'll come up with a citywide plan for air purification in schools," she said. "This is not just a job for the Ministry of Education; it also involves the State Administration of Work Safety and the Ministry of Environmental Protection."

One school leader in Beijing spoke about the problem. She said schools are not encouraged to accept air purifiers from parents. Instead, schools are encouraged to close when pollution is bad.


A red alert requires a forecast of 72 consecutive hours of pollution levels of 300 or higher on the city's air quality index. The index is closely linked to levels of PM2.5, although it also includes other pollutants. As an example, one Beijing monitoring site at midday showed an index reading of 308 and a PM2.5 reading of 258.

Moran and other USGS analysts confirmed last month that St. Helens remains active. While an eruption is not impending, the analysis showed a new supply of magma is slowly repressurizing the magma chamber beneath the mountain.

Steve Malone, now a professor at the University of Washington, helped predict the St. Helens eruption 34 years ago. He is involved in the iMush studies.


Obtaining the necessary permits to install instruments has been a logistical challenge, Malone said, because of multiple landowners, including state and federal government agencies, Weyerhaeuser and other timber companies and private landowners. All have their own legal requirements and concerns.

"You can put 15 of them in a backpack," he said.


The thousands of smaller seismometers that will be used in the explosive testing are easily portable, Moran said. They're slightly smaller than a can of tennis balls, and run off two D-cell batteries.

Today, Ossies, as residents in the former East are called, suffer from higher unemployment and are paid less than their countrymen in the former West. Those who've retired find their pensions are significantly lower. Ossies also have far less in savings and assets.

In many ways, life is better today for Ossies, the name given to former residents of East Germany. They have free speech and elections. They can travel and they are free from government spying.


Kleinmachnow Syndrome is the result of a simple ideological difference between capitalism and socialism: property ownership. In the West, it was sacrosanct. The East didn't believe in it. As a result, when the country became one again, many East Germans lost the homes they'd lived in, many for decades, to West Germans, who had fled or abandoned them, depending on your perspective, but were able to reclaim them when Germany was unified.

## "I Planted Trees"


As a schoolboy, Warnick remembers, he was puzzled each autumn upon returning to school to learn that several classmates had moved away.

"I planted trees, so that my grandchildren's grandchildren would know their grandfather's grandfather had put down these roots," he said.


The East German government didn't have the money to maintain the mass of homes it then had title to, so it started assigning houses to those who stayed in the East. With a housing shortage, it urged people to build homes on garden plots when possible. While it didn't allow property ownership, the government offered 99-year leases.

Roughly 400,000 Cuban-American passengers went to Cuba last year, taking advantage of a 2009 rule change by President Barack Obama that allows unlimited visits to family members.

## Restrictions On Travel To Cuba


Another rule change in 2011 allows groups licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department to lead cultural tours of Cuba. The idea was to put more Americans in contact with the Cuban people. Some proponents hoped this closer engagement would build pressure for economic and political reforms in the island nation.

The U.S. and Cuba have been at odds for more than 60 years. The U.S. made a rule that no American can do business with Cuba. Americans are allowed to travel to Cuba. But the rules don't make it easy. Going without the proper permission can run the risk of a huge fine. The rules are less strict for Cuban-Americans.


Rubio and other embargo defenders — who want to sharply limit even family visits — say all these trips put money in the hands of a repressive Castro regime.

Locals can check out tablets or e-readers for free. Or they can use the library's 48 iMac desktop computers. Children can take home any of the 200 Nook readers pre-loaded with 150 books aimed at their age group.

No computer? No problem.


At North Carolina State University's new James B. Hunt Jr. Library in Raleigh, the 1.5 million books are stored underground, leaving lots of space for research and study groups. Virtual stacks enable students to check out books from a unique robotic retrieval system known as a bookBot that delivers them in five minutes or less.

At the MLK library, there's a giant touch screen for teaching classes and a 3-D printer. A 3-D printer creates three-dimensional objects. The library also has a sound studio, a machine that will print and bind a book, and work areas. In the children's section, kids can read and play on a touch-screen table.


That kind of conversion may be spreading. The BiblioTech attracts a steady flow of foreign and national visitors. Several San Antonio library officials are traveling to the Netherlands and England in a few weeks at the invitation of foreign officials to make presentations about their operation.

The awkward kickoff for a series of official meetings in Beijing followed Biden's speech earlier Wednesday urging young Chinese citizens to challenge orthodoxy and the status quo. The vice president drew an implicit contrast between the authoritarian rule of China's government and the liberal, permissive intellectual culture he described in the United States.

On Wednesday, China said the United States was taking Japan's side. The United States refuses to accept China's rules about flying in the zone.


"Candor generates trust," Biden said. "Trust is the basis on which real change — constructive change — is made."

Neither Biden nor Xi mentioned the clash over disputed territory publicly. That fight has pitted China against the United States and its friends in Asia.


"This action has raised regional tensions and increased the risk of accidents and miscalculation," Biden said in Tokyo Tuesday after meeting with Japanese President Shinzo Abe.

Biden said he came to Beijing because involved relationships require continuing contact between top officials. He said Xi was open and constructive.


Recovery efforts date back to the 1970s when the bighorn population declined to one area — Wheeler Ridge on the northern edge of Kings Canyon. The herd became the source population for recovery efforts in the 1970s and 1980s that introduced sheep to Mono Basin east of Yosemite and Mount Baxter and Mount Williamson east of Kings Canyon and Sequoia.

Before Vawter could strap on the bionic lower limb, engineers in Chicago had to "teach" the prosthetic how to read his motor intentions from tiny muscle contractions in his right thigh.

"With this leg, it just flows," said the 32-year-old software engineer. "There isn't anything special I have to do to make it work right." Vawter lives in Washington. Most of the time he uses a typical prosthetic. But he travels to Chicago several times a year to work with the robotic leg.

In one stretch over 15 hours, the geese went up and down, over and over. But they only climbed 1 mile over the mountains.

Everyone was in agreement that the jets would contain electrons, which have a negative charge. But the jets did not have a negative charge overall. That suggested there was something else in there with a positive charge that canceled it out.

## Positrons Or Normal Matter?


"Until now, it wasn't clear whether the positive charge came from positrons, the antimatter 'opposite' of electrons, or positively charged atoms," study coauthor James Miller-Jones of the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research said in a statement. "Since our results found nickel and iron in these jets, we now know that ordinary matter must be providing the positive charge."

"It was one of the unsolved questions about relativistic jets produced in the vicinity of black holes," said astronomer Avi Loeb. The question is what are the jets made of, he said.


"The jets are not always on," Miller-Jones told the Los Angeles Times. "It depends a little bit on how fast the black hole is feeding."

The researchers' discovery of nickel and iron in the jets seems to have settled that question. "We now know that ordinary matter must be providing the positive charge," Miller-Jones said.

Martin calls the trend a "sad event."


The stigma of doing something besides being with family on Thanksgiving has been dissipating, and shopping is only the latest alternative activity, said Randy Allen, a management professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

David Gladney said he prefers early Thanksgiving Day store openings. That way he can get his deal hunting out of the way in the beginning of the day and get back to food, family and football.


Other events such as Turkey Trot running races and deer hunting on Thanksgiving morning pull people away from family, Allen said. And, of course, sports fans are often loafing in front of televised football games. What's the harm in non-sports fans participating in the most American of all sports, competitive shopping?

"I would come out — just because it's that early," he said.


The gap between whites and blacks has been fueled by many factors. Black college graduates don't have strong networks, and they often don't have the experience to navigate the corporate world and reach the people who hire.

There's also a 21-foot concrete guard tower from Angola prison, the Louisiana State Penitentiary, that was built in the 1930s and to Bunch serves as a powerful symbol of the oppression of African-Americans.

## A Tower, A Cabin


A slave cabin from Point of Pines Plantation on Edisto Island, S.C., dating to the early 19th century, will tell a similar tale of life during slavery. The clapboard cabin, which will display the narrow confines of slave life, was dismantled piece by piece and shipped to Washington last May, where it will be reassembled for an exhibition called "Slavery and Freedom" when the museum opens.

The guard tower and the railway car will be part of the museum's first exhibit called "Defending Freedom, Defining Freedom: Era of Segregation 1876-1968."


Now, some 70 years after doing all it could to block black reporters, the White House Correspondents' Association is looking to make amends, dedicating a scholarship for journalism students in McAlpin's name. McAlpin, who died in 1985, will be honored at the association's annual scholarship dinner on May 3.

Roosevelt's invitation did nothing to change the attitude of WHCA members. One member made an indirect threat: He suggested to McAlpin that if he did attend, "someone" could get hurt in the rush of reporters moving into the room. If McAlpin chose to stay away, that reporter promised, he'd share his notes from the news conference with him.


"Harry McAlpin was a remarkable man. We honor his role as the first black reporter to cover a presidential press conference. And we acknowledge that he did that in spite of opposition from the White House Correspondents' Association of the time," said Steven Thomma, the current association president and McClatchy's government and politics editor. "Thanks to the work of Harry McAlpin, and men and women in the decades that followed, the White House press corps and the White House Correspondents' Association is a diverse chorus of faces and voices. The country is better for it."

McAlpin "ever so politely declined the offer," said White House reporter George Condon. Instead, he stepped into the White House, thereby breaking the color barrier.


McAlpin's son, Sherman, calls his father's history-making stint at the White House just one facet of a life well-lived, including serving as the president of the NAACP chapter in Louisville, Ky.

Condon, a former WHCA president, has been researching the group's history. He is doing so in celebration of the WHCA's hundredth anniversary this year.


Exceptions to the daily-only rule had been made, but not for black reporters, Condon said.

McAlpin said his father replied: "I always thought the White House press would be the cream of the crop. I can't imagine that would happen. But if it did, it would be the story of the year and I wouldn't want to miss it.' "

In a short news conference in FIFA's Zurich headquarters, Blatter admitted no wrongdoing but acknowledged he had lost the support of "the entire world of football," and called for an election to select his successor. Blatter will remain president until a new election, and no date has been set. Until he steps down, Blatter said, he will focus on imposing "far-reaching, fundamental reforms" in the organization that oversees the world's most popular sport.

It is not known what led Blatter to quit. However, an American law enforcement official said that Blatter is under investigation for wrongdoing. Blatter will remain president of FIFA until someone else is elected. FIFA stands for the French name, Fédération Internationale de Football Association. It is a sports league like the American NBA or the NFL, but its teams are in about 200 different countries. In most of the world, soccer is called football.


"I cherish FIFA more than anything and I want to do only what is best for FIFA and for football," said Blatter, 79, who has served as FIFA president since 1998. "FIFA needs a profound overhaul."

## Boss Says He Did Nothing Wrong


The admission of a need for massive change — including term limits for leadership and an overhaul of the powerful executive committee — represented a startling reversal for Blatter, who Friday told the assembled delegates of FIFA's member nations that "we don't need revolutions; we just need evolutions."

At FIFA's offices in Switzerland, Blatter said he did nothing wrong. He admitted he had lost the support of "the entire world of football." Blatter said he plans to make important reforms in FIFA while he is still president.


Tuesday's announcement means the beginning of the end of a long career for Blatter, a Swiss native who worked in public relations for the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation and for a watch manufacturer before joining FIFA in 1975. In 1981, he was appointed FIFA general secretary, and for years before he ascended to the presidency, Blatter played a leading role negotiating the lucrative television rights associated with the World Cup, which provides much of FIFA's revenue.

South African officials have denied paying the bribe. Valcke has not been charged with a crime.


Wilmar Valdez, the vice president of Conmebol, the South American soccer confederation, expressed surprise over the resignation. "Something had to have happened for him to make this decision," he was quoted as saying.

"They hate soccer," Maradona said of FIFA officials. Maradona said it is time to stop the bribes and secrets. "Enough lying to the people," Maradona said.


"He's stood down. He's gone. Let's celebrate," Dyke told the British Broadcasting Corp. "This is nothing to do with Mr. Blatter being honorable. He hasn't been honorable in years."

Hans Sarpei is a German-Ghanaian former professional soccer player. He tweeted, "I'll go to my office now and dance with joy."


Others cautioned that Blatter's decision to resign was just the first step in rehabilitating soccer's image. Vincent Kompany, captain of the Manchester City soccer club, wrote on Twitter that Blatter wasn't the only one responsible for the sport's den-of-thieves reputation. Soccer, Kompany wrote, still needs "transparency and voting reform, then we move on and bring back ethics."

"This is the absolutely right decision, and it is overdue," said Wolfgang Niersbach, the president of the German Football Association. He said Blatter should have quit earlier.

"Are there solid objects in here, or are there sparse objects in here?" asked his instructor, Brian Bushway.

Bushway lost his eyesight in the eighth grade from optic nerve atrophy. But walking through school in Mission Viejo, California, he could still see columns in the hallway, even count them. He was baffled. He closed his eyes and they were still there.

"The brain creates images," he said. It does not matter if you send it patterns of light or sound.


When he met Kish in 1996 at the Braille Institute in Anaheim, California, he told him about this phenomenon. Kish concluded that his brain was forming a spatial image from the ambient sound reflecting off and sluicing through the columns.

Since Kish started the group in 2001, his team has traveled to more than 34 countries.


Bushway, who had loved to play ice hockey and mountain bike, was inspired to see Kish breaking through the barriers that he was terrified would cage him in.

Brandon Shin, 17, came to Kish for help two years ago.


College sports teams are all but off-limits to the disabled, but UC Berkeley hopes to pry open the door with goalball, a bruising and sometimes bloody sport in which sightless players rely on sound, touch, communication and grit to hurl a sphere roughly the size of a basketball across an 18-meter court, past three opponents and into their goal.

## The Bells Of The Ball


Between 35 and 50 blind students attend the university, said Matt Grigorieff, a graduate student who founded Cal's Athletics for All to include people with disabilities in recreational and competitive sports.

The referee rolled the ball to the team's star, Will Slason. He whipped the ball to the other end of the court. Jessica Adams slid on the floor to block the ball from going into the goal. It hit her in the chest with a thump.


At a recent scrimmage, a referee reminded everyone to be quiet — an important rule, as the athletes need to be able to hear what's happening on the court.

## Blinders Make It Fair


"For sure, the first time you play it's scary. It's easy to get disoriented," Adams said. "It's also scary playing against Will."

Players wear pads to protect them from all the diving and sliding in the game. They don't wear face masks. They learn to guard their faces with their arms during games.

"He counts strokes, absolutely," Sirois said. "At a meet, we'll tap him to let him know when to turn, when to finish."

"I like that I had good competition in every race," he said. "In all the races, there was someone who I barely beat or who barely beat me."


Despite this insistence, some basic accommodations do exist to ensure his safety. He holds a cane for guidance around the pool at meets. He relied on assistant coach Adam Washburn at the state meet to help him navigate around unfamiliar territory.

One of the hallmarks of a warm PDO is the gathering of warm waters along the Pacific Coast of North America, a situation very similar to the blob, researchers say.

Scientists believe that the Pacific Ocean began a cold phase in the late 1990s. This cold phase caused temperatures to drop worldwide. On the other hand, if it flips, a warm phase could increase temperatures around the world. It could also create wetter weather for Southern California and the American South.


"We've definitely entered a warm phase," said Nicholas Bond, a climatologist for the state of Washington and the scientist who coined the "blob" nickname. "The question now is, how long is it going to last?"

"I think we may be shifting from a cool, dry phase to a warm, wet phase," said William Patzert, a climatologist. He is a scientist who studies climate. If he is correct, the 4-year-old California drought could be almost over.


Scientists first described the PDO in 1997, after investigating the question of why Pacific salmon populations could flourish for years on end, then mysteriously collapse. They identified a recurring pattern of interaction between the atmosphere and the sea that either cooled waters along the Pacific Coast or warmed them.

## Rice Cakes And Potato Chips


Cooler waters contained a bounty of fatty, nutrition-packed plankton — tiny sea creatures that form the base of the marine food chain and contributed to greater numbers of salmon. Warmer waters brought leaner, less nutritious plankton.

Scientists first described the PDO in 1997. They wanted to know why Pacific salmon could flourish for years on end, then mysteriously disappear. They discovered the reason in a pattern that either cooled waters along the coast or warmed them.


Matt Newman, a climate scientist at the University of Colorado, studies the underlying processes that drive the PDO and says the blob doesn't fit the pattern.

This year, Penn State University climatologist Michael Mann said that warm ocean water would make global warming worse.

The Boeing 777 has been seen as one of the safest aircraft in the skies today.

Asiana Airlines' pilots have a reputation for being "cowboys," says one aviation expert. Many of the pilots trained in the South Korean military.


However, it has not been devoid of incidents. In 2008, a 777 operated by British Airways crash-landed in England at Heathrow Airport's southern runway. An investigation into the crash found the plane — which was carrying 152 people at the time — had lost power because a buildup of ice had restricted fuel flowing into the engines.

## A Workhorse For Long Flights


The airline carries a combination of business travelers from Asia and visitors on package tours traveling to the U.S. As part of the Star Alliance, Asiana also draws fliers connecting with flights on United Airlines and US Airways, among other alliance members, said Joe Brancatelli, an online columnist on business travel.

"This is very obvious what happened," Herbst said. "They landed short of the runway. They were too low for the flight path and the tail of the aircraft hit the sea wall."

But confronted by an angry backlash and concerns that the ban had shamed the county, the board backed down and scheduled a special meeting Wednesday in order to reconsider the book's status.

The board voted 5-2 to ban the book. The vote came after the mother of an 11th-grader complained. She said that the book was "too much for teenagers."


Russell Perreault, a Vintage spokesman, said, "We can only hope the attempt to ban the book will bring even more readers to Ralph Ellison's magnificent novel."

"This book is filthier, too much for teenagers," she wrote.


"It's a modern classic," Holt said. "It has been part of most high school and college curricula for very many years, and a highly respected mainstay in the collections of our nation's public libraries."

Banning the book "just doesn't fit the values of the Randolph County I know," Rakoff said.


The mother and daughter were among park visitors delighted by Evanston Public Library's new book bike, a motorized bicycle with a bright yellow cart attachment filled with about 50 books of various genres.

Kira Porton, store manager of A Children's Place Bookstore in Portland, Oregon, says the guides could well become as popular as such top-selling series as "The Diary of a Wimpy Kid" and "Percy Jackson." Knowing little about "Minecraft" herself, she had initially ordered just a few copies of the guides and found herself repeatedly asking for more.

"We first heard from kids themselves about 'Minecraft,'" said Debra Dorfman, a vice president at Scholastic. "We started watching a lot of YouTube videos to see what the buzz was about. Kids, parents and teachers were all saying 'Minecraft' was good for you."


"They're in the process of just exploding," Porton says. "What's amazing is that we usually have to personally recommend books for them to sell that well. These books just fly off the shelf without our having to say anything."

Dorfman said teachers were talking about how "Minecraft" helps kids learn about science, math and solving problems. Parents were letting kids play for hours at a time.

SASABE, Ariz. — On a windy day in southern Arizona's remote borderlands, Glenn Weyant had everything he needed to make music — a cello bow, a mallet and the miles-long fence dividing the United States and Mexico.

SASABE, Ariz. — On a windy day near the Arizona border with Mexico, Glenn Weyant had everything he needed to make music. He had his cello bow and a hammer. But, he wasn't going to play a musical instrument. He plays the fence dividing the United States and Mexico.


In Nogales, he played a fence made of re-purposed helicopter landing pads, sometimes creating a staccato sound. He'd capture the noise from birds landing on top of the fence, and the sounds of cars and people passing through the port of entry.

In Sasabe, he created a delicate raspy sound. He played rusty mattress wires with his cello bow. Ranchers had stretched the wires between fence posts to keep their cattle from straying into Mexico.

"Making the inhumane, humane and human," one person commented on a YouTube video of Weyant making music. "Bravo. Beautiful. Inspiring." In this recording, Weyant rarely touched the wall and mostly amplified the sound the wind created blowing across rocks and through the fence.

"Why are you playing a wall?" one asked.


"I'm a white male playing the border wall," Weyant said. "I'm aware of my privileged status."

Joe Ebert, of Hampton, N.H., was cheering on his son-in-law near the spot in downtown Boston where the bombs went off. He was there last year, too.

"I think I'm going to start crying at the starting line," said Katie O'Donnell, a doctor at Children's Hospital. O'Donnell was stopped less than a mile from the end last year. "I'm not sure I'll stop until I cross the finish line."


Sabrina Dello Russo, 38, of South Boston, was running her first marathon for a good friend, Roseann Sdoia, who lost her right leg in the bombing.

Jeff Bauman was one of the onlookers at the finish line. Bauman lost his legs in the bombing. It was the first time he had returned to the area since the attack.


While Gov. Deval Patrick said there had been no specific threats against the race or the city, spectators at the 118th running of the world's oldest annual marathon had to go through tight checkpoints before being allowed near the starting and finish lines.

"It feels great" to be back, he said. "I feel very safe."

"There's a real appetite, a real hunger from the IOC members I've talked to for the United States to get its act together and have the Games again," said Ed Hula, editor of Around the Rings, an Atlanta website that covers the Olympics. Hula said Boston's main competition would come from Europe.

Davey points to money savers such as using college and university sites to host events, and promises "the most walkable Games in history." (The definition of walkable is fairly loose. Planners envision holding preliminary rounds of baseball, soccer and basketball as far away as Washington, Chicago and New York.)

Ed Hula runs Around the Rings, a website that writes about the Olympics. Hula said Boston's main competition to host the games would come from European cities.


The bid also includes construction of a $400 million temporary main stadium in an area that is, arguably, the least walkable section in Boston: a collection of meat and fish processing plants and warehouses between a rail yard and highway overpasses leading into downtown. It's hard on a frigid day to imagine 80,000 spectators flocking to a spot now covered in gray mounds of snow and reeking of seafood.

"Everything we worked on ended up being used," Holm said after the fight, which 56,214 people watched at a stadium. Holm now has 10 wins and no losses.


Rousey, 28, is six years younger than Holm, but she appeared gassed by the end of the first round. She badly missed with a punch that Holm ducked and was repeatedly pelted by Holm's left hand, including one punch that set up the decisive left kick to the head.

Rousey seemed ready for the match. In Rousey's three fights before facing Holm, she beat three other mixed martial artists in seconds. This made her one of the best-known athletes in the world.


"I wanted to move and be precise," Holm said. "Not too cautious. I wanted to go forward in a smart way, not let her bum-rush me to the cage."

"This is the fight I went after," White said. "Holly, we said it at the time, had the range, uses her distance very well, has great head kicks. Everything we talked about is essentially what went down.

Unless Brady's suspension is reduced on appeal, he will not be eligible to return until an Oct. 18 Sunday night game at Indianapolis, the team that blew the whistle on the Patriots in the AFC title game.

The Patriots won the game against the Colts, 45-7. Two weeks later, the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.


"It's a good thing the @nfl suspended Tom Brady now everyone knows that NOBODY is above the system," former NFL linebacker Shawne Merriman wrote on Twitter, concluding with the hashtag #FairGame.

## Was It The Weather?


By every indication, the incident has not dimmed Brady's star one iota among Patriots' fans. He was cheered enthusiastically last week, one day after the Wells report was released, when he spoke at an event at Salem State University in Massachusetts. And there were loud boos when the moderator, journalist Jim Gray, asked whether the deflation controversy tainted New England's Super Bowl championship.

"If you hate the Patriots you're going to say those guys always cheat," Gannon said.  "But if Tom Brady had 12.5 pounds of pressure in those footballs or 11, what difference does it make? He's still one of the greatest quarterbacks ever. But the bottom line is, the rules were violated and there's a price to pay."

Whereas cerebellar activity observed in the study is significant due to the fact it was unexpected, the fMRI data measured activity changes in a variety of other brain regions as well. According to Lisa Azziz-Zadeh, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Southern California who was not involved in the study, the findings are "representative of the interconnectivity of the different regions of the brain" and demonstrate the need to develop new neurological models of higher cognition, including creativity.

## Don't Think, Just Do It


In particular, the study provided evidence for the "practice-makes-perfect" mechanism of brain function, by which "cerebellar circuits run subconsciously once they are learned," Ramnani says. We know, for instance, that the cerebrum's motor cortex is active when we are learning new movements, then the cerebellum assumes responsibility for coordinating the movement in order to free up the cerebral motor cortex for further learning. The fact that cerebellar activity decreased when study participants faced a cognitively challenging task but increased when the task required little conscious thought supports the hypothesis that the cerebellum functions in cognition in much the same way it functions in motor control. If so, according to Reiss, "it's likely the cerebellum is the coordination center of the brain, allowing other regions to be more efficient."

The results were surprising: the prefrontal cortex, traditionally associated with thinking, was busiest for the most difficult drawings. Even more surprising, the cerebellum was busiest for the drawings the participants scored highest on for creativity. Basically, the less the participants thought about what they were drawing, the more creative their drawings were.


That reshuffling revealed a more dynamic map of the brain, characterized by recruitment, integration and shifting allegiances over time.

"Any athlete will tell you this: If you're skilled at something and you start thinking about it, especially at a detailed level, you're just dead in the water," said Scott Grafton, a scientist at UC Santa Barbara. "It's OK" to think when you're practicing, but not when you want to become skilled at the task, he explained.


When we look at chunks of space rock and piles of sand and "see" a crab, or a lizard, or an alien spaceship, we're being tricked, he said. Not by NASA, but by our own brains.

Ashwin Vasavada works on the Mars rover project for NASA. He insists that scientists are not trying to hide evidence of alien life.


The phenomenon is called pareidolia, and it explains why we so often find Jesus in our food, the Virgin Mary in tree trunks, a man in the moon, Hitler in teapots and pumpkin-headed aliens on Mars.

"There is no group that would be happier to see such a thing," he said. Though so far, they have not found aliens.


Occasionally it leads us astray.

## We See What We See, Or Do We?


"Human brains are uniquely wired to recognize faces, so that even when there's only a slight suggestion of facial features, the brain automatically interprets it as a face," Kang Lee, a psychologist at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the Cortex article, said in a statement at the time.

Scientist Carl Sagan wrote in "The Demon-Haunted World" that "As soon as the infant can see, it recognizes faces, and we now know that this skill is hardwired in our brains. Those infants who a million years ago were unable to recognize a face smiled back less, were less likely to win the hearts of their parents," and thrive.


Scientists still don't entirely understand how that process works, but they know that it's linked to dyslexia, synesthesia (the phenomenon that allows people to "taste" words or associate numbers with colors) and prosopagnosia, a disorder that affects the ability to recognize faces. Even when this area is working completely normally, it can lead us to see things that aren't really there.

People make fun of those who claim to find aliens in NASA photographs. Scientists say all humans think this way.

She did not cite Williams' remarks about his experience covering Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which helped win the anchor a Peabody Award. He described seeing a body floating through the French Quarter of New Orleans and fending off marauding gangs at the hotel where he stayed. Both accounts have been disputed by local news media and authorities.

NBC News President Deborah Turness confirmed that Williams "misrepresented events."


"If he comes back, how big a ratings hole will NBC find themselves in and can he dig out of it?" said Jon Klein, a former top executive for CNN and CBS News. "Or does the opposite happen and Lester does just fine? If there is no impact, what does that tell you?"

The question now is what happens during the six months Williams is off the air.


The blow of losing Williams for a while will be felt more in the morale at NBC News.

While other programs at NBC news have experienced viewer declines in recent years, Williams' show has stayed at the top. In December, Williams was rewarded with a five-year contract that pays him about $10 million a year.


Williams was energized about the broadcast's resilience in the face of increased competition from "ABC World News Tonight With David Muir." Executives at NBC News finally believed that they were ready to turn the corner after years of media criticism over the poor handling of talent transitions such as Ann Curry's rocky departure from the "Today" show.

## Damaged His Reputation


But the decision has riled thousands of women here (and not a few men). No disrespect to the cigar-chomping, wartime prime minister, they say. But his portrait will replace that of Elizabeth Fry, a 19th century prison reformer, which means that no female figure from Britain's past will appear anywhere on its currency — only the present queen, who is there by convention and by accident of birth, not by merit.

The choice would seem to be easy. Churchill is well-known as the Prime Minister who led the country as it battled Nazi Germany in World War II. The bank called him "a hero of the entire free world."


"It's another instance of women's contributions being wiped out," she said. "It's something everyone will see whether they consciously notice it or not. It's in everyone's wallet, and we see it every day."

The controversy scuttled any hopes that the Bank of England's Mervyn King might have had of spending his final days as its governor in a warm bath of unalloyed admiration. Instead, activists and columnists kept up a cold shower of criticism, even after King hinted, before stepping down at the end of June, that novelist Jane Austen was strongly in the running to supplant Charles Darwin on the 10-pound bill.

The world's best-selling author of all time is a British woman (mystery writer Agatha Christie). So is the best-selling author in recent years (J.K. Rowling, who created Harry Potter). Yet no woman has been chosen to be added onto British money.


"What irony it is that, on the very notes that we earn and spend, we will now see no (historical) women at all," which would leave "a chasm where there once was inspiration," Macleod wrote in a letter.

Mervyn King headed the Bank of England. He spent his final days on the job facing criticism over the issue. Even after King hinted that novelist Jane Austen was strongly in the running to replace Charles Darwin on the 10-pound bill, he still got complaints.


Portraits of famous Britons other than the monarch began popping up on bills in 1970; the first was William Shakespeare. Since then, only two women have made the cut: Fry and nursing pioneer Florence Nightingale. Churchill will be the 14th man, joining the likes of author Charles Dickens, economist Adam Smith and composer Edward Elgar.

The least expensive option would require Parliament to move out of the Palace of Westminster for six years. That's called a "full decant" — an apt description for a place where lawmakers hobnob in their own private bar overlooking the Thames and where some have been known to cast votes on legislation in a "tired and emotional" state (a popular euphemism for "falling-down drunk").

The most expensive option would let most members of Parliament to stay put. Different parts of the building would be closed over 32 years. It would cost $8.8 billion. Still, the plan would just cover only basic repairs.


Pooh stayed in the publisher's office until 1987, when he donated it to the New York Power Authority, which handed it over to the New York Public Library. That bear is now on display "in the basement" of the library, as the British press has sniffed recently.

Pooh is not a native New Yorker. He is actually from England. Recently, some people in England have been asking to have the bear sent back home.


The Times built a case for the return of Pooh. The editorial noted that Pooh "was apparently not paid for and the English people were not consulted on its relocation across the ocean." The newspaper envisioned a specially built museum in East Sussex, near the Hundred Acre Wood that Pooh and Christopher Robin (and Piglet and Owl and Eeyore and Kanga, the stuffed animal menagerie) roamed.

## But Pooh Seems Happy In New York


Gyles Brandreth, a British writer, broadcaster and former member of Parliament, said in an interview for an article for The Times that he would very much like to see Pooh "pay a visit to his homeland." But he noted that he'd chatted with Christopher Robin about the matter.

LONDON — Britain's education minister says he has not killed a mockingbird, but many literature lovers don't believe him.

LONDON — British teenagers won't be studying "To Kill A Mockingbird" and other American literature for a major high school exam anymore. Michael Gove, the country's education minister, called for more British works to be studied.


"The idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is crazy," said John Carey, a literary critic and emeritus professor at Oxford University.

## Off With Their Literary Heads


Critics of the new English rules say they will have a restrictive, rather than broadening, effect.

"I have not banned anything," he wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper. "All we are doing is asking exam boards to broaden — not narrow — the books young people study for GCSE."


Some educators welcomed Gove's attempts to raise standards. Jonathan Bate, an English professor at Oxford who advised on the latest curriculum changes, said he had been discouraged to discover that many pupils studied no British novels for their GCSE course.

Gove has been education secretary in Britain's government since 2010. He has faced strong opposition to his plans before. Many professors condemned his plan for history lessons to teach students more about British history. A Cambridge professor said Gove's changes to primary education took schools back to Victorian times.


The new book lists include a wide sample of modern British literature and drama, from George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and William Golding's "Lord of the Flies" to Kazuo Ishiguro's novel "Never Let Me Go," Alan Bennett's play "The History Boys" and "Anita and Me," a coming-of-age novel by comedian and author Meera Syal.

The 19th-century books on the lists include "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens and "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.


In Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron defended the decision to close down operations in Portsmouth, noting that the city's dockyards would continue to repair and maintain warships, just not build them. Although 940 jobs will be lost next year, 11,000 in the industry will remain, he said.

Royal Navy ships will still be built in Britain. But they will be built only in Scotland. Great Britain includes England, Scotland and Wales.


Perhaps just as hurtful to the city as the economic blow, however, is the loss of its historic status as the center of British shipbuilding, the busy workshop that helped turn a small island into a maritime power with a vast worldwide empire at its command.

Prime Minister David Cameron defended the decision to close down shipbuilding in Portsmouth. He said that the city's dockyards would continue to repair and keep warships in good shape. Ships just will not be built there. Yes, 940 jobs will be lost next year. But 11,000 in the shipbuilding business will remain, he said.


The ship sank 34 years later during a skirmish with the French fleet. The wreck lay undisturbed on the seabed for nearly 300 years until a diver accidentally came across it. The Mary Rose was raised from the water in 1982 and is now a prime tourist attraction.

Philip Hammond is in charge of Britain's military. He denied that the next year's vote was the reason to keep Scotland's shipyards going. He said the government would spend $160 million on work to fix ships in Portsmouth. The spending is an effort to make the effects of the job cuts less tough to take.


Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the leader of the Portsmouth City Council, said the British government was putting itself in a dicey position by eliminating shipbuilding in England.

The nearly 300-page study analyzed 477 different physical features of 81 sauropod specimens, involving five years of research and numerous visits to museum collections in Europe and the United States. The initial goal of the research was to clarify the relationships among the species making up the family of sauropods known as the diplodocids, which includes Diplodocus, Apatosaurus and now Brontosaurus.

The Antiquity paper focused on recent archaeological work at the Maya Devi Temple at Lumbini, said to be the site of Buddha's birth. The dig, which was financed by the Japanese and Nepalese governments and the National Geographic Society, was done within the shrine.

## A Temple Built Of Wood


Robin Coningham, the paper's lead author and professor of archeology at Durham University in Britain, said the dig revealed a previously undiscovered temple built of wood beneath a succession of later brick temples.

The problem is that nothing was written down about him during his life. Writings on monuments that were built in his memory have been found. The Indian emperor Ashoka built several in the 3rd century B.C. Those provide some clues. But, there isn't much evidence from before that.


The original timber structure appears to have been built around an open space that likely held a tree, the authors wrote.

The team dug at the Maya Devi Temple at Lumbini. Buddha is believed to have been born at the site of that temple. The scientists dug inside to find the buried temple.


The first Lumbini shrine was likely built by wealthy adherents of Buddhism at a time when the religion was considered a cult.

But it would delay a requirement for people to purchase coverage or face a penalty, and the creation of marketplaces, which are supposed to start functioning this Tuesday, where people could shop for coverage from private insurers.

In 2009, mathematician Tim Chartier and his students at Davidson College devised a formula to pick winners in the NCAA men's basketball tournament better than almost anyone else. That year, using strength of schedule and late season hot streaks, combined with middle school algebra, the Davidson math class out-picked 97 percent of the 4 million bracketeers in ESPN's annual March Madness contest.

In January, mathematician Tim Chartier heard that one of the richest men in the world is sponsoring a contest. Its prize is $1 billion.


"The moment I heard it, I said to my wife, 'I think things are going to get quite complicated for me this year,'" Chartier said of the Billion Dollar Bracket Challenge.

In truth, Bergen says, a bracketeer's chances of taking Buffett's money aren't quite that bleak.

The soft-spoken Del Castillo dropped out of high school at 17, but said training to be a bullfighter has made him more disciplined, but with great sacrifice. His father refused to talk to him for six months, and he works odd jobs to pay his rent.

The 77-year-old Rincon's goal is to change the art of bullfighting. He wants to add new expressions and movements that have never been tried before. His son did the same thing when he thrilled audiences worldwide.


On a recent afternoon, Cesar Rincon watched a tienta, or a test of young bulls and cows, from a viewing area above a small ring at the historic Achury Viejo bull ranch in the hills outside the capital.

The soft-spoken Del Castillo dropped out of high school at 17. He said training to be a bullfighter has made him more disciplined. But he has made big sacrifices. His father refused to talk to him for six months. He works odd jobs to pay his rent.


Bullfighters, too, have had to get a second job. Santiago Naranjo, 28, a matador since 2010, has a retail store at a Bogota shopping center and studies business administration.

Bogota's fancy Plaza de Toros de Santamaria has been closed for the past two years. The city's mayor gave his support to people who are against bullfighting.


In January, Bosch Rexroth started hiring high school interns in the plant that makes manufacturing equipment. Rucker-Shivers was chosen, along with Carla Bailey, a senior at Hopewell High in Huntersville, N.C.

Five out of 10 summer interns were offered apprenticeships, but not Rucker-Shivers. This taught him another lesson. "You're not a kid anymore." You have to work without being told what to do and solve problems, he said.


Educators' enthusiasm about high-tech career training is tempered by one reality: Creating labs at schools is expensive. That's another benefit of partnerships. A school district may not be able to afford to create machine shops at high schools, but students can go to real workplaces.

Bosch staff will not discuss pay. Realon says a national report shows machinist technicians can earn $60,000 to $100,000 a year.

That deception is news for 75 percent of the Papilio polytes ladies, which can avoid predators that have learned not to dine on the real toxic butterfly. They're a classic example of "parasitic" mimicry, a strictly one-sided affair that benefits only the imitator, but leaves the male and the masculine-colored female vulnerable.

The problem is unknown to 75 percent of the swallowtail butterfly ladies. Because they look like a poisonous butterfly, they are left alone by predators. But while masquerading as another species works just fine for them, the male and the masculine-colored female are still at risk.


"They figured that this is a cluster of tightly linked genes, and each individual gene was doing some sub-set of that color pattern, but they were so close together that they would all be inherited as a single unit," said University of Chicago evolutionary biologist Marcus R. Kronforst, who has studied butterflies for decades. "That's where the name 'super gene' came from. They just couldn't imagine that a single gene could do all this."

## Why Just The Females?


In an emailed response, Monsanto spokeswoman Charla Lord said:

These environmentalists wrote a report, called a petition. They asked Fish and Wildlife to protect the disappearing insect.


The environmental and food-safety groups say the butterfly's population has fallen from a high of 1 billion in the mid-1990s to about 35 million last year, and that number is only about a tenth of the 20-year average. The monarch is also threatened by climate change, drought and heat waves, urban sprawl and logging on their wintering grounds in Mexico, the petitioners said.

The environmentalists said that the use of Roundup and other crops has "wiped out milkweed plants."


The Missouri Department of Conservation has been monitoring the monarch's decline. The organization's Tim Smith predicted on the agency's website in April that "the sight of the beautiful orange and black monarch butterfly in Missouri is likely to be less common this year."

Charla Lord is a spokeswoman for Monsanto. She said there are many reasons the monarchs might be dying. She believes that "weather events" and "logging in Mexico" kill milkweed. She said that Monsanto would help restore the habitats.


The prospectors are well aware of the pain the drought has brought their state. No one is happy about that, but they are gleeful and unrepentant about their new quest, to find a silver lining in flecks of gold.

## Wading In The River


But for one small, proud, iconoclastic community — gold prospectors — the drought has been a boon.

What's going on today is less like a rush. It's more like a fever.


But the signs are everywhere, and in many places where prospectors feel a deep connection to California's rich history — in Lytle Creek near San Bernardino, named for a Mormon settler in the 1850s; in the San Gabriel River, named after a mission founded by Junipero Serra in 1771; in the Bear River of the Sierra Nevada, where prospectors first arrived during the fabled Gold Rush of 1849.

## Straining The Muck


This is not a new gold rush; it pales in comparison to the real thing in the mid-1800s, when prospectors sometimes just bent down and plucked nuggets of gold off the dirt. Particularly with legal limits on the use of mechanized machines that vacuum up large amounts of sediment, it's not a moneymaking scheme for the vast majority of prospectors.

"Not all that long ago, this would have been underwater," said Jeanne Nelle.


"It is such an unprecedented lack of snow," said Frank Gehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Survey Program. He's been attending the snowpack measurements since 1987 and said he had never before seen the ground barren of snow on April 1. "It's way below the records."

Frank Gehrke has been part of California's snow survey program since 1987. He said there is always snow on the ground on April 1.

## "Ringing The Alarm Bells"


Since Affirmed last won the Triple Crown in 1978, more horses have completed the Derby-Preakness double (12) without adding the third jewel than have won all three in the series' 139-year history (11).

No horse has won the Triple Crown in 36 years.


California Chrome jockey Victor Espinoza rode War Emblem to victory in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 2002, and said he'll likely enjoy himself more this time around.

Spectacular Bid won the series' first two races in 1979. He lost at Belmont, starting a trend of horses nearly getting the Triple Crown, then losing at Belmont.


"They don't want a Triple Crown winner," he said. "They want a paycheck."

## How's The Competition?


Kid Cruz trainer Linda Rice also said California Chrome has a chance to join the list of Triple Crown winners, and that the absence of one since Affirmed proves just how hard it is.

He said only horses who ran the Kentucky Derby should be allowed in the Preakness and the Belmont. Horses should have to run the Preakness to be in the Belmont, he said.


Thanks to storms in late 2012, the last water year — a period that ended Sept. 30 and covered all of the last rainy season — was far from the worst. It ranks as the 29th driest water year on record, according to the California Climate Tracker at the Western Regional Climate Center in Reno.

"Folsom Lake — it's pretty obvious there's a problem," said water manager Shauna Lorance. Her system delivers Folsom water to the suburbs ringing Sacramento. The big landscaped lots and irrigated horse pastures in those areas drive the district's per-person water use to about 369 gallons a day. That is three times the rate in Los Angeles.


"We get people from LA and Orange County and they are terrified of black bears," she said. "And grizzlies?"

## Little Love For The Big Bears


Historically, grizzly populations were most dense along the California coast, in the estuaries of big river valleys — the Sacramento, San Joaquin and American — and in San Luis Obispo, Los Osos and the Bay Area.

## No Hotel California For Grizzlies


Those lush tule marshes and coastal valleys offered bears a cornucopia of food at every turn: Pronghorn antelope and tule elk, an abundant acorn crop in the fall and plenty of big fish. Fat grizzlies used to roam the Pacific's beaches feasting on washed-up whale carcasses.

Finding a space for them in California may not be possible. Historically, grizzlies lived along the California coast. They stayed in the river valleys and near the ocean in the northern half of the state.


Noah Greenwald of the Center for Biological Diversity, which petitioned federal officials to reintroduce the grizzly, said his organization sees the southern Sierra as the best choice in California. His group envisions releasing 300 to 400 bears in the region, a tract of public land with overlapping parks and wilderness areas.

Noah Greenwald works for a wildlife group that asked government officials to bring the grizzly back. His group wants to release 300 to 400 bears in the mountains of eastern California.


Greenwald acknowledged the need to proceed cautiously. "At this point what we are proposing is studying the idea," Greenwald said. "This is a long-term project."

## Fearsome Fighter If Threatened


William Grindley, a former World Bank executive and an opponent of the project, has warned the system will fail financially unless demand skyrockets and ticket prices increase sharply. "Can the proposed California bullet train break even? The answer is unequivocally no," he said.

"The train will lose money," said Joseph Vranich. It will need money from the state, he said. Vranich used to be president of a U.S. group that wants the country to have high-speed trains.


Another 2,000 ethnic Cambodians in the U.S. are on the deportation list because of their criminal records and could be picked up at any time.

At first there were just a trickle of deportations. Recently it has turned into a flood. The total number is now estimated at around 400.


"Many individuals are going about their ordinary lives. Working, studying, raising their families, but any knock on the door could be the immigration officers," said Bill Herod, an American pastor who lives in Cambodia and has been involved in helping the returnees since the first groups arrived in 2002. "It's a terrible injustice, but it's legal."

"It's averaged about 10 deportees a month between 2009 and now," said Keo Sarith. He directs a Phnom Penh-based support center set up to help returnees.


Most of the deportees arrive in Cambodia with little more than the clothes on their backs and what money they have in their pockets. U.S. marshals escort them off the plane, but there's very little to sustain them when they arrive.

"For a decade after I was released, I had no issues with the law. Ten years working, paying taxes and not even a traffic ticket," he said, shaking his head.


Like many, one of the biggest difficulties for Touch is knowing that unless the law changes he will never be allowed back into the U.S., even on compassionate grounds. "Those who get sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. at least get to see their families at weekend visitations, and if someone dies they take you to the funeral," he said. "If my parents pass away I won't even get to attend their funerals."

Later in her life, she hopes to return to teach English as a second language. She said that being at Hopeworks makes her want to share her skills.


In a paper published Monday in PNAS, she argues that conversations that take place at night around a fire have a different quality, and different content, than those that take place during the day.

## Talking During The Day


In 1974 Wiessner spent two months recording conversations between the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen, what was then a group of foragers in northeast Namibia and northwest Botswana in southwestern Africa. Today they make only a small part of their living foraging.

"I think people are much more open at night by a fire," said Wiessner, who teaches at the University of Utah. Wiessner said that people always check other people's expressions. "But at night, people are mostly staring into the fire and expressions are concealed."


At night, however, when the Ju/'hoansi Bushmen gathered around a fire, 81 percent of the conversation revolved around storytelling.

The conversations took place between at least four or five adults and lasted for 20 to 30 minutes. She recorded 122 conversations during the day. About 31 percent of them were about searching for food or technology. Another 34 percent were devoted to speaking harshly about other people. Joking made up 16 percent of the conversations. Stories made up just 6 percent.


"Like hunter-gatherers, we work our imaginations, gain new perspectives and expand our horizons from stories," she writes in the paper. "Even so, artificial light and digital communication are invading the night worldwide, turning hours of darkness into economically productive time and overriding social time and story time."
## Nighttime Still Spent With Stories


But the show must go on, says Gelfand, who not only has been a Berkeley camper for nearly three decades, but also has written and produced the staff musical that's performed each Saturday night.

It will be sad when Berkeley campers sing the old campfire song at the new camp. The song goes, "There's no place like Camp Tuolumne, there's no spot that I would rather be."


"The camp lives inside you and friendships never die," Gelfand said, "even if they get burned down."
It has a happy ending.

"It gave us a chance to become children again," said Arcand, fighting back tears. "We shared our tears, we shared our laughs, but we dug deep inside and we dug out the demons and we couldn't have done it without each other."

Sinclair said that they were releasing the report to educate the Canadian people. He said that the purpose of the report is not to make people feel bad. He said the group wants people to learn how hurtful these laws can be.


"The government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks for forgiveness of the aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly," Trudeau said. "At the same time, today there is reason for hope. Today we find ourselves on a new path, working together towards a nation-to-nation relationship based on recognition, rights, respect, cooperation and partnership."

"We did this for the children who were taken away and for the parents who were left behind to cry for them," Sinclair said. "We did this for the children of today who needed to know where and what, and why things had occurred so they can understand their lives, themselves and their future better."

Peter could not stand. He dragged his body along and could not hold down food.


Peter has run a 5K race. He plays second base on his Little League team. He swims and dives. And he dreams of pitching in the major leagues, a goal he has shared with his friend David Dravecky, the former San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres pitcher who lost his throwing arm to the same kind of tumor that took Peter's leg.

## "The Best Gift"


Two months later, the Zuccas found themselves simultaneously planning Peter's first birthday and his funeral.

Dawn begged that the leg be cut off.


"We had all these cry stations upstairs and on the porches," said Dawn, 51, a former office manager. "But nobody was allowed to cry on the first floor. We wanted it to be a celebration of his life."

The hardest part, Peter said, is "not being able to play the same way."

Grainge said the changes are not trying to change Capitol into something new. The owners only tried to help the employees, who already had the skills, talent and dedication, he said. Universal Music wanted to nurture Capitol back to success by helping its people. Two years later, Capitol is on a new path.


Other marine parks are making changes. Among them:

"We still have millions of guests coming through our parks wanting to see shows," said Chris Dold of SeaWorld. "That doesn't seem to be changing at all."


— Baltimore's National Aquarium stopped using its dolphins in shows in 2012 and announced earlier this year it is considering creating an ocean retreat for the animals.

People became upset at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in California for keeping an orca alone without another orca to keep it company. The aquarium responded by sending the animal to SeaWorld where it was able to live with other whales.


In general, "what we certainly have seen is that operators are moving away from shows, or doing more modest … kinds of educational programs," said Thomas Martin, a Massachusetts consultant to attractions, museums and aquariums.

## Leaping, Dancing Whales


She and Dold say training for shows keeps captive whales and dolphins mentally and physically healthy.

Rockets hops came to an end in 2010. In that year, an orca named Tilikum killed trainer Dawn Brancheau at SeaWorld Orlando.


Shows featuring orcas at the Shamu Stadium are a major draw. One of those shows' highlights used to be "rocket hops," in which whales propel trainers out of the water.

## California Wants New Rules


SeaWorld's renovations of its whale tanks will feature 40-foot glass windows where guests can watch the orcas swimming. SeaWorld said it also plans changes to a section of the park where guests can see dolphins swim, though it would not give further details.

In California, a new rule was introduced this year that would make orca shows against the law. The law did not get enough yes votes and needs to be studied more by lawmakers.


From the Dominican Republic in the north, to Barbados in the east, and Mexico's Caribbean resorts to the west, officials are authorizing emergency money to fund cleanup efforts and clear stinking mounds of seaweed that in some cases have piled up nearly 10 feet high on beaches, choked scenic coves and cut off moored boats.

## Insulting Opponents, Exaggerating Issues


Pat Bagley of The Salt Lake Tribune said the images that "outrage people most are those that spotlight people's sacred cows."

Kevin Siers, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist with the Charlotte Observer in North Carolina, explained that while opinion articles can balance different viewpoints, cartoons are more direct, more powerful.


Bagley said he has never had "a direct death threat," although he has received emails "from people who let me know they own guns, they know how to use them, and I should be careful."

## "Grab You Quickly"


Bagley said he couldn't remember when an American cartoonist had been assaulted or killed for his or her work. "It happens all the time in the Middle East, and it happens way too often in South America and sometimes in Europe. It's really depressing."

"A really well-drawn editorial cartoon should grab you quickly," Telnaes said.


"Terrorism really doesn't strike at physical structures as much as it strikes at ideas, and its main fear is ideas," said Jack Ohman, the organization's president and a cartoonist at The Sacramento Bee. "And cartoonists are particularly effective at distilling ideas. I find it fascinating that cartoonists that sign their names to their ideas are murdered in cold blood and terrorists ran away from the scene of their statement anonymously."

"In Europe and the Middle East, they take cartoons deadly seriously," Bagley said. "In the U.S., we're more entertainers, and we don't get quite the respect or the response they do in Europe or the Middle East."


Clay Bennett, Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist at The Chattanooga Times Free Press, thinks he understands why cartoonists elicit more threats than writers do. The writers have "a thousand pebbles to throw every day. A cartoonist has a brick."

Cartoonists are rarely attacked or killed in the U.S., Bagley said. "It happens all the time in the Middle East, and it happens way too often in South America and sometimes in Europe. It's really depressing," he said.


Satire "is the fault line between East and West," said Kevin Kallaugher, editorial cartoonist for the Economist of London and The Baltimore Sun.

Joel Pett is an award-winning cartoonist at The Lexington Herald-Leader in Kentucky. He said the massacre in France serves as a reminder for cartoonists. It should tell them not to waste their opportunity "to draw about something that matters."

Let's face it. Felines view humans as big, clumsy cats and treat us the same way they treat each other.

When cats began moving into people's homes, they were never really trained. In fact, cats quickly began to train people to do what cats wanted.


Which is not to say they haven't developed a keen ability to manipulate humans. How many cat owners have not experienced the joy of a hungry cat waking us by swatting our faces until they rouse us from sleep at 5 a.m.? And we respond as quickly to loud vocalizations of their demands as we do to a crying baby who needs a diaper change.

Cats, on the other hand, pretty much developed on their own. For that reason, they aren't as tuned in to us.


A cat gives its love begrudgingly and it must be well earned. Get used to it.
The truth is, cats live to be served and adored.


"We have the oldest but not the most primitive (species), which is interesting because it means that there are more primitive cats to be found in the fossil record that would be older than the one we have now, but just haven't been found," Tseng said.

What scientists have found suggests that big cats split off from other cats about 11 million years ago. They then evolved into various separate species. That change happened about 6 million years ago. The big cats became lions, tigers, jaguars and leopards.


Panthera blytheae was named in honor of Blythe Haaga, daughter of longtime museum philanthropists Paul and Heather Haaga, who bid for the naming rights during a museum auction.

## Asia, Not Africa?


Castillo's research comes amid a century-old debate on Catalina's fate. Catalina is unusual in that, unlike other Channel Islands off the coast of California, it does not have ancient flat beaches that have been lifted up by earthquake activity. In 1897, one researcher also suggested that Catalina was sinking as well.

"The whole island is tipping, so there definitely is a risk," he said.


Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey came to a different conclusion. A study published in 2012 in the journal Geomorphology reported what the authors said was credible evidence that the island was rising like many other places in Southern California.

Catalina was once part of the sea floor, Castillo said. Then, a series of earthquakes made it rise from the ocean. About 1 million years ago, the earthquakes became much more rare. At that point, the island began gradually sinking, he said.


On Catalina, the lack of ancient, raised flat beaches called marine terraces above sea level can be explained in two ways, he said. One, the island is moving up so fast that the ocean never has time to cut a flat beach on the shoreline. The other reason: Ancient flat beaches have been washed away by powerful streams falling off swiftly rising hills.

## Rising Or Sinking Is Still In Question


Marshall and her colleagues note that the ancient village of Quanhucun, in central China's Shaanxi province, is far beyond F. s. lybica's natural range, and raises the question of just how the cats got there.

Today, every house cat in the world comes from a single type of Middle Eastern wildcat. Cats in alleys, on YouTube videos or in your living room all come from the same place.


BAKER, Nev. — Down here in the subterranean stillness, the beam from Paul Kemp's headlamp slices through the gloom like a lighthouse beacon — his tool to unearth evidence of the invaders who have long descended into this alien world.

BAKER, Nev. — What does the National Park Service do when America's caves need a cleaning? They hold a Lint Camp.


Every so often, the cave must be emptied of such detritus, like scraping clothing lint from a dryer filter. During last month's three-day Lint Camp, two dozen volunteers from three states hauled out more than a ton of debris — including tarmac and concrete chunks from paths removed during cave restoration work.

## Trash In, Trash Out


Some deposits are broken, the legacy of an era when cave visitors believed that "If you can break it, you can take it." Remaining shapes resemble hobbits, tiny Buddhas, jellyfish, seahorses, Chinese mandarins and elephant tusks.

## Lint-Picker Rules


As Baker's group settles in, she suggests a contest to see who can fill the most bags of dust and lint. This is detail work that often requires a magnifying glass and tweezers when the lint has become moist and sticks to the formations like cobwebs. The volunteers start slowly, nervously touching the rock as though petting a skittish cat.

Since most modern humans will never get to see the masterpieces in what is widely known as the Chauvet Cave, scientists, artists and the French government have spent 56 million euros (about $60 million) and several years creating the next best thing: a near-exact replica of the cave about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) away, including more than 400 paintings of horses, bears, rhinoceros and mammoths, handprints and carvings. Experts even recreated stalactites and stalagmites from the original site, as well as the cool temperatures and thick smell of humidity.

French officials quickly closed the cave to the public. They worried that too many people in the cave could destroy the pictures. Even breathing on them could cause damage.


French President Francois Hollande unveiled the site Friday, and it opens to the public later this month.

But for Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent, or "MENA," it's a real head-scratcher. They come in a variety of phenotypes and shades — ranging from pale to deepest ebony, and hail from 22 different countries, from Iran to Egypt to Morocco. And yet, for the census, since the beginning of the last century, the MENA community has been lumped into the "white" category.

For many Americans, checking the right box on the form is easy. They quickly mark off "black," "white," "Hispanic," "Asian," "American Indian" — or all of the above.


Still, some cities and states have taken it upon themselves to try to track their MENA populations. In Michigan, which has the nation's largest concentration of Arab-Americans, the state's health department conducted a survey of the local MENA population in order to assess why the Arab-American infant mortality rate was 40 percent higher than that of whites. Since 2002, the city of San Francisco, at the behest of the MENA business community, has been holding hearings on post-9/11 discrimination against Arab, African, Middle Eastern, Muslim and South Asians. California has the largest MENA population.

She says the categories now don't fit. "More of us would identify as people of color."


Some cereal brands that aren't strongly associated with health or indulgence have been left behind. Wheaties has seen sales drop nearly 80 percent over the past 10 years. Sales of Corn Pops have dipped roughly 50 percent over that period. And Rice Krispies sales have contracted by 32 percent.

People have not stopped buying extra-sugary cereals. Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms and Froot Loops have all seen sales grow steeply since 2005. They have become more popular as other brands have struggled.


The largest and most mysterious resident of the debris belt between Mars and Jupiter is an icy world called Ceres, and it's on the threshold of being explored up close for the first time by NASA's Dawn mission, which is scheduled to enter Ceres' orbit on March 6.

Ceres is a small and mysterious object located between Mars and Jupiter. The icy, rocky world will soon be explored up close for the first time.


After all, Ceres is roughly the same distance from the sun as the lumpy asteroid Vesta, which is volcanic and bone dry. So how did Ceres hold onto this water when Vesta did not?

It could be that heat from inside the planet is the cause. This could be making the water rise up and explode up into blasts of water vapor. It could also simply be that ice on the surface is melting when the sun hits it. In any case, water on Ceres wouldn't ever be in liquid form. Liquid water requires a thicker atmosphere (like Earth's) to remain stable.


"We are very, very careful to ensure that we are only providing assistance to those who will not use it in ways that may affect civilians or otherwise violate international human rights standards," Alice Friend, the Pentagon's principal director for African affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.

"We've not seen anything that indicates their location at this point," Kirby said. The U.S. is sharing information with the Nigerian government. But so far, it hasn't discovered much.


U.S. officials have suggested the Nigerians must conduct the rescue in the event U.S. technology spots them.

## "Western Education Is Forbidden"


Challenger's legacy also may have lost relevance in a nation struggling now to figure out the future of human spaceflight.

"We will never forget them," Reagan said. "The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them."


"It's important to have programs like this that inspire adventure and discovery," said Laura Husband, 25, daughter of Rick Husband, commander during Columbia's ill-fated flight.

Lance Bush is the group's president. All of those Challenger Center places "have pictures of the crew on the walls," he said. When children visit, they are told about these heroes.


But after Columbia disintegrated during re-entry 17 years later, the investigator of that disaster said NASA's safety discipline was "perfect" on paper only.

Their families strongly support the Challenger Center program. 


"When you bore down a little bit deeper, you don't find any 'there' there," retired Adm. Harold Gehman said then. "There's no people, money, engineering, expertise, analysis."

"It's important to have programs like this," said Laura Husband. She is the daughter of Rick Husband, commander of Columbia's doomed 2003 flight.


Atlanta's public schools were once heralded for remarkable improvements in student achievement. They won five National Blue Ribbon Schools Awards, the federal government's highest honor, and Hall won national recognition as Superintendent of the Year in 2009.

## Climate Of Cheating


The background for potential  cheating was set in the late 1980s, when states began offering teachers and principals financial incentives to improve test scores.

## Teaching To The Test


Senior Brianna Griffin, who served as Mitchell's "big sister" — a guide and mentor — the past two years, said it wasn't totally smooth at first.

"She's very popular," said teammate Ryan Murdoch. "Everyone's always giving her hugs."


"I ... really made an effort to try to bring her into the community because a lot of the girls didn't know how to interact with her or were kind of apprehensive," she said. "But right off the bat, it was really apparent she was full of energy and excited to be on there."

"I feel the love," Kory said.


By Tuesday morning, officials had given the green light to about 35 percent of West Virginia American Water's customers. Thursday's spill affected 100,000 customers in a nine-county area, or about 300,000 people in all.

## Schools, Businesses, Restaurants Closed


But many businesses remained shuttered in outlying residential neighborhoods. Charleston attorney Anthony Majestro represents several businesses that lost money while shut down and said he has lost count of the numerous lawsuits filed over the spill.

Downtown Charleston was the first section of the city where water was declared safe. Few signs of the crisis could be seen there on Monday.


The water crisis started Thursday when a chemical used in coal processing leaked from a Freedom Industries plant into the nearby Elk River.

## 1,000 Gallons Of Free Water


No one human, that is. Wildlife populations there — shaggy-haired wild boar, long-legged elk, the howling choruses of wolves that so captivated Hinton last August — are flourishing.

## It's People Who Do The Most Damage


Though animal numbers were low when scientists first started counting them in 1987 (because no data was taken before the disaster, they can't tell to what degree the populations were hurt by the explosion), they rapidly rose once humans left the region. Brown bears and rare European lynx — predatory cats the size of a Great Dane with tufted ears and glimmering gold eyes — quickly appeared in the forests, even though they hadn't been seen for decades before the accident. Wild boar took up residence in abandoned buildings. Forests replaced humans in the villages' empty streets.

## Exclusion Zone Is Still Dangerous


But, "the environment is very resilient," Hinton said.

## A National Park Without The People


Beresford praised the Current Biology study and its findings: "People have said before that wildlife in the zone is flourishing, but those accounts were rightly criticized as anecdotal," he said. "This is the first study to really back it up with science."

Walking around the area is like being in "a national park without the people," Hinton said.


Walking around the exclusion zone is like being in "a national park without the people," Hinton said. The forests are nearly pristine, the animals abundant. What relics of human presence do remain have been almost entirely reclaimed by nature.

## A City Taken Over By Trees


According to mathematician Claude Shannon, the number of possible ways for a chess game to play out is somewhere in the region of 1 with 120 zeroes after it. That's the equivalent of a trillion multiplied by itself 10 times. There are more possible combinations of moves in any chess game than there are bacterial cells on Earth or stars in the observable universe.

## "Easy To Cheat With A Phone"


Since school ended in the spring, the city has witnessed spasms of violence such as one over the July Fourth weekend that left 14 dead and dozens injured. In one tragic incident, an 11-year-old girl inside a house at a slumber party was killed when a bullet fired outside at someone else pierced a wall and struck her in the head.

"It didn't happen, to the glory of God, and I think (very little) if anything, happened to children on their way to and from school," said Bishop Larry Trotter. He is the minister of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the city's South Side. Trotter and several other ministers urged Emanuel to keep the schools open. "The mayor and his team did a wonderful job."


"They shot my baby with a gun that's bigger than him," said his mother Shamarah Leggett. "It's out of control."

Kevin Gordon, 31, said he was talking to his cousin when he was shot in the buttocks and fell to the ground.


"Out here it's hard for a boy, no matter what you try to do with your life, no matter how you try to change … it's hard," Cade said.

"This gun violence has to stop," Leggett said. "It has to. My baby is only 3. How is he shot in the face with an army gun? Where are they getting army guns from?"


The incident appeared problematic enough for Emanuel to cancel a meeting with Obama administration Cabinet secretaries Friday and fly back to Chicago. The mayor had traveled to D.C. on Thursday to raise money for his campaign fund at an event that evening.

## Mayor Attends Prayer Gathering


"The parks in the city of Chicago belong to the families of the city of Chicago. The streets of the city of Chicago belong to the families of Chicago. The front stoops of our homes belong to the families of the city of Chicago," he told the crowd. "You go out there and you enjoy our city."

McCarthy repeatedly refused to say whether the shooting hurts the city's reputation.


"Marcus was able to smile for his high school graduation photo. And he will be wearing a big smile at his upcoming graduation ceremony at Fulton High School this summer. His dream is to enter a college culinary program and one day become a chef," Emanuel said. "Marcus — all of Chicago is smiling with you today."

For the next nine years, the mayor said, Norris was too embarrassed to smile. Then, he entered the Becoming a Man program. There, his counselor Timothy Jackson gave Norris confidence and raised money to get the student's teeth fixed.


Alderman Joe Moore said he, too, found the speech surprising, "but in a good way."

Former President Bill Clinton attended the ceremony, and more people clapped for Clinton than Emanuel when he was introduced.


Emanuel started his speech by thanking his wife, Amy Rule, and their children Zach, Ilana and Leah. He choked up as he thanked Rule and his parents. The mayor also thanked former President Bill Clinton, who attended the ceremony and drew a slightly louder ovation than Emanuel.

Instead, Emanuel tried to use his speech to make the youth the city's main problem to solve.


"He has become an issue, rather than dealing with the issue, and a distraction," Emanuel said. He added that while he is loyal to McCarthy, who he praised for his leadership of the department, the needs of the city are more important.

On Tuesday, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired the head of the Chicago Police Department. His name is Garry McCarthy.


Hundreds of thousands of times each year in the United States, children go to emergency rooms with bone fractures. But new research from the University of Maryland School of Medicine shows that the injuries are almost never splinted properly.

Almost 1 million children go to emergency rooms with broken bones every year.


As an adult, Cook was familiar with the famous Hine photo of the girl by the mill window. Studying old family snapshots, she always thought the child resembled her grandmother Blanton, who'd died when Cook was 10.

"It's so foreign to us today," said Allen.


WASHINGTON — More of the world's children are surviving to their fifth birthday, but 6.3 million still died last year, mostly from preventable causes, the U.N. children's agency said Tuesday.

WASHINGTON — Fewer children around the world are dying before age 5, the United Nations announced this week.


Importantly, there was no one formula for success. The Success Factors project examined Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Laos, Nepal, Peru, Rwanda and Vietnam, and found a variety of strategies tailored to different populations.

## Babies Get Sick Easiest


"It is not enough to know where a clinic is. You also need roads to get there," noted lead researcher Shyama Kuruvilla of the World Health Organization's Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, which coordinated the project.

"It is very, very easy to prevent those three diseases from killing kids," Chopra said. "An antibiotic is 10, 20 cents, and that saves the life basically."


The Syrian Network for Human Rights estimates there are about 5,300 child fighters among the opposition, not including extremist groups such as the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and 2,000 with pro-government forces, most between the ages of 14 and 17.

## Father And Son On Front Line


Suwaas, who fights with the Islamic Front, reasoned that it was better than having his son join one of the extremist Islamist groups.

## "You Think You're Going To Live?"


"The kid that grows up and sees a shell fall on him or on his neighbor," he said, "is going to grow up and want to fight."

All the fighters are dressed in street clothes and many wear flip-flops: They expect to spend their days not fighting, but lounging on worn sofas. They take turns watching 10 televisions that give them a view of the area around the mosque. Things have been quiet, but they can never let down their guard. After all, the government troops are waiting nearby.


As others around him chatted and smoked, 16-year-old Majid, in jeans a few sizes too small that ended inches above his ankles, stared at the TVs as if engrossed in a plotless and character-less show featuring little more than rubble, destroyed antiquities and an overturned tank.

"No," Majid said quietly.

With the rebels, he had power.

## Children Left Behind


The agency made some of the former rebel children available to tell their stories on the condition that their precise location and their full names not be used.

## When The Rebels Came


"They were firing everywhere," Charly said, his voice quavering. "I abandoned everything and ran."

"See the shoes I'm wearing?" the teenager snapped, pointing at his dusty blue flip-flops full of holes.


"I entered the Seleka to feed myself," Charly said.

"When I saw them starting to kill people, that's when I left," Charly said.


At first, he recalled, the rebels were suspicious of the lanky local boy who appeared in their midst. Then they found out he could help them. He wasn't afraid, and he knew the town.

## Forced To Be A "Wife"


"Everyone saw me carrying an AK," he said. "One day, an old woman tried to curse my grandmother. I was furious, so I shot her in the foot."

"I said, 'No, I'm still young,'" recalled the slender girl with intricately braided hair. She sat hunched on a bench, wringing her hands in her lap.


It was also a way to seek revenge against the Seleka fighter he said had killed his brother and a cousin. One day, he spotted the man. Jordy wanted to shoot him, but other rebels intervened, he said dully.

Reuniting the 78 girls freed by the Seleka with their families has been especially difficult.


"When I saw them starting to kill people, that's when I left," he said.

"With a gun," he said, "you always have money."

"For many of our economically challenged families, the meals students receive in school, including free breakfast for all students, may be the best meals they receive each day," he said.

## Far Away From Home


The 2010 quake killed more than 500 people, destroyed 220,000 homes, and washed away docks, riverfronts and seaside resorts. That quake released so much energy it shortened the Earth's day by a fraction of a second by changing the planet's rotation.

American scientist Susan Hough praised Chile. She said it is now better prepared for earthquakes than most countries are. The country's careful planning made Wednesday's earthquake much less damaging than it could have been, she said.


But for the last reluctant animal, zookeepers brought out a bag of malted milk balls.

The chimps were lured with fruit and vegetables. The zoo workers used their usual food, including carrots, celery and lettuce.


"That was the clincher," Wisthoff said.

## Malted Milk Balls


But while some visitors spent the hour enjoying animals, Brie Huffman of Raymore, Mo., was detained with two friends and many others in a food storage area. Although she grew weary of the heavy smell of animal feed, she appreciated the eight free zoo passes given to her.

While zoo workers rounded up the chimps, the Reverend Celeste Ward of Emmanuel Repentance Temple of Kansas City, was locked in the birdcage. She was visiting with family members. Zoo workers politely explained the emergency, she said. The workers gave them several free zoo tickets.


"They are good until Dec. 31," said Huffman. "I will be using all of them."
Zoo visitor Mari Cintron was visiting the penguins when the chimps escaped. She kept three children entertained while they were locked in.


"Full protection under the Endangered Species Act is long overdue for chimpanzees, our closest living relatives," Pippin said. "The new status is a tremendous change that ends the completely unprotected current status of captive chimpanzees."

## Used In AIDs Research


Investigating whether chimps might be able to adopt vocalization from other bands has been difficult. Chimp groups don't suddenly merge in the wild. In fact, they're far more likely to go to war with each other, research shows.

"There is no difference, at least in chimpanzees," Townsend said.


So when seven chimpanzees from the Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were slated to be transferred to the Edinburgh Zoo, which already had six chimps, researchers at the University of York, St. Andrews and Zurich took advantage.

## Chimp Groups Don't Like To Join Others


The Netherlands chimps also did not appear to have changed the intensity of their food preference — they still were more inclined than their Scottish counterparts to choose apples over other foods, according to the study.

## The Call For "Apple" Changed Over Time


The researchers lean toward the latter explanation — the chimpanzees were driven by the need to get along.

Scientists do not know the reason why.


"The slow pace of social integration reported suggests that these calls are really about affiliation and not about semantics," Snowdon said.

Simon Kirby is at the University of Edinburgh. He called it "the first hint" that language can be learned by apes.


Still, she added, China needs to improve its legal protections for animals, noting that the country lacks legislation to shield "companion animals" such as dogs and cats from abuse, abduction and killing. "There is no law to protect them," she said.

Xie Pingxiang, a local historian, said that eating dog meat goes way back. "It doesn't break the law and has nothing to do with morality either," he said.


Still, he said, the key is "to try to convince people not to eat dog meat, because that will reduce demand."

"The online response has been terrific," she said. "In the past, this kind of outrage usually came from supporters overseas. But now momentum is growing inside China."


She and others, though, might be heartened by later reports on the dolphin incident.

Some people said the efforts to put down the dog-meat festival might backfire.


For the time being, more passengers have meant more delays and frustration. A new genre of cellphone video on YouTube shows airport brawls in which stools become projectiles and irate passengers smash telephones and computers.

Xu said it would be very difficult to take away airspace from the military. Probably only President Xi Jinping could do it.


Certainly the stock markets are anticipating the pitter-patter of little consumer feet. On Monday, the first trading day since the announcement Friday night, shares of toy, milk powder and baby goods manufacturers were up sharply. Hailun Piano Co., whose instruments are used by the progeny of Chinese "tiger moms," saw its shares rise 9.98 percent both Monday and Tuesday, before it hit the Shenzhen Stock Exchange's limit of a 10 percent change in price a day.

## Big Baby Boom Not Expected


Zhao Mei, 30, who has a 15-month-old daughter, said she and her husband had been planning to have a second child all along but were figuring they would have to save up the money to pay the fines, which run up to $50,000.

"I am so busy with one child. I can't imagine taking care of two children," said Feng Zhilan, 32, as she came out of a Beijing children's hospital with her son. "And I'm spending about $490 to $655 a month on him for kindergarten, clothes, activities. It is not possible."


"There's no nationwide timetable for the implementation of the new second-baby policy. Each province, city or district should make a specific timetable based on local conditions," Wang Peian, vice minister of the National Health and Family Planning Commission, was quoted as telling the official New China News Agency over the weekend.

"I feel we could have provided her with a better life. That is a regret I hope we will make up (for) in the future," said Zhang. The one-child law, he said, had to be changed for the good of China.


"You don't have to play well to enjoy it," he said, after entertaining a small crowd. Jiang said he was happier now that he could see his daughter daily, but he admitted that he misses his home to the north, where his family lived for many years.

## A Yearly Visit


The brand-new four-story center stands as an anomaly in its old neighborhood, supported by a vast network of private and corporate donors. While its top floors shine with modernity, its bottom floor, smelling like a toilet, is a reminder of the challenges ahead for China's elderly.

"We have nothing to do at home," Wang said, while busily knitting under a large tree.


Pollution is the dark side of China's economic juggernaut. Industrial contaminants have fouled about one-fifth of China's arable farmland. The World Health Organization says air pollution levels in Beijing are 40 times higher than deemed safe to breathe. Dangerous levels of heavy metals keep showing up in China's rice. Three-fourths of the nation's lakes and rivers are severely polluted, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

In China, there is no freedom to gather in public. Many people feel helpless in confronting these larger problems. Yet more of them are gathering in the streets. These people protest new projects in their communities they feel are threatening.


This year, the government has turned party pooper, railing against excessive gift-giving.

## Communist Party Poopers


The new standards on gift-giving are part of an overall austerity campaign launched by Xi Jinping since he stepped up to the presidency in March. The crackdown started in earnest last month with the beginning of the holiday season, which got underway with the Sept. 19 Mid-Autumn Festival and will conclude with the Lunar New Year at the end of January.

"Gift-giving is a must, but you should avoid extravagance," advised the official state paper, the People's Daily. Gifts of luxury brands, wine, expensive cigarette and large amounts of cash were all warned against.


Parents are also expected to ante up a gift on Teachers' Day, a public holiday in China on Sept. 10, to help ensure that their children get good grades.

For the Mid-Autumn Festival, businessmen give each other hockey-puck-shaped mooncakes. These sometimes cost as much as $200 per box.


Activist Luo, who comes from a small northeastern city in Jilin province, said that his family paid 100,000 yuan — about $16,000 — in cash under the table at a public hospital two years ago when his grandfather was having surgery for colon cancer, although the medical care was nominally covered by his insurance.

Or a $3 million villa on the French Riviera. That's what former government official Bo Xilai got. Bo was recently sentenced to life in prison for accepting illegal payments favors.


Two years ago, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference submitted a proposal to extend the heat southward. And a writer for the Communist-run newspaper Global Times last year reiterated the call.

## It Feels Even Colder


According to Xiao, it was Orville Schell, a China specialist who then was dean of the UC Berkeley School of Journalism, who convinced him to come west to teach. Their collaboration led to the founding of China Digital Times.

For Xiao, changes in China's government cannot happen soon enough. The Chinese government forbids him from returning to China, even to visit his family.


On May 29, China destroyed nearly 1,500 pounds of tusks and ivory carvings in a public ceremony in Beijing, after similar events in southern China and Hong Kong last year.

## Chinese Government Praised By Several Groups


But Meng said China should not be the only country to act.

The United States is the world's second-largest market for illegal wildlife products. People in the U.S. are still allowed to buy and sell ivory harvested before 1989. That was the year a worldwide ban went into effect. Hunters can also bring ivory into the United States as long as they do not sell it.


Since 2006, China's Culture Ministry has devoted $3.5 billion yuan, about $574 million, to programs seeking to preserve the nation's "intangible cultural heritage." But late last month, the ministry announced it was disqualifying 300 of those programs, either because they were ineffective or couldn't account for expended funds, according to a story in the China Daily.

## Art Faded Into The Background


In Weifang, a city of 9 million people in China's Shandong province, kites have been part of the city's DNA for centuries. Numerous books credit Lu Ban, an inventor from Weifang, for popularizing the construction of kites in the fourth century B.C. Today, Weifang is home to an annual international kite festival, an 86,000-square-foot kite museum and more than 100 factories that mass-produce kites, partly for export to other countries.

The slow downfall of kite making is part of a larger story in China. Historic buildings, crafts and music are being erased by China's growth. The country is not able to keep its older way of life.


"More than 80 percent of the technologies adopted in the mission are new," Wu Zhijian, spokesman with the State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, told the news service last week.

## A Waning Moon?


"Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!" he exclaimed, pointing at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the local promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do.

## Instrumental Problem Solved


But as they say in Hollywood, the show must go on, and so it did. (Nolan got his new drum heads 20 minutes before the curtain went up for the show, called "Classic Oscar: The American Hollywood Film Orchestra New Year's Audio-Visual Concert.")

On this Saturday evening in Beijing, two cello players opened the cases of the instruments they were borrowing. They found one of them too damaged to play, its bridge was broken. Nearby, percussionist Chris Nolan had his own problems and was furious.


At 7:30 p.m., conductor Jason Altieri took to the podium, raised his baton and launched the group into Berlioz's "Rakoczi March." Its ostensible Oscar connection? Well, there was none, but the song was included in the 1966 French film "La Grande Vadrouille," which, judging from the accompanying clips on a giant screen at the rear of the stage, was a slapstick comedy with lots of Nazis.

"Nicest hall in China and they give me the crappiest drum kit!" he exclaimed. He pointed at the pitted and sagging drum heads. Stagehands with walkie-talkies, an interpreter and the promoter buzzed around the stage, trying to figure out what to do.


Some performers are recent college grads, others are senior citizens like Jack Cobos, a retired carpet salesman and former violinist with the Chattanooga Symphony who's turning 71 during this tour. Though they're hardly celebrities, the musicians say that in smaller cities, they've been swarmed by crowds eager to take dozens of pictures after their shows.

## Playing Concert Halls Under Construction


"When we got there to rehearse the day before, they were still building the bathrooms," said Jason Heidelberg, a cellist from Cleveland. "On the day of the show, the bathrooms were finished, but the floor was still not done — they just put red carpet over it."

Conductor Altieri recalled being in an area of China called Ningbo. The group stumbled across a music school where an old man was teaching children the erhu, a traditional Chinese two-stringed instrument. The Americans watched for half an hour. The kids staged an unplanned concert. Later, the Americans found a group of people performing karaoke in a park, and joined in.


In May of 2014, 43 people died and more than 90 people were injured when five men in two SUVs crashed their vehicles into a crowd on a Urumqi shopping street, throwing bombs out their windows.

Jin Xiaolong helped start a group in Urumqi six years ago. The group now has 25 members. Many started as teenagers, learning about parkour from Internet videos.


Chen noted that based on other studies of how much economic growth Chinese citizens would be willing to give up to prolong their lives, he can conclude that the public would be willing to forgo up to 2 percentage points of economic growth to reduce particulates by 100 micrograms per cubic meter.

## Trading Health For Money


The app is part of an ambitious effort by environmentalists to use data and social media to use the power of public opinion in a country that lacks other routes to social change, such as elections or an independent judiciary.

## Smoggy Skies


A study published last year by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences indicated that air pollution, primarily from coal burned for heat and electricity, reduces the average life span of the 500 million residents of northern China by 5 1/2 years, compared with those living in the somewhat less polluted southern part of the country where the government does not supply steam heat in the winter.

China is not a democracy. There are no elections, and courts are controlled by the government. In a democracy, elections and courts help people influence their government to make changes. In China, lots of people must pressure the government to make changes. Showing pollution on the app can encourage people to pressure officials to crack down on polluters, Ma said.


Senior Chinese economic officials say the country also will have to close down its oldest, dirtiest and least efficient heavy-industrial facilities, such as steel mills and cement factories, where China has far more production capacity than it needs.

## Turning Gray Skies Blue?


Wan Zongyi is a tall, lanky 17-year-old who says he thinks teachers favor girls and that many of his friends have come to resent their female counterparts as well as school.

## Boxing And Military Boot Camp


"This has weakened their ability to live independently," Lu said. "And also weakened their ability to make choices themselves. Their capabilities are weakened by their families."

"I think Chinese women, especially young women in cities, some of them share this kind of preference," said Song Geng who teaches at the University of Hong Kong.


These experts also single out an online literary genre of romance stories about gay men that's popular among some women, arguing that it adds to mixed messages for boys.

More men in China are buying beauty products, even makeup.


"Now on campus, the boys who look more girly are more popular," said Wan, the student. "I think it is a trend."

But now, Louis said, things are moving back toward a broader idea of what makes a man a man. "There is a traditional background in the Chinese case, which makes the revival easier," he said.


"This is very important for planning other missions, like one to Mercury, which could use a lander just like this one," said G. Jeffrey Taylor, a researcher at the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology. "Once you get down to minus 80 or 90, the electronics may not survive. They must be in containers with little radioactive heating units to keep things up to a certain temperature so they don't get damaged."

"The parts of the moon that have been explored are so minuscule," said former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao. "It's like saying you sent probes to the Earth, you looked at small areas of California and New York, and now you know everything there is to know. That's not the case."


One is a popular Listserv group for lunar scientists; just hours after the Dec. 14 landing, Dr. Zheng Yongchun of the National Astronomical Observatories of China posted a message to the group, saying the rover and the lander had taken pictures of each other.

## Manned Moon Mission Next?


"The Chinese textile industry has been undergoing great changes and restructuring," said Yingjiao Xu, associate professor at the College of Textiles at N.C. State University. She said Chinese textile companies are looking to start manufacturing in other parts of China and other countries to save on overhead expenses.

Doug Woodward, an economics professor at the University of South Carolina, described the incoming Chinese companies' spending as "small tiptoes into the U.S. for these big companies."


BGI, a company based in the southern city of Shenzhen that is known for its work sequencing human, plant and animal DNA, recently announced that it intends to start selling $1,600 miniature pigs that it initially created as laboratory models for studying human ailments.

## Scientists "Edit" Pig Genes


Researchers say the creation of micro pigs could be a boon for scientists, cutting down on the cost of raising them as laboratory animals and making their care more manageable. "Their utility for research will depend on whether they are otherwise normal like a regular pig and unaffected by the edited gene other than their diminutive size," said Willard Eyestone, an associate professor of biotechnology at Virginia Tech.

Alison Van Eenennaam visited BGI about three months ago and saw the micro pigs. She is an expert at the University of California, Davis.


But Alison Van Eenennaam, a biotechnology specialist at the University of California, Davis who visited BGI about three months ago and saw their micro pigs, said the fact that the company has resorted to marketing them as pets reflects the "global regulatory gridlock" around gene-edited animals for food production and other more serious purposes.

## Friends, Not Food


"Genome editing is a powerful technology that can be used for many beneficial applications … such as producing disease-resistant animals and other things that would have real benefits for the sustainability of food production," she said. But worldwide, she said, no genetically engineered animal for food production has been able to be brought to market, and only a few genetically engineered animal therapeutic products have been approved for humans. That, she believes, is making companies hesitant to invest in the technology.

People accept bioengineered pets much easier. A florescent fish, called GloFish, is popular in the United States. The fish were created by Singaporean scientists. They inserted jellyfish and sea anemone genes into zebrafish eggs.


Chinese society has long been worried about the post-'80s and what will become of them. They've been called spoiled, irresponsible, materialistic, lazy and confused. "They are described as China's lost generation," said Minna Jia, who researched the age group while obtaining her doctorate at the University of Southern California. "People say this generation only cares about money, about themselves."

Most Chinese people were poor, but so were their neighbors. They all lived in a similar way. But China began to give up this system and allowed for more people to own businesses and property. Soon people became more interested in shopping and owning things. A gap began to grow between the haves and have-nots.


"We have four elderly people to take care of and one child to raise. Our children have no access to safe milk or fair education. High real estate prices make us homeless," said one comment on Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter. "We want to look up into the starry sky, but who has clouded it?"

Zhu Dake, an outspoken cultural critic and professor at Shanghai's Tongji University, said the Tiananmen crackdown had crushed hopes for democracy, freedom and justice while stricter ideological education and the rapid expansion of free market reforms replaced it with a cynical outlook.

"They very much support the government in many ways," said Liu Fengshu, the author of a book on China's youth and modern society. "I think people will protest if the situation really goes beyond their tolerance level, but it is very hard now to say how much young people can bear."

Zhang, the tour guide, said in an interview with Xinhua from his hospital bed that he grabbed a life jacket with seconds to spare as the ship listed in the storm, sending bottles rolling off tables, and suddenly turned all the way over.

The captain and engineer said the boat tipped over quickly after being caught in a cyclone, which is like a hurricane. A Chinese newspaper said the ship overturned within two minutes in the river, which was 50 feet deep in that area.


"The raindrops hitting my face felt like hailstones," he said. "'Just hang in there a little longer,' I told myself," he added.

Zhang said he cannot swim. He drifted in the river all night and reached the shore just before dawn.


Chinese Premier Li Keqiang traveled to the accident site about 110 miles west of the Hubei provincial capital of Wuhan.

Huang Yan, 49, an accountant in Shanghai, wept as she told a reporter that she believes that her husband, 49, and his father, who is in his 70s, were aboard. But she said she couldn't be sure because she hadn't seen a passenger manifest yet.

"Why did the captain leave the ship while the passengers were still missing?" Huang shouted. "We want the government to release the name list to see who was on the boat."


Another OCA activist is Ted Gong, a retired State Department employee who helped set up the 1882 Foundation to educate people about the Chinese Exclusion Act.

Fung set up what may have been the first Chinese restaurant in the Pittsburgh region, the Bellevue Tea Garden. The restaurant operated from 1926 to 1997, said his daughter, Karen Yee.


While the exclusion act barred "skilled and unskilled laborers and Chinese employed in mining" from entering the U.S., the treaty provisions that allowed merchants and some others into the country meant the law was "essentially fraudulent," Daniels said, because it "really just ended immigration of Chinese laborers."

## "Going To Marry Him"


Neither family favored the union. When Fung asked his grandfather to send a family heirloom jade ring for the engagement, he refused. And Kristoff's brother threatened Fung with violence.

"She said she knew two weeks after she met him that she was going to marry him," Yee said.


But they went ahead after Fung, who followed Confucian teachings, agreed to let the children be raised Catholic.

Neither family favored the union, and Kristoff's brother threatened to hurt Fung.

"Because there's so much money that can be made, and because there's a lack of regulation, you're just going to see a lot of people rushing into this field driven by profit rather than the desire to provide students and schools with a quality experience," said Jay Chen, president of the Hacienda La Puente Unified school board.

"I have people saying, 'I can get you 100 students right now.' No, I don't want 100 students," Dorsey said. "I want to see that this is a great place to study and a good experience for kids when they come over."


"In many of our communities, the enrollment is down, and the facility and the staff could accommodate more students," said Reggie Felton, assistant executive director for congressional relations at the National School Boards Association, which supports the bill.

"There's so much money that can be made," said Jay Chen. He is president of a local school board. He says because there aren't a lot of rules, companies may be "driven by profit rather than the desire to provide students and schools with a quality experience."


Xu and Li are part of a group of 129 newly arrived teachers from China in the largest Chinese guest-teacher program, supported by the College Board and the Confucius Institute Headquarters/Hanban, a public institution affiliated with China's Ministry of Education that promotes the study of Chinese language and culture.

Xu, 30, grew up, went to a university and teaches high school English in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province in north-central China. He plans to return there after the school year to rejoin his wife and 7-month-old son.

Li, 31, has been teaching high school English for seven years in eastern China. She said she already liked Florida because it reminded her of Qingdao, her hometown. "I love sunshine, the beach and the sea," she said.


"Ideally, we would transition to hiring teachers from the States, but there's a shortage," center spokeswoman Stephanie Caplan said.

## Fun With Feng Shui


Lately, the women are striking back. Last fall, China's State Council proposed the nation's toughest restrictions yet on indoor smoking and the marketing of tobacco. The announcement was a major victory for China's tobacco-control movement, which includes several women who've been on the front lines for decades.

Smoking is so common in China that the country is known as the Smoking Dragon. However, women smoke far less then men do. In 2010, about 288 million Chinese men smoked regularly, while only 13 million women did.


China's anti-smoking movement includes many prominent men. Former NBA center Yao Ming and other celebrities have lent their names to the cause. An activist named Li Enze filed a lawsuit in 2013 against China's tobacco monopoly, alleging that it had fraudulently marketed a low-tar cigarette brand called Black Tiger.

Women have been very important in efforts to control smoking. They have been pushing the government to make new rules that will limit smoking in public.


As Pratt noted, the battle is far from won. Although smoking rates have declined in recent years, more than half of Chinese men smoke regularly, according to the WHO. Some 700 million Chinese — twice the population of the United States — are routinely exposed to secondhand smoke, which kills an estimated 100,000 people annually.

## Uncool For Women To Smoke


Yang, who formerly worked in China's version of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, became interested in smoking-related diseases and other preventable illnesses while attending medical school in Chengdu in the early 1980s. Early in her career, she studied at Harvard School of Public Health and worked on health projects for the World Bank and the World Health Organization. Because of her WHO experience, she became part of the Chinese delegation that worked on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which China ratified in 2005.

Xu Guihua is a member of the Chinese Association on Tobacco Control. She said the new rules would only work if everyone helps out, since police cannot be everywhere. For that to happen, Chinese ideas about smoking will have to change.


This could be helpful to the Chinooks, since the nation has more documentation from the modern era that goes beyond its oral history, Elliott said, and it will help "level the playing field" for all tribes seeking recognition.

## Recognized, Then Not, Wait What?


For years, chocolate lovers have remained blissfully unaware of the precise reason bittersweet dark chocolate seems to improve cardiovascular health. At least until now, that is.

For years, chocolate lovers have taken comfort in a pleasing fact: Chocolate can be good for you. It's long been known that bittersweet dark chocolate improves cardiovascular health. The tasty treat helps the heart and blood vessels.


The molecules are too large to cross the walls of the gut and be used as nutrients, according to researcher John Finley, a professor of food science and biochemistry at Louisiana State University.

## "Down The GI Tract"


"These little guys say, 'Hey — there's something in there that I can use,' and they start to break it down," Finley said.

The polyphenolic polymer molecules are too large to cross the walls of the gut, says scientist John Finley. Thus they can't be absorbed into the rest of the body as nutrients. Nutrients provide nourishment and food for the body. They are what keeps our body's motor running.


A number of short-term studies conducted in recent years have suggested that dark chocolate can cause blood vessels to dilate, and thus lower blood pressure, although this is not the case with white chocolate and milk chocolate.

Many churches and religious organizations sponsor Boy Scout troops, but basically provide meeting spaces for the organizations. Trail Life troops will be part of the ministry of the churches that charter them.

Boys of any race and religion can join Trail Life, same as the Boy Scouts. But all adult leaders must be Christian — no Jews, no Muslims, no Buddhists. The BSA opens its leadership to adults of all faiths.


"Twenty-five percent of younger boys experience some sense of gender confusion or sexuality fluidity and we will help guide him in a way that affirms his God-given physical biology," said Trail Life board chairman John Stemberger, an Orlando attorney and Eagle Scout who fought the inclusion of gay scouts.

## Will Ban Openly Gay Scouts


To Collier, Trail Life represents a return to what the Boy Scouts once were before they compromised their values to reflect a changing society.

Stemberger's OnMyHonor.net gave birth to Trail Life. He argues that Trail Life isn't an imitation of the Boy Scouts — it's better.


So far, there's no sign of a mass defection of Boy Scouts to Trail Life.

What is happening with the Boy Scouts now is what happened to the Girl Scouts of America in 1995, Stermberger says. That's when they started accepting lesbian girls. That decision led to the founding of American Heritage Girls. It now has more than 20,000 members, compared with 2.3 million Girl Scouts.


The Central Florida Council of Boy Scouts says only three churches have withdrawn their sponsorship of Scout troops. Since the decision was announced in May, the seven-county district has added 2,000 new families, and expects to attract 6,500 by the end of October, said Bill Gosselin, director of operations.

So far, there's no sign of a mass stream of Boy Scouts to Trail Life.


"Ninety-nine percent of our units are happily still with us," Perez said. "We are trying to serve all of America, and we believe that we're are doing it successfully."

"This year we are on pace to have more growth than last year," Bill Gosselin said. He is head of operations for BSA.


It doesn't matter to Collier of Windermere how many boys join Trail Life or how many troops the organization has or how big Trail Life becomes. He's excited to be part of building something he believes in, instead of remaining with an organization in which he is disillusioned.

Not even 1 percent of Boy Scouts have left since the rules change, according to Tico Perez. He is the BSA National Commissioner.


"It is like coming home," he said. "When the BSA did that in May, you lost your home."
"Ninety-nine percent of our units are happily still with us," Perez said. "We are trying to serve all of America, and we believe that we're are doing it successfully."


Christians, who make up an estimated 10 percent of Egypt's 92 million population, have never had an easy time existing in Egypt, caught precariously for 80 years between a generally secular Egyptian state and Islamists who see Christians as heretics who threaten their vision of an Islamic Egypt.

The wave of attacks on churches sparked anger in the weeks just after Morsi left power. Now, both Christian and Muslim Egyptians are completely silent. Yet the attacks continue across the country.


It is the kind of analysis repeated over and over among Egyptians, a fear that pushing back against an increasingly authoritarian government could somehow lead to something they believe is worse: A return of the Islamists.

## Christians Prefer Military Rule For Now


"There was a national solidarity unifying Christians and Muslims against the horrible damage inflicted by the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsi," said Youssef Sidhom, the editor-in-chief of Watani, Egypt's biggest Christian newspaper, which his father founded.

Ishak Ibrahim is an Egyptian Christian. He thinks that Christians want to live under a strict, army government instead of a government controlled by Muslims who want everyone in Egypt to be Muslim. "The choice before people is freedom or the right to live," Ibrahim said.


Amid such fears, there is little pressure on the government to do more for Christians. The police claim they didn't have enough forces to protect the roughly 2,000 churches nationwide, particularly as their police stations were also set ablaze during the outbreak of violence after Morsi's ouster.

But now Morsi is gone, and Sidhom thinks that the Christians are "terrified to speak" after the attacks on their churches.


"The state can say, 'Look at what the Brotherhood is doing,' " said Ahmed Ragab, a legal researcher for The Egyptian Center for Public Policy Studies, who conducted a study of the destruction of churches and visited five cities where such attacks happened. "The state does not see it as a sectarian problem. It is a security problem."

The officer said that the police have bigger battles to fight. The officers first want to find out who destroyed their stations and capture members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood.


Morgan asked Christie if homosexuality is a sin and the governor, who is Catholic, responded that his religion says it is.

Christie did not answer questions when asked about the bill signing at an event on Monday morning. He told reporters to read his written statement.


Until Monday, Christie has mostly earned only criticism from gay advocates. He vetoed a bill last year that would have allowed same-sex marriage in New Jersey, and he insists that the measure should be put to the voters instead. His opponents argue that same-sex marriage is a civil right, and such rights should not be decided by popular vote.
A group that supports gay rights issued a statement Monday praising Christie's decision to sign the bill.


Hours earlier, Christie spoke by phone with donors, friends and out-of-state supporters. "The idea of going back to where you were when you were 15, or 16, or 17 years old, and to be able to stand in front of that group of people and offer yourself to the presidency is a really, really amazing moment," Christie told them.

## First Things First


The governor, who throughout his career has joked about his weight on television, in social media and before countless audiences, said it was his plan all along never to acknowledge publicly that he had undergone gastric band surgery, more commonly known as lap band surgery.

## Cards Replace Tokens


As she kept a watchful eye on just-turned 5-year-old Annabelle and big sister Gracie, 8, Brandie Bohmer noted that bolder flavors might come in handy during birthday parties, when the restaurant hosts a mix of adults.

That's a scary thought for Bohmer.


Bohmer is a mom of four and said she has at least two birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese's annually.

"Because this is for younger kids, I say no," Bohmer said. "If they lose one token, I'm not going to cry over that. If they lose a card with 100 tokens, I'm going to cry."


The bugs have their fans. They include Greg Plowman of Manhattan, who, using the guilt trip of Father's Day, lured his wife and son and son's friend to the cicada walk on Staten Island. Plowman, a scientist, has a dead cicada in the bug collection in his study, but he's enamored of the live ones too.

The pilgrims thought that cicadas were locusts, like from the plague in the Bible. The American poet Thoreau wrote about them in a letter to his mother. People passing Staten Island on tall ships in the 19th century could hear their mating calls.


Indeed, the cicada's odd span can invoke questions about the meaning of life in even the most unreflective of humans.

"It's not worth it," Max says of the life of a the insect. "They exist to turn tree sap into noise."

SEATTLE  — A small but growing number of parents are bucking a trend when it comes to raising their kids: Rather than move to suburbs as their parents once did, many are opting to stay in or near downtown.

SEATTLE  — Usually, families with kids will move from the city center to the suburbs. In the suburbs, they can find peace and quiet, more space and good schools.


The city is increasing its share of kids under 15 at a time when that percentage is declining elsewhere.

For decades, Seattle has had a reputation as a city without children. In the 1960s and 1970s, families moved to the suburbs. The number of children dropped.


"We drank the Kool-Aid. We thought once we got married, we had to buy a house in the suburbs," said Aaron Whitney, 40, a technology consultant.

The partners think they have a solution for cash-poor municipalities in the United States — short streetcar loops to revitalize downtown cores.

"It's like a jungle in there," said Brad Read. He is 61 years old and is the president of the company. "And when we go to buy them, the owner has to go in with a chain saw and cut down the trees just to get them out."


The cost of putting in track including an overhead wire is at least $10 million to $20 million a mile, depending on local costs, Read said.

In the months after the outrage stirred by the deaths of Brown and another unarmed African-American, Eric Garner, in New York, singer D'Angelo released his first album in more than a decade, "Black Messiah," which included references both glancing and startlingly direct to the chain of events between Selma and Ferguson. "All we wanted was a chance to talk," he sings in "Charade, " 'stead we only got outlined in chalk."

"The movement is a rhythm to us, freedom is like religion to us," Common raps. Then he mentions the '50s civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. He connects Parks with last year's protests in Ferguson, Missouri. Those protests started after a police officer killed an unarmed African-American teenager. His name was Michael Brown.


Pops bore witness until his last days, as his final recording attests. "Don't Lose This" (Anti-), released this week, was recorded with his children in the years before his death in 2000.

After the war, "Ten Cent" raised money for Confederate veterans and stayed by his former master's side as he lived out his final years in the Confederate Soldiers' Home in Atlanta. When he died in 1933, "Ten Cent" became the first and only African-American to lie in the Confederate Cemetery in Marietta.

Several miles away, "Ten Cent" Bill Yopp was trying to find his place in the world. He was born a slave. During the war he was a Confederate drummer, shining boots for a living and tending to the wounds of his master, Captain Thomas McCall Yopp.


Stone Mountain Memorial Association CEO Bill Stephens said the museum is now the priority. If it is indeed built, it would be only the second museum of its kind in the United States.

## No Black Confederate Soldiers?


Which stories to tell will be the challenge for the museum's curators. As convoluted as Civil War history can be, the story of the black soldier is even more complicated.

Service records kept by the National Park Service showed that all black soldiers who served in the Civil War fought for the North. There is no evidence that slaves fought for the Confederacy.


Take this argument from several weeks ago: A group of Confederate flag supporters marched on Stone Mountain to protest plans for the King memorial, arguing that because the civil rights leader had no involvement in the Civil War, he had no place on Stone Mountain, which is a Confederate memorial.

## Historian Can't Find Any


Despite arguments to the contrary, there is no documented evidence that blacks — former slaves — fought on the side of the Confederacy.

## "A Slave Cannot Volunteer"


"So there was a push to counter that by looking for their own Confederate soldiers," Levin said. "If you can find black men, you can defuse the talk of emancipation. … It is a myth that lives on the Internet, but there is no reputable scholar who supports this myth."

"By November of 1864, the Confederacy was faced with the decision. 'Do we want to win the war or protect slavery,'" Thurmond said. "They picked slavery."


But the true story of "Ten Cent" — who Levin said is on a short list of former servants who have been transformed into loyal Confederates — is more in line with what the black role was for the Confederacy.

Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, freeing slaves in the South. After, about 200,000 blacks decided to fight for the Union.


"The Confederate government used slaves to free up as many white men to fight on the lines," Levin said. "Many of these (black) men were in uniform, so when you see photos many confuse them as evidence that they were soldiers. But they were not."

Thurmond said, "The war ended before black Confederate soldiers could be deployed. It was over and there is no record of this. No official records show black soldiers in the Confederacy."

"We talked about doing an actual battle, but the problem is when you do that some expert will come up and say, well the fence is in the wrong place," said Herdegen, whose latest book, "The Iron Brigade in Civil War and Memory: The Black Hats from Bull Run to Appomattox and Thereafter," was published last year.

"We had a lot of cannon explosions," Noll said. As they were going across the field, fire, explosions and smoke were set off. "Everything was staked out with flags so people wouldn't step on them."


Project STAR (Student Teacher Achievement Ratio) was conducted in Tennessee from 1985 to 1989 and involved more than 1,200 teachers and almost 12,000 students, according to Jeremy Finn, of the University at Buffalo (State University of New York), a statistician who helped set up the experiment and publish its results.

## What Happened In California?


That's the kind of talk Courtney Hollenbeck has hoped to hear since she founded her first music program at Winterfield in 2007. (She has taught there for 11 years.) She was using a violin in second-grade science class to illustrate concepts of pitch and volume when a student said, "It sounds like angels." That inspired her to start the rudiments of an orchestra. By the 2009-10 school year, she had personally bought 30 violins for beginners and asked the symphony for help.

"When drinking bad water sometimes children can die, so I worry because (my children could) suffer," Petronella told Derek Watson, director of the film "This Is Normal", which chronicles the worldwide water crisis.

There is plenty of water in the world, but not a lot to drink. More than two-thirds of the Earth is covered in water. Almost of all that water is salt water. People need fresh water. Most of the planet's fresh-water supply is frozen in ice caps. What is left is the water stored underground.


Changes are already evident in the city, where new construction is booming. Hammers and drills sound at all hours on the Flats East Bank, a onetime hip area that fell into disarray a decade ago and is experiencing a renaissance. Downtown, a new convention center just opened, and developers are rushing to build hotels and luxury condos to keep up with demand. Ohio's first casino opened downtown in 2012. And restaurateurs are following in the steps of Cleveland native and James Beard Award winner Michael Symon, opening bistros where you can get entrees such as frog legs and rabbit pie with Parmesan and prosciutto crust.

Friends in her hometown of New York City all reacted the same.


When LeBron defected in 2010, the city had gone through a rough few years. Northeast Ohio suffered as the rest of the country did during the recession, and the unemployment rate peaked at 9.3 percent in August 2009. In 2008, the FBI and Internal Revenue Service raided offices of a Cuyahoga County commissioner, triggering a corruption investigation that would lead to a salacious trial and the conviction of the commissioner on racketeering and corruption charges.

"It's still same old, same old here," said Vickie Williams. She works downtown and has seen the changes there. Still, she says that no boom has trickled into her neighborhood. People there still beg for money outside the Dollar General store and tall weeds grow in empty lots where houses once stood.


"The first inclination that college-age kids in Cleveland used to have was to flee," said Adam Fishman, a principal with Fairmount Properties, which is developing the Flats. "Somehow that has now changed."

## Leaving To Come Home Again


Of course, the potential prowess of the city's sports teams doesn't hurt. On a recent weeknight, Matt and Jess Weisenburger were clustered with some friends around a truck where T-shirts were being sold that said "Forgiven," followed by "The Kingdom Restored." Priced at $20 apiece, the shirts sold out the day James announced his decision.

On a road trip from Alaska to New York, Quarto and her partner, Gail L. Palmer, stopped in Cleveland and intended to stay three days. They stayed for 10. It wasn't long before they decided to try living here.


Cleveland has paid a total of $3 million to the families of the victims in the 2012 shooting, Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams, to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit.

The four officers would not say anything about how Henderson got hurt. None of them got in trouble. Henderson spent three years in prison. Later, he won a lawsuit against the city of Cleveland. The city had to pay him $600,000.


So while we may not know exactly what's happening in Arica, Chile — or whether it should be attributed to human-caused global warming — the fact is that damage to historical artifacts and world heritage sites is an expected consequence of climate change in general. And how could it be otherwise? Many of these sites have been remarkably preserved precisely because of the fact that they have been climatically unperturbed.

John Dee, who has been surfing in and around the bay for 20 years, is concerned about losing the area's low-tide corridors.

"We'll roll with it," said Pete Ogilvie, a Monterey Bay surfer for more than 30 years. He is facing the possible changes with a laid-back Surf City vibe.


El Niño conditions bring warm and high waters to the Pacific coast, rolling out a red carpet for strong storms, waves and winds to slam California directly from the southwest. That could improve surf conditions to the Monterey Bay, at least temporarily.

"As the temperature rises, especially in the Arctic, the big winter storms are moving farther north," Storlazzi said. So, areas along California could see fewer waves.


Surfing "is a very experiential or 'now' activity," Ogilvie said. "When waves die in one spot and pick up in another, you move to that spot."
"(The El Niño waves) hammer the shoreline," Storlazzi said. "They're the biggest and best waves."


"There is a need for all scientists to rise to this challenge," she wrote.
Hsiang and the other researchers make no attempt to establish a clear cause. They say there might be a physical link between heat and acting on anger. But they are not biologists. What they want is for their work to cause more research and planning in the face of global warming.


At a going-away party for Praeli in Washington this summer, some colleagues ribbed her for joining forces with a politician.

Another avenue for back-to-school specials could open in the summer of 2017 if there's a lockout, as widely expected. Udoh, the Clippers' backup center, used the last work stoppage in 2011 to complete the final semester toward his degree in general studies from Baylor.

Point guard Nate Robinson needs to finish one more year of coursework to get his degree. He is studying acting at school and has been in several ads for Pepsi already. A college degree in acting may get him more work as an actor, he said.


The group favors an approach that wafts tiny aerosolized water droplets into the atmosphere, creating a natural mirror that increases clouds' reflectivity.

None of the men in the group will be alive by the end of this century. By then temperatures are likely to be so high they will harm ecosystems and human health.


"Clouds have one of the biggest impacts on global temperature. But they're one of the most poorly understood parts of the atmospheric system," Wanser said. "There's never been a way to do a controlled study of aerosols and clouds. Their interaction is a big mystery."

"We would be perfectly happy if our method works beautifully and it never needs to be used, " said Cooper.

Audrey got an offer to join Chantilly that night and three more from other teams she tried out for. She selected the Juniors and signed a contract with the team — something common among youth travel teams today.

The coach told Audrey she was not ready to be a setter on the team and would not play much for the rest of the season, even though she had college-level skills. The family was disappointed and confused. They felt they had not been given what they were promised after paying a lot of money.

Batey also met her future husband at Bletchley Park. She and Keith Batey, a mathematician in the unit that decoded German army and air force Enigma messages, married in 1942.

## Brilliance In A Dank Cottage


In the late 1960s, when her husband became the chief financial officer of Oxford University, Batey took on the restoration of some overgrown gardens near their university-owned home. She became one of England's best-known garden historians and a leading preservationist, for which she was honored with the title of Member of the Order of the British Empire, or MBE, in 1987.

Instead, she spent the war years in a damp and dreary cottage at Bletchley Park. But she was surrounded by brilliant people.


Celebrities from pop star Shakira to race car driver JR Hildebrand have done video spots urging the public to try coding through online tutorials available at Code.org, a nonprofit backed by the tech industry with the goal of expanding computer-science participation.

Lazowska said kids should not learn how to code just because they want to work at Google and Facebook. Students who choose not to go into tech jobs still learn valuable skills. They learn how to recognize a problem and "debug" or solve it.


Proponents argue that children should learn coding for several reasons. Professions from anthropology to zoology are increasingly becoming information fields, so the ability to program a computer for use within a discipline becomes an advantage, said Ed Lazowska, Bill and Melinda Gates chair in computer science and engineering at the University of Washington.

"They said you could build your own game and I said, 'Great! Maybe I can do (game design) in the future,'" Taplet, 17, said recently after creating a simple Star Wars-themed program during a schoolwide coding event. "When I built it, it was amazing. I never realized it would come out like that."

## Lots Of Jobs, Few Classes


Plenty of challenges stand in the way, from finding enough qualified teachers to convincing administrators to invest in a subject that is not covered by standardized tests. But some say parent and student demand is growing so quickly that it could soon become a core subject alongside math and science.

Recruiters say they seek talented minority and low-income students through large college fairs, citywide recruiting sessions, online outreach and videotaped presentations. Some join community-based organizations that help young people enter college, such as the national Posse Foundation, Bright Prospect in Pomona and One Voice in Los Angeles.

The way recruiters avoid poorer schools is "shameful," said education expert Shaun R. Harper. "Many talented students are not given a chance."


Tuesday night, Jonathan Veitch, the president of Occidental College, said he and other administrators were open to considering a list of 14 reforms, including the creation of a black studies major and more diversity training, that student protesters had drawn up.

Last week, an administrator from Claremont McKenna College in California stepped down. Protesters said she did not support minority students. 


"It's affirming," said Dalin Celamy, also a senior at the college. "It lets us know we're not crazy; it's happening to people who are just like you all over the country."

"As a black person, I think black people are just fed up. It's time out for ignoring these issues," said Shaun R. Harper, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  


"Initially, she found me," said coach Natalie Burton. "She was very enthusiastic about college equestrian, SMU in particular, and she emailed and called a lot, definitely something I recommend. She got my attention."

"We used to just copy what (Cheever) did," Vaughan said. The greenhouse structures that are still in use today on flower farms were largely developed by him. "He was very generous with his ideas and knowledge."

"We had sales girls who could talk to all of the cities in the United States," Weston said.


Part of the problem is that there's no zorrero association or union, he said. "They're a thousand-headed monster. You have to deal with each one of them individually and it has been very difficult," he added.

The program seems to work. Of the 2,890 working horses first identified, almost 600 have been turned in. Most of those have been adopted by farms, schools and other organizations.


But it's still not clear how well the program is working for zorreros themselves. The government hopes they will continue to make a living as scrap dealers and freelance haulers with their new motorized vehicles. But only 237 of the almost 3,000 zorreros in the program have a driver's license. The city says it will provide classes, but many worry that might not happen.

## "They've Left Me Without Work"


"Some of the horses do live in very precarious conditions but so do the owners," Mora said. "I've seen five people living in a small room and sharing the space with their horse."

Still, Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith, said things were starting to look up.

Larimer County authorities said 482 people were unaccounted for.


"I can tell you, while I felt hopeless on Friday, I felt a lot of hope, a lot of energy yesterday," Smith said.

Donaghey stressed that not everyone on the list was missing. She hoped the number would become more clear as authorities try to remove names that are on the list more than once.


Morse, a Colorado Springs lawmaker whose support was vital to enactment of the legislation, called the restrictions a measured, common-sense response to gun violence in a state with a long, venerated tradition of gun ownership.

## Big Tunnel Funnelled Poisons Into Water


The so-called American Tunnel collected water from Sunnyside mine, and possibly from other mines, and dumped the toxic tailings into Cement Creek.

Polluted water continued to seep out of the mine. For years, that seemed to be the end of the story.


The company shuttered the Sunnyside mine in 1991, but the mine tailings remained. Company officials' solution was to seal the hole with a concrete plug the size of a railway car. A similar plug was used at Gold King.

Todd Hennis, who owns the Gold King Mine, said Sunnyside is responsible for the water.


For decades, that was that. Polluted water continued to pool and seep out of the mine, but not from the American Tunnel. Facing yet more fines, the company struck a deal with the state in the form of a consent decree: The mine would continue to drip toxic metals into the water, but Sunnyside Gold would do multimillion-dollar reclamation projects downstream.

"I believe Sunnyside knew it was going to happen," Hennis said. They did not take any action "because it will cost them money to fix it," he said.


Seth walked around his backyard, looking at grass and leaves, bird feeders and plant pots. At one point he picked up a dead leaf and said he saw speckles of red in it that he hadn't seen before. The dried leaves on the trees looked like clumps before but now looked distinct, he said.

The Santa Maria ship drifted into a reef and had to be abandoned. Columbus ordered sailors to build a fort nearby in Haiti before sailing the remaining two ships — La Nina and La Pinta — back to Spain to report his findings.

"It was precisely where Christopher Columbus said it would be," Clifford said.


"There is a lot of water, a lot of history around Haiti, and there have been many, many shipwrecks along the coast of Haiti," said Daniel Koski-Karell, whose 1991 mission to confirm his hunch was thwarted by political turmoil.

"There are only seven lombards that have been found in the Western world," Clifford said. "We found the eighth."


But a confident Clifford, who says he's been in touch with Haitian President Michel Martelly, is already envisioning a traveling exhibit of the wreckage that would be "a positive statement from Haiti around the world."

"There is a lot of water, a lot of history around Haiti. And there have been many, many shipwrecks along the coast of Haiti," said Koski-Karell.


Clifford said more could be revealed after he revisits the site in June.
"Why would he leave cannons on the Santa Maria?" Koski-Karell said.


Still, the Army, which is the largest of the four branches of the military, currently excludes women from 25 percent of active-duty jobs, including those in artillery, infantry and armored units. Most of the other jobs off-limits to females are in the Marines. The Pentagon said it expects to open up many jobs to women this year, but that commanders will have until 2016 to ask for exceptions. The commanders will be required to justify any exclusion of women.

The Army, Marines, Air Force and Navy all accept women. However, many jobs are off-limits to them due to the ban. For example, they are not allowed to operate a tank. Nor can they work with cannons and rockets. That is all changing. The military said many of the banned jobs will start opening up this year.


In fact, not many people do think female troops should be confined to desk jobs.

"A lot of people think we should still be sitting behind a desk, but the world is changing," Brashears told USA Today.

"Of particular note is the inclusive, welcoming community" at the UW "that spans beyond the walls of the university and has demonstrably advanced women's meaningful participation in computing," Sanders wrote.

Ed Lazowska is a professor in UW's Computer Science and Engineering Department (CSE). He said the university is doing well, but it can still improve.


"There are female professors, tech talks performed by successful and intelligent women, coding competitions with plenty of female participants and hosts, and sports teams (such as CSE frisbee) that encourage women to join," Singh said by email.

The University of Washington provides a "welcoming community," Sanders said.

In addition to $30 million from the NCAA and a new pledge of $25 million from the NFL for separate endeavors, a $10 million gift to UCLA from Hollywood executive and New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch will help get a national tracking system for concussions off the ground.

Officials announced that $65 million had been pledged to pay for these efforts.


In a briefing Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said reports that concussions may set the stage for learning problems, mental health issues and even dementia have made parents wary of allowing their children to participate in organized athletics.

"Hopefully, 20 years from today, athletes won't be discovering" head injuries they got years earlier "playing in high school and college," Tisch said. "This is kind of a new frontier."

Scientists watching through a hidden video camera were smitten. They had installed the camera and wireless transmitter as an experimental method of monitoring condors, a species slowly recovering from the brink of extinction three decades ago.

He stares at his toes, lifting each one as if playing a piano.


The scientists say the success of the camera holds the promise of improving the care of any number of endangered species.

## We're Back!


Cameras are even helping, indirectly, with the study of the effects of the environment on humans. In Missoula, Montana, cameras placed in an osprey nest are being used to identify the species of fish the birds are bringing home from a nearby river. The goal is to find out how heavy metals are being dispersed in the environment.

Using the cameras, scientists now have a full picture of the condors' home life for the first time.


"Now, we use video footage to decide whether or not entry is even necessary," Brandt said.

"Some of the footage is heartbreaking to watch," Molly Astelle said. She works at the Santa Barbara Zoo.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said the Confederate flag is part of the "rich and provocative history" of the state while also acknowledging that it also "represents pain and oppression" for some.

James Clyburn is an African-American lawmaker in the national government. He says the flag needs to be removed. Symbols like this flag are connected to a history of racism in America and they help racism continue, he said.


Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that "I don't think the federal government or federal candidates should be making decisions on everything, opining on everything. This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina."

Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, posted on Twitter asking for the flag to be taken down. "It is a symbol of racial hatred," he said. "Remove it now to honor Charleston victims."


Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker urged more time and debate. "I think they're going to have a good, healthy debate, and should have a healthy debate in South Carolina among officials at the state level," he said Saturday. "I think out of deference, before we have that discussion, we should allow the families of the loved ones to bury their dead."

Rick Santorum, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said that he doesn't think that the national government or people running for president "should be making decisions on everything. This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina."


Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he understands both sides of the issue, but that it's a matter for South Carolina residents to decide.

Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said that the time is not right for this conversation. Out of respect, he said, "we should allow the families of the loved ones to bury their dead" first.


Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and then-Secretary of State Katherine Harris, had a Confederate flag removed from the Florida state Capitol in 2001. At the time Bush said, "I thought it was appropriate to take those flags down and put them in the museum where people can appreciate our heritage, but not have them fly as a symbol of what we are today as a state."

Ohio Governor John Kasich is expected to announce soon that he is running for president. He said that it is "up to the people of South Carolina to decide, but if I were a citizen of South Carolina, I'd be for taking it down."


Twiggs said his "Targeted Man" series of faceless men bearing bulls-eyes harkens back to the Ku Klux Klan using white robes and burning torches "to try to scare us."

The British-based oil company SOCO carried out seismic tests in Virunga in 2014, touching off an international outcry over possible damage to the UNESCO World Heritage site. After blistering international criticism, the company said in March that it would have no further involvement with an oil concession in the park.

The film rights for her best-selling memoir, "Life in Motion," were optioned by New Line Cinema last summer. Copeland has also written an illustrated children's book, "Firebird," named for one of her first big roles with the American Ballet Theatre.

## A Late Start And A Steady Rise


The film, which opened in New York and went into wider release soon after, also touches, not surprisingly, on the obstacles — including loneliness and self-doubt — that Copeland experienced as she rose through the ranks in the heavily white environment of classical dance. She comments early in the film that some people think she focuses too much on her race — on the fact that she is not just a ballerina, but a black ballerina.

She is excited to be a principal dancer. Copeland also says the big part means that she gets to dance less. There are many principals who want the starring parts.


In the following decades, "the number of bushels of corn per acre doubled, and then continued to rise each year," as Paul Roberts wrote in his 2009 book "The End of Food." Corn yields have risen ever since, with only brief interruptions due to sporadic droughts, interruptions that farmers are countering with further engineered corn.

## Less Used As Corn On The Cob, Popcorn


Advancements in farming technology and science paved the way for corn's ascent in the American food system, but what has allowed for corn to seep into just about every food Americans eat today is that, above all, it is inexpensive.

The first is sweet corn. Americans grill sweet corn in the summer, and boil or bake it during the rest of the year. Sweet corn is the most loved kind of corn. We eat it on the cob and get it stuck in our teeth. It is what most people think of when they hear the word "corn." However, very little of the corn we grow is sweet corn.


"When I started, we were the only corn maze around here," said Vierra, who opened his annual pumpkin patch business 23 years ago. "Now, there are corn mazes all over the place."

At the same time, Thomas and his fellow justices determined that so-called "complementary DNA," which is synthetic, is "patent eligible because it is not naturally occurring."

"You made me look really old," Judge Ronald S. Coen deadpanned from the bench. "But you got the cleft chin right."

Edwards removed a plastic bag bulging with pens and markers from her fancy purse. She never uses a pencil and does not erase. She set her drawing pad on her lap.


Her pen darted over the page as Marion "Suge" Knight, a former rap mogul who now faces a murder charge, shuffled into the room. Bold strokes traced his scowl and handcuffed hands, the slouch of a detective on the witness stand, the dent in the judge's chin.

"I'm sorry," Edwards said, laughing. "I'll do better."


As Knight's attorney held an impromptu news conference, Edwards taped the sketches onto a wall and the photographers whose stations had paid for the images soon lined up single file, taking turns shooting close-ups as Edwards shooed away non-paying onlookers hoping to sneak a cellphone photo.

There are not many sketch artists around today. Some have found work in courtrooms where cameras are not allowed, or with judges who do not want the distraction that the television news can bring.


Knight's lawyer, Matthew Fletcher, wandered over for a look at himself.

As the Knight hearing ended, Edwards dashed outside to put the finishing touches on her sketches.


Edwards had been working for years as a fashion illustrator, hired by design houses and department stores and teaching at colleges around Los Angeles. She saw that her skills in fashion could translate to the courtroom.

"They were awful, just awful," she said. "I told my husband, 'That's what I want to do. I can do that.'"


Next was KNBC-TV, which gave her a shot, sending her to the soon-to-be-infamous "palimony" trial of actor Lee Marvin in 1979.

She went to one station and showed someone her drawings. "He told me 'You should stick with fashion,'" Edwards said.


Over the years, there have been disagreements and the occasional jostling for prime seats in the courtroom, Robles said.

Edwards said the way she works in court is always the same.


With the advent of photography and video, the 1935 trial of Richard Bruno Hauptmann in the murder of aviator Charles Lindbergh's son became a media hullabaloo — including hidden newsreel cameras, clandestine radio broadcasts and flashbulb bursts.

O.J. Simpson's trial, where he was accused of killing his former wife and another man, was among the first to be shown live on television with TV cameras in the courtroom. Edwards said people thought it would be the end for courtroom artists.


The O.J. Simpson murder case, the so-called Trial of the Century, was among the first to be broadcast live on television.

Edwards can easily blend in and bring the feeling of the entire room into her sketches.


"We all thought O.J. was the swan song for courtroom artists," Edwards said.

"She's the public eye in the courtroom," Rose said.

"Whether this warming itself is a direct function of climate change or not, we can't say," said Mark Wells, an oceanography professor in the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine. However, the climate change models project warming along the coastlines over the next several decades, so "this type of event probably is going to become much more frequent in the future."

"We're looking forward to having Dungeness crab for Christmas Eve. We could move on to something else. It wouldn't kill us, but we would be sad," she said.

In 1900, the American archaeologist Harriet Boyd Hawes discovered the site of Azoria as part of her exploration of the area. But she only conducted a trench test, because she was looking for older Minoan ruins. The site remained unexplored for the next century.

The decision was based, Putin said, on Crimean people's "free expression of the will" in the referendum in which more than 96 percent supported rejoining Russia, which controlled the peninsula until Nikita Khrushchev transferred authority to Ukraine in 1954 in what was then a shift between two republics of the Soviet Union. Ukraine gained its independence in 1991.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed agreements with Crimea's pro-Russian leaders. The agreements give Crimea over to Russia. The signing ceremony was held in the grand St. George's Hall in the Kremlin, a historic fortress in Moscow. Shortly before, Putin gave a heated hour-long speech. It was greeted by applause from the joyful crowd.


In his speech, Putin blamed Ukraine's "nationalists, Russophobes and anti-Semites" who he said came to power in Ukraine last month when the country's pro-Russia leader fled in the face of protests.

Putin said the decision to take over Crimea was based on the Crimean people's "free expression of the will." In a popular vote on Sunday, more than 96 percent of Crimeans supported rejoining Russia.  Russia controlled Crimea until 1954 when the leader of the Soviet Union transferred it to Ukraine, and many Russians still live in Crimea. Ukraine gained independence in 1991 after the Soviet Union fell.


Putin then blamed Khrushchev for handing Crimea to Ukraine six decades ago, calling the late Soviet leader only by his last name and questioned his motives.

Putin said that the West is threatening Russia. And Russia will react.


Putin promised that the interests of all of Crimea's ethnic groups would be respected and that the peninsula would have three state languages: Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar.

Along with the mill — one of the most technically sophisticated in the world at the time — Hershey built modern utilities, schools, health clinics and subsidized housing for his workers. The town's ballpark was one of the island's most beautiful, drawing teams from all over the island.

## One Woman Has Always Been There


Hershey left no heirs when he died in 1945, giving most of his fortune to charity. He had already instructed his executives to sell off his Cuba holdings, the company's only properties outside the United States. It proved to be a prescient business decision.

When the new Castro government took over, it made the Hershey mill the property of the Cuban government. The town cafeteria was reopened and a sign was hung outside that read "Thanks to the Revolution."


Hershey was still a beloved figure in the town, but Lobo was easily cast as a capitalist villain by the revolutionaries, recalled Agustin Perez, who was a teenager at the time. His father and grandfather worked for Hershey.

The government retrained some of the workers for other jobs, but many people left Hershey to live in other places. The town's heart, its entire purpose for existing, was gone.


Perez, who worked at the mill for 25 years, said it remained productive long after its nationalization, getting replacement parts from the Eastern Bloc countries, and later from Japan and Sweden.

It did not matter. Rojas is 23. She said she just wants someone — anyone — to bring the town back to life.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has decided to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, a decision that removes a principal impediment to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries and accepts that Havana's role as an agent of revolution has long since slipped into history.

WASHINGTON — The United States ended all contact with Cuba in 1961. This week, President Barack Obama cleared the way for rebuilding normal relations between the two countries.


"Our hemisphere, and the world, look very different today than they did 33 years ago," Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement.

Obama said many Americans approve of his plan to fix the relationship with Cuba.


Obama's decision followed White House receipt last week of a State Department recommendation. Kerry said that the recommendation "reflects the Department's assessment that Cuba meets the criteria established by Congress for rescission. While the United States has had, and continues to have, significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba's policies and actions, these concerns and disagreements fall outside the criteria for designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism."

Josefina Vidal is the director of U.S. relations at Cuba's Foreign Ministry. She said the decision to take Cuba off the list is fair. She added that Cuba never deserved to be on it in the first place.


Ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, was critical of the possibility that Cuba could be removed from the State Department list while providing refuge to American fugitives. One is Joanne Chesimard, now known as Assata Shakur, a black militant who fatally shot a New Jersey State Police trooper in 1973 and escaped from prison after being convicted of the murder.

Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona agrees that Cuba should return the fugitives. "It might be a nice gesture," he said. "but it's not going to happen."

WASHINGTON — The United States and Cuba plan to begin talks to normalize relations and open embassies in each other's countries, an Obama administration official confirmed Wednesday, the first step in what could break a 50-year stalemate between the nations.

WASHINGTON — In 1961, the United States cut off all contact with Cuba. On Wednesday, a government official said the two nations will begin talks to repair their relationship.


The news comes after the release of American contractor Alan Gross, who was convicted of illegally bringing communications equipment to Cuba as a U.S. government contractor, and was imprisoned on the island nation for five years.

The news comes after the release of American Alan Gross from a Cuban jail. In 2011, Cuba found him guilty of bringing cellphones and computers into Cuba, which was against the law. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail.


The administration has latitude to alter the diplomatic and economic relationship through use of its executive powers. But anti-Castro activists, including the Florida delegation in Congress, are likely to resist such steps.

## Let's Start Talking


There had been growing expectation among experts on Cuba that President Barack Obama would make a major move on restoring relations with Havana at some point after U.S. mid-term elections in November and before next spring's pan-American summit. Cuba has been invited to the summit, at the insistence of the rest of Latin America, and Obama will inevitably be forced there to deal with Raul Castro.

Legally, only Congress can end the embargo. However, Congress is not needed to improve the relationship with Cuba. Obama can use his power as president to change relationships with any country. However, anti-Castro activists are likely to oppose it. Florida lawmakers will also likely object.


There were some hopeful signs in the genetic analysis of the captive Cuban crocodiles. Approximately 30 percent had a unique subset of genes — DNA they do not share with the rest of the captive population. That makes them valuable reservoirs of Cuban crocodile DNA, and it could be used to help the entire population maintain genetic diversity in the face of the American crocodile onslaught. Researchers plan to use this information to help design Cuba's first formal attempt at a scientifically informed crocodile management plan.
A team of researchers led by Yoamel Milián-García studied genes found in the scales of 227 wild crocodiles. They found that the level of interbreeding is much higher than previously believed: 49 percent of the wild crocodiles sampled had mixed genes.


Distribution will rely on cellphones and emails because Cubans have more mobile phones than computers — a meager 74 per 1,000 according to the latest official figures, she said — and easily available memory devices such USB flash drives, DVDs and CDs.

"I think some children have a greater maturity level and you don't need to be quite as strict with them," said Risinger. She runs a communications consulting firm.


Shengqiang Cai, an engineer at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved with this study, says that Guttag and Boyce's material is "innovative and inspiring." According to Cai, the creation of this method for creating modifiable surfaces not only has many important applications for surface engineering but may also provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanics of biological surface patterning.

"This project was originally about camouflage," says Mark Guttag, the lead engineer of the new printer.


Once the material is printed, its rigid polymers are stuck in a fixed array and cannot change positions relative to one another. But Guttag and Boyce have proposed a number of means for achieving different types of surfaces from the same sheet of printed material. For example, by using elongated rigid polymers instead of spherical ones, scientists could create surfaces that are smooth along one direction but ridged in the opposite direction. Some rigid polymers might yield differently textured surfaces depending on the strength of the applied force. If they are lightly squeezed, they form one texture, but further compression would cause the polymers to rotate relative to one another, creating a different topography. Other polymers could swell or shrink relative to the soft material.

But public health advocates have grown concerned that progress has stalled in recent years.

"This is a bold step," said Dr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey. She is president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. She said that CVS is being a leader. It is helping to make the country healthier.


The company said it has "identified incremental opportunities that are expected to offset the profitability impact," but did not specify what they are. CVS reported total revenues of $123 billion in 2012.
In June, Starbucks said people can't smoke within 25 feet of its coffee shops. The company feels responsible for providing "a safe and healthy environment." Starbucks already bans smoking inside its stores.


"We are still a country where people want to buy milk refrigerated," Gallagher said, but there are cost savings for businesses if milk could be moved on non-refrigerated trucks or could be stored without having to be kept cold.

Someone slapping a downed dairy cow to get the animal back on its feet could be doing it to save the animal's life, said Joanna Storm, who previously worked on a Wisconsin milk-hauling route and has been on many dairy farms.

## Not A Well-Run Dairy Farm


"A slap on the nose and a crack on the ass to get the cow up can make the difference between scaring her to get up and her having to be shot and made into dog food," Storm said.

## Far Away From Family


Klefstad spends three weeks working sunup to sundown, then gets back on the train for a week with Tiffany, Kelvin and daughter Avery back in western Wisconsin. The brutal-but-profitable lifestyle leaves legions of workers juggling split lives of long hours and dislocating separation.

So he set off for North Dakota. He found a job quickly. Now, at only 28 with no college degree, he's earning more than $100,000 a year cleaning up spills and washing sludge off trucks.


"Maybe it's the level of danger, but I do love it," he says. "We keep the Bakken running."

But Klefstad doesn't like the idea of bringing his family here. "It just doesn't seem like there's any type of connection with anybody," he says. "Everyone is here for their own self, doing their own thing and then going home."

Dali "wanted art that took you over," said Goodby. "He wanted to take you away and do something different with your head, and that's what this does."
Kathy Greif works at the museum. She said many visitors came to see its last two big shows. Those exhibits explored Dali's friendships with artists Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso. Many people love Disney and want to try VR. She thinks many visitors will come to see this show, too.


Museum executive director Hank Hine said during a media tour Wednesday that the exhibit — called "Warhol: Art. Fame. Mortality." — is the first large-scale special exhibit for the museum since it moved into a stunning new building along St. Petersburg's waterfront in 2011.

The exhibit's a first for The Dali, an entire museum devoted to the surrealist master's work. Surrealism was an artistic style that featured strange, dream-like artworks. Salvador Dali was a Spanish artist who died in 1989. He was known for his paintings of things like melting clocks.


Warhol often visited Dali when Dali stayed in a suite at the St. Regis Hotel in New York (one story goes that Dali tied Warhol to a spinning board and splattered paint over him). Warhol also made one of his famous "screen tests" of Dali, and like the others filmed, Warhol told Dali not to move during the three-minute filming.

Warhol would have approved.
Dali ignored Warhol's instruction to sit still and walked away.

"I believe in this project. It has been an important gift to the nation and there is still work to be done," Hall said.


"Every time you crack open a copy of DARE, that myth is shattered," said Barrett, whose radio show reaches hundreds of thousands of listeners in 31 states. "You find history and culture. You find a continuous connection to the past. DARE has information about all of the other languages that have contributed to English.

"Fifty years ago it was almost totally pop," Hall said, pointing to a map of the state. "Now soda is coming from the eastern United States and it's pushing out pop."


The researchers released their initial findings Wednesday after the experiment's first few months at the Sanford Underground Research Facility, which was built in the former Homestake gold mine in South Dakota's Black Hills.

The latest attempt to find dark matter is happening nearly a mile underground in an abandoned gold mine. On Wednesday, scientists there announced their search has so far come up empty.


"We know there's stuff out there that is something else, and that makes these searches hugely important because we know we are missing most of the universe," said Neal Weiner, director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at New York University, who was not part of the search.

"It's ghost-like matter," scientist Daniel McKinsey said of dark matter.

Kass said schools have to get involved. Today's children are the least active in U.S. history, he said.


The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has argued that the Central American children, some of whom have been victims of violence, trafficking or other crimes, are refugees who should be eligible for asylum. But the U.S. government has not given them that designation as a group, which would help open the door to URM eligibility.

The program lets the children stay in the United States and matches them with foster parents.


Nevertheless, some argue that granting refugee status to the Central American children would be the surest way to get them the help and care they need. Kimberly Haynes of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which partners with the federal government and states in operating URM, said there is little difference between the Central American kids and refugees from Asia or Africa who've enrolled in the program over the years.

Ta was clearly a refugee. The question now is if children crossing into the United States from Central America are as well.


Federal money for URM flows through the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. As attention to refugee crises has grown since the early 1980s, more states have agreed to participate.

The U.S. government does not consider the children refugees. That label would help the children use the URM program to settle in the United States.


The NFL said its initial investigation confirmed that some of the footballs used in the first half of the conference title game were underinflated. On Thursday, Belichick deferred questions on the game balls to Tom Brady; the quarterback also denied any impropriety.

Patriots coach Bill Belichick said that his team did not do anything wrong. He spoke to reporters on Saturday afternoon. "We feel like we followed the rules of the game," he said. "We try to do everything right."


But instead of getting ready for the Super Bowl, he said he has spent far too much time the past week studying the science and learning about "bladders, air gauges, stitching, pressure, game day football preparation, rubdowns and so forth."

He admitted that this was just an idea. He does not know for sure. "I'm not a scientist. I'm not an expert," Belichick said. "I'm just telling you what I know."


"I'm embarrassed to talk about the amount of time that I've put into this relative to the other important challenge in front of us," he said. "It sounds simple, and I'm not trying to say that we're trying to land a guy on the moon, but there are a lot of things here that are a little hard to get a handle on."

## Team Of Cheaters?


Yee said that Brady and his representatives "presented the Commissioner with an unprecedented amount of electronic data, all of which is incontrovertible. I do not think that any private citizen would have agreed to provide anyone with the amount of information that Tom was willing to reveal to the Commissioner. Tom was completely transparent. All of the electronic information was ignored; we don't know why. The extent to which Tom opened up his private life to the Commissioner will become clear in the coming days."

Goodell also said that Brady blocked the investigation by destroying his cellphone. Brady knew it contained information the investigators had asked for, Goodell said.


The truth is, though, that no one really knows what it would mean for low-wage workers if the federal government required their bosses to pay them $15 an hour. Other economists have argued it's at least worth a try.

## Hourly Pay Was Not A Big Topic


Matthew Collins of the University of York, a co-author on the paper, put it this way: "What we found is a microbial Pompeii."

Matthew Collins of the University of York co-wrote the paper. He compared the discovery to finding the ancient Roman city of Pompeii, which was destroyed in a volcano eruption in 79 AD. Lava from the volcano preserved the town. People visiting Pompeii today can see what the city looked like and how people lived 2,000 years ago.


Calcified plaque is the rough, bumpy stuff you might notice coating your teeth if you have skipped too many dental appointments. Today, dentists scrape plaque off our teeth as part of our regular dental cleanings, but before the days of modern oral care, it could grow layer upon layer until sometimes the hard plaque covering a tooth was thicker than the tooth itself.

On the many nights she spent alone, Sanchez Paulsen wrote what she describes as the most important bedtime story she'll ever tell: a fantastical tale about a young elf who joins with his brothers to battle dragons as they visit their mother in the land of the fairies.

When Brannon was about 3, he asked her a question. He wanted to know if it would be OK to turn her into little pieces of paper.


At one point, she was so afraid of living in Tijuana that she and the boys would spend the night crammed into the bedroom closet.

Sanchez Paulsen's story ends with hope. The elf and his mother "would be together again in the happiest city in the world where they were once very happy."

This made it possible for Rodrigo to attend Jefferson, one of Berkeley's highest-rated schools. Or it did, until the familiar world his family had built for him was taken from Rodrigo on Jan. 10.

Almost all the family's belongings remain in Berkeley. Rodrigo now lives in a land that is unfamiliar.


Back in Berkeley, when the school year resumed after winter break, Rodrigo's teacher, Barbara Wenger, was puzzled by his absence. After a few days, word reached the school that Rodrigo's family had been deported and would not be returning.

The Internet allowed the Jefferson students to play Minecraft with Rodrigo. The kids were able to come up with their own rules. Borders, immigration laws and travel papers were not a problem. The game also made it seem as if Rodrigo was still next to them and not playing from thousands of miles away.

Unfortunately, though, even these measures have come under scrutiny.

## Diamond Heist History


— A 2010 review in the International Journal of Pediatric Obesity that found large epidemiological studies "support the existence of an association between artificially sweetened beverage consumption and weight gain in children."

"I am absolutely convinced that there's no way they are causing weight gain," Hill said. Drinking diet sodas is "not something people should worry about," he added.


— A nationwide study, called Growing Up Today, of more than 10,000 children ages 9 to 14 that found that, for boys, intakes of diet soda "were significantly associated with weight gains."

Hill's own study found that people who drank diet soda lost more weight than those who drank water. Hill admitted he had gotten hundreds of thousands of dollars from the American Beverage Association to pay for the study. However, he said the Association had not tried to influence his research findings.

Alison E. Moyer, now a Ph.D. student at North Carolina State University, says the cigar-shaped "microbodies," just one-millionth of a meter long, might simply be impressions left by very old bacteria. Their size and shape, among other attributes, do not rule out either interpretation, she says.

Fogle is accused by Russia of spying for the CIA under the guise that he was a low-level U.S. diplomat in Moscow. His arrest by Kremlin security services was so intensely publicized on Tuesday that it appeared designed to embarrass the United States and its intelligence service. State-run television showed Fogle, wearing a blonde wig askew under a ballcap, and what were reportedly the strange tools of his spy tradecraft, including wads of cash, several pairs of dark sunglasses, a compass and Moscow map, a knife, more wigs, pepper spray and a letter laying out how the spy recruitment would go.

Fogle, 29, seems to have achieved his dream. And the whole world now seems to know about it.


"I doubt he had this kit on him," he said. " It was planted on him for political theater."

"If the allegations Russia is making are true, it appears that our effort at gaining intelligence is rather lame. It reads like something you would see in a movie. I know our intelligence community is very sophisticated, so that's why it doesn't compute," she told reporters.


He also noticed the letter opens with "Dear friend" and closes with "Your friends." Those phrases recalled the communications that Russians sent to Hanssen, O'Neill said. That is how Russian handlers wrote to Hanssen. It is not how Americans talk to Russians. "That doesn't ring true to me," he said.

"I wouldn't read too much into one incident one way or another," spokesman Patrick Ventrell said.


Earnest thought Fogle was likely ensnared by "a dangle operation," where Russian agents made an opportunity so attractive that the CIA agent could not resist. The Russians might have been motivated to publicly embarrass a CIA agent after the Russians in 2010 had the long-term cover blown for its ring of 10 spies in the United States.

Eric O'Neill, a former FBI officer, said he believes Fogle really works for the CIA. And he probably was trying to recruit double agents. That seems believable. But the items that Fogle carried with him did not appear to be genuine tools of a CIA spy.


Fogle joined the U.S. foreign service in February 2011, when he had an address in Virginia, according to public records. He was reportedly working as a third secretary in the political division of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The title is among the most junior positions in the U.S. diplomatic corps.

"That doesn't ring true to me," he said.


O'Neill, the former FBI agent, was less confident that Fogle could again go undercover.

"I am not thrown off by what looks like '70s tradecraft," said Earnest, now executive director of the International Spy Museum in Washington. "We used very traditional means to run spies."


According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, nearly 100 aerial advertising firms went out of business after Congress codified the no-fly zones over the Disney parks and sporting events. Pilots have been especially critical of the sporting event no-fly zones, which may last just a few hours but are implemented thousands of times a year.

## Disney Wins Its "War"


Craig Spence, vice president of operations and international affairs for the association, said the restrictions served no real security purpose.

In the long war between Disney and the airplane advertisers, Disney won.


Dalton said workers know they need to preserve the Disney magic. But telling them they cannot post anything about their identities, she said, is a blanket ban that takes things too far.

"From Disney's point of view, fantasy's real," Lee Cockerell said. He used to help run Disney World. "You don't want to start disappointing kids and having this out there."


"It was a very important driver of our business during the holidays," Barry said. "Disney's ability to carve new content is incredible."

The popularity of "Frozen" products caught everyone by surprise, said Mike Botterman. He is a vice president of the 99 Cents Only stores.


Disney has to keep pushing out new content with new characters to engage shoppers with new products — one reason that the "Star Wars" franchise has remained popular, said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets. But customers constantly bathed with fresh movies and merchandise may weary of the brand.

## Playing Dress-Up


Disney is widely seen as among the most disability-friendly companies in the world, and its Guest Assistance Cards are a big reason why. Though they don't completely eliminate waiting, they generally permit a disabled guest and his or her party to immediately enter the FastPass queue at an attraction or use an alternative entrance.

"Unfortunately, our current program has been abused and exploited to such an extent" that Disney can not keep it going, Meg Crofton said in a statement. She runs Disney's theme parks in the U.S. and France. Disney released the statement Friday in a letter to groups that help disabled people.


Industry experts say Disney might be better off focusing its attention on other theme park projects, including a $4 billion resort in Shanghai, slated to open next year.

## More And More Visitors Every Year


The attendance surge comes as the nation's travel industry enjoys a surge in spending as the economy continues to rebound from the recession, and a more recent lull in travel during winter storms on the East Coast and in the Midwest.

The large jump in attendance comes just as Americans are spending more on travel. Businesses are growing and fewer people are out of work now. Also, more people are eager to travel now that winter storms have finally ended.


"Nothing has really changed or been added in years," said annual pass holder Ken Bruce, a longtime fan and visitor to Disneyland.

Ken Bruce owns the cheaper no-weekend  pass. He worries that Disneyland may consider suspending his pass to make room for high-spending out-of-town visitors.


U.S. officers said the video-watching analysts working half a world away are no match for spotters and other troops feeding intelligence from the front lines.

In past wars, U.S. troops on the ground helped to provide information. Today, U.S. commanders rely mainly on information from the analysts here.


And in Massachusetts, Howitt's bill is pending in the Joint Transportation Committee. Drivers can't wear headphones in the state, and it should be the same for bicyclists, he said.

Jeffrey Dinowitz, a lawmaker from New York state, says he has tried for years to get a bill passed there. His bill would stop bicyclists from using cellphones or texting. 


"In this age of electronics and constantly being entertained, I see bicyclists with headphones on, particularly in the city (Boston)," Howitt said. "A biker could be cutting across an intersection, and an ambulance is coming through and he's not hearing it if he's playing music very loud."

Dinowitz says, "I've seen people bicycling and talking on their cellphones at the same time. I've seen people texting. That's crazy." New York already does not allow drivers to use cellphones on the road. 


New York state Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, said he has tried for years to get a bill passed that would prohibit cyclists in the state from using hand-held cellphones or texting. Drivers in New York already are banned from using them.

Peter Wilborn is a lawyer. He belongs to a group that works with bicyclists. He says, "I don't think we need laws specifically for this."


"I've seen people bicycling and talking on their cellphones at the same time. I've seen people texting. That's crazy," he said.

## One Bike Group Agrees: No Texting


To reduce the number of injuries and deaths associated with distracted walking, Utah and New Jersey have experimented with fines for texting in dangerous walking situations. New York state has lowered speed limits in New York City, in part to make traffic less dangerous for distracted walkers.

## More People Are Hurt Every Year


The 23 new "Fashionista" Barbie dolls not only have flexible ankles that can accommodate either heels or flats, but they also come in a more diverse variety: eight skin tones, 14 face shapes, 22 hairdos, 23 hair colors and 18 eye colors.

took off her shoes, her plastic feet remained on tiptoe.


One "Film Director" doll is outfitted in jeans, scarf, pink top, utility belt and black flats. "And with her new articulated ankle," the ad reads, "this professional can go from running-around-the-set flats to movie-premiere heels!"

A fashion magazine article wondered if an overweight Barbie was next. The classic Barbie doll has an unusual body type. Barbie is very skinny and does not look like a normal woman.


The number of Asian-American/Pacific Islanders on Capitol Hill will increase by one in the new Congress, with 13 Democrats and one Republican.

Representative Mia Love of Utah became Congress' first female African-American Republican lawmaker. Her arrival marks the first time that Congress has male and female African-Americans from both parties.


An area where the new Congress remains mostly the same diversity-wise is religion. Ninety-two percent of the incoming Congress members are Christian and 57 percent are Protestant, according to new Pew Research Center study.

Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina made history last November. He became the first African-American senator elected in the South in more than 100 years.


In the last Congress, 90 percent of the members were Christian, and about 56 percent were Protestant, according to Pew's study on the religious composition of the 114th Congress. About 31 percent of the 114th Congress is Catholic, similar to the previous session.

## Hispanics, And Asian-Americans


"I'm bringing a French dance group from the poorest neighborhood of France, which has handicapped people in its group, to Greece, a country in chaos, and we're doing something without limits," Bulbulyan said. "It's all that, together with crazy logistics."

"We liked each other," Papadamaki explained. They began talking about dance. One day after a fun dive, they suddenly came up with the idea for an underwater ballet. "Let's see if it's possible, an underwater dance performance," she said.


Homework was a serious undertaking. Straight A's were expected. Anything less and Gladys Richardson could resort to corporal punishment.

Last fall, Richardson walked into Louise Cannon's house. When the 79-year-old woman saw her doctor, she beamed.


Money also is a factor in the shortages. During the course of their careers, primary care physicians earn around $3 million less than their colleagues in specialty fields, which makes primary care a less appealing path for many medical students.

Many mental health professionals don't accept Medicaid, or any type of health coverage.


For example, health care professionals can serve more people by using Skype or other telemedicine technologies to examine, treat and monitor patients. Similarly, patients can be fitted with electronic devices that remind them to take their medications and provide other guidance about their conditions. These and other technologies are already keeping patients out of hospitals and doctors' offices.

## "Work-Life Balance" Over Money


Using a tongue to get a little water into your mouth may seem far less efficient than simply sucking it in, but in 2010 Jung and colleagues showed that cats, at least, have an unexpectedly effective way of using their tongues to drink water.

One way animals drink is by sucking water. This way is called suction. Humans use suction. We use our cheeks to suck up liquid to drink. The cheeks create a vacuum inside our mouths. Suction is what lets us drink water through a cup or straw.


Menomonee Falls-based War Dogs honors four-legged fighting forces by marching in parades, appearing at shows and giving presentations on the history of war dogs — anything to spread the word about a little-known part of American military history.

## Finally, A Statue


To commemorate military canines, War Dogs raised $5,400 for a 6-foot-tall gray granite statue that will be unveiled June 22 at Village Park in Menomonee Falls. Participating in the monument dedication will be law enforcement dogs and their handlers, veterans groups and War Dogs members and their pups. Also, Army dog handlers who served in Vietnam are coming from Colorado, Minnesota and Illinois to attend.

The group has no dues and no meetings. It has only a few rules.


Also, members' dogs must be among the 16 or so breeds used by the U.S. military, including German shepherd, collie, Labrador retriever, Belgian Malinois, Airedale, boxer, beagle, Newfoundland, husky/malamute, giant schnauzer, standard poodle, pit bull and Jack Russell terrier.

## Pint-Sized Missions


"At parades we see men wearing World War II caps stand and salute," said Tracy Hays, owner of an American Staffordshire terrier named Kestrel.

Carolyn Summers is always at the back of the parades. She carries her Yorkshire terrier D.D. in a military helmet.


Many people are surprised a pint-size Yorkie was a war dog, but D.D. represents a Yorkshire terrier named Smoky who was discovered in a New Guinea foxhole in World War II. Smoky carried telegraph wire through a narrow pipe at an airfield, flew on rescue missions and visited wounded soldiers.

Hays' dog Kestrel represents Sergeant Stubby. The terrier helped capture a German spy during World War I.


Summers contacted Smoky's owner, William Wynne, to let him know she was honoring Smoky's service after reading his book "Yorkie Doodle Dandy," which featured a photo of Smoky inside a G.I. helmet. The 91-year-old Wynne wrote back from Ohio thanking her for remembering Smoky.

## Welcome Home


Hays' dog Kestrel represents a terrier named Sergeant Stubby who spent 18 months with an American infantry division during World War I and is credited with capturing a German spy and saving his unit by alerting them of a gas attack.

During Vietnam, dog handlers were targeted by the enemy. Their dogs were too good at tracking.


"Some of the dogs were fought," says Russell, a Chicago-based writer, attorney and shelter volunteer. "Some of the dogs were dumped in trash cans. Some of the dogs belonged to hoarders. Some were beaten mercilessly. Every one of these dogs had a terrible start. But this shows the resilience of the dogs and the compassion of people."

Cynthia Bathurst is in charge of Safe Humane Chicago. "These are the dogs everyone should care about," she says.


"It's very clear under state law that dogs are not permitted to chase or pursue wildlife such as elephants," Peet said. "Just because a facility has a USDA license doesn't mean that state laws don't apply. State laws absolutely still apply to the Pittsburgh Zoo, and that's why PETA is calling on the Fish and Game Commission to enforce the law and ensure that the Pittsburgh Zoo stops endangering animals and the public by allowing dogs to chase elephants."

## Praise And Food Reward For Elephants


Still, Gray said the zoo stands by its handling of elephants.

Peet felt the zoo was sticking to an old-fashioned approach. She said the Pittsburgh Zoo should follow the example of the San Diego Zoo, the North Carolina Zoo and the Oakland Zoo. Peet said those zoos use methods that allow elephants to live free of fear and bullying.

But with dogs, who suffer from many of the same old-age ailments as their masters, it could be possible to find out in a few years whether rapamycin is beneficial.

## Healthy And Active


Rapamycin functions partly by inactivating a protein that promotes cell growth, Kaeberlein explained. As a result, cells grow more slowly, which retards the spread of cancer. The same mechanism is very likely activated by caloric restriction — another approach that has been shown to extend the lives of laboratory animals, including monkeys.

In most dog breeds, cancer is the main cause of death. Some dog breeds, including Newfoundlands and Dobermans, are at high risk for heart failure. Large dogs live a shorter time than small breeds.


But that's not the kind of project federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health, with a focus on human disease, are likely to fund, Austad said.

No one should expect a miracle, Halter said.

Initially, the wolves sought out the carcasses and scraps of meat left behind by people. Over time, these hang-around wolves began to fill a special role in human hunter-gatherer society, the researchers surmised.

They say that dogs evolved from a species of European wolf. The wolf species died out a long time ago.


Until recently, many archaeologists and biologists believed that dogs were first domesticated no more than 13,000 years ago, either in East Asia or the Middle East. One key find was a burial site in Israel that contained the 12,000-year-old remains of an elderly man cradling a puppy, evidence of the unique bond between dogs and humans.

Dogs are the only living descendants of these early European wolves. Dogs did not come from modern day wolves, said Wayne.


Peter Savolainen, an associate professor of evolutionary genetics at Sweden's Royal Institute of Technology, said there was plenty of evidence that dogs were first domesticated in China, probably as a source of food.

Larson said Wayne's discovery is an important contribution to science. The origin of dogs has been hard to pin down. Scientists have come up with crazy ideas about where dogs came from and how, he said.


"There has been an increased commercialization of the teeth, and that's a little troubling," said study coauthor Scott Baker, associate director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University. As the traditional hunt gains a commercial value, it "drives a type of unsustainable exploitation."

## How Many Dolphins Are Being Killed?


What they found was troubling: during just the first three months of 2013, at least 1,674 dolphins were killed by Fanalei villagers. Spotted dolphins accounted for most of the kills, followed by spinner dolphins and bottlenose dolphins.

The study looked at one village called Fanalei, where the hunt was popular. The village made a deal in 2010 with an international group. The group gave them money to keep them from hunting the dolphins.


The decision to move or leave the clock alone is made by the bulletin's science and security board, which includes physicists and environmental scientists from around the world, in consultation with the bulletin's Board of Sponsors, which includes more than a dozen Nobel laureates.

Michael Shermer is the publisher of Skeptic magazine, which looks at social and scientific disagreements. He said the Doomsday clock's time does not reflect the progress made in the last 50 years. There are far fewer nuclear weapons than there were in the 1980s. Also, there has not been a war between major European countries in 70 years.


Once again she felt like a stranger in a strange land — this time missing Vietnamese pho and playing golf with friends — and once again she was keeping secrets.

## "Los Otros Dreamers"


Out of 15 random people surveyed in downtown Pittsburgh on Friday, five saw the dress as white and gold. Kiel Conjack of Freeport, Pennsylvania, thought his wife was pranking him when she said she saw blue and black.

## "I'm Right." "No, I'M Right!"


Of 100 percent of people on Yahoo Tech online poll, 29 percent were male and 35 percent were female who thought the dress was gold and white. Only 14 percent male and 16 percent female thought it was blue and black. Six percent said it was something else.

## Let's Ask Science


Espinosa, 27, was working in a bicycle shop before he was hired as a test driver two and one-half years ago. Stephanie Villegas, 28, was a swim instructor, knife sharpener and bond trader before becoming a test driver. Other test drivers are military veterans and former photographers. They all share at least one thing in common: spotless driving records.

Torcellini says getting into one of Google's driverless cars is exciting. It reminds him of scuba diving.


Besides having clean driving records, Google's test drivers say the job requires a combination of good judgment, patience and fearlessness. The self-driving cars were in 16 accidents from May 2010 through August, but accidents are becoming more frequent as the vehicles spend more time on public roads. Half of the collisions have happened since February — a stretch when the self-driving cars were traveling an average of about 10,000 miles per week on public streets in autonomous mode. There have been no major injuries reported so far.

Google says none of the accidents so far were caused by driverless cars. In most cases the driverless cars were hit from behind by other cars. Google says the crashes were caused by drivers who were not paying attention. They were too busy texting or talking on the phone.


Watching a flying demonstration on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the Missouri farmer envisions using an unmanned aerial vehicle to monitor the irrigation pipes on his farm — a job he now pays three men to do.

The small machine might look like a toy airplane, but Geske does not want to play with it. He thinks the drone could help him run his farm.


There's the Parrot AR 2.0, for sale by Amazon for $394.95, but available for $299 if you buy it from Verizon, and use your Verizon smartphone to fly it.

The newspaper USA Today called the DJI Phantom 2 Vision drone a top holiday gift for 2014. The Phantom 2 Vision has four propellors and a high-quality camera. It sells for $1,200.


Old-fashioned radio-controlled planes "are great, but you need a lot of space. A small quadcopter you can fly around your house," said Powley, who in fact does fly his drones around his house and office. "Also you can fly with first-person video, so it looks like you're inside it. That's really cool."

"It's confusing," said Wells C. Bennett, who studies drones at the Brookings Institution. "A lot of the laws will change over the next couple of years."


Lighter equipment and better batteries also mean that drones in the near future will fly higher, farther and faster than anything available commercially today.

## Low Battery? Dropping Drone


Jeff Leake, director of business development for IRcameras, a Texas company that builds high-resolution infrared video cameras, licked his lips in front of a camera to show how they turned fuchsia pink on a screen. He pointed out footprints on the screen from people walking past.

## Stored In A Backpack


In one room, Lt. Gen. James Barclay, the Army's head of force development, recalled how the Army was initially reluctant to even conduct research about using drones.

Richard Becker spun a computer ball in the booth for Corsair Engineering and hit a button. The screen showed a small, gray drone flying over a rocky valley in Afghanistan. A thin column of smoke could be seen at the end of a box canyon. "All this is exactly as you would see in real life," he said.


"Every time there's a report of a drone almost hitting a plane, that's not good for us because the regulations aren't finalized yet," Fiene said.

Andrew Moore is with the National Agricultural Aviation Association. He said pilots have a hard time seeing small drones.


"There are a lot of fail-safes that help avoid most crash situations. And if a drone does go down, you can find it based on the last GPS location," Fiene said.

"It's a blast. I think everybody wants to fly," Sellnow said.

But in 2012, Congress gave the FAA three years to come up with a plan to safely integrate commercial drones into the national airspace system. The FAA thus far has staked out testing sites to evaluate drone safety, and last month it authorized six filmmaking companies to use unmanned aircraft.

So far, the FAA has mainly allowed police and research groups to use drones. It hasn't given out many permits to businesses that want to use the unmanned aircraft.


"The delays we face are getting to the site after a catastrophe," Swain said. "Obviously, because of the damage, it's hard to get boots on the ground. This is more economical, it's more efficient, it's cheaper."

"Anywhere where you think you need to see something from high up, it's going to be not only cheaper but safer," Cummings said.


This isn't a new effort from the insurance carrier; it's been working on a testing proposal for the FAA since 2010. And it's not alone.

## Send In The Drones!


Other drone-filmed videos are also popping up that show sporting events, local beaches and even DUI checkpoints.

Recently, people began using them to make videos. YouTube is filled with videos of Yosemite National Park taken with drones. Last month, rangers said that people cannot fly drones in the park. At the Grand Canyon recently, a drone crashed. No one was hurt. But it really surprised visitors who were watching the sunset.


The FAA estimated in a report that there could be 7,500 civilian hobbyist drones in use within five years. Federal officials said they hope to craft clearer civilian drone rules by 2015, but some experts said that's too optimistic a timeline.

## A Drone Seized At Mount Rushmore


In Connecticut, a man flying a drone over a beach was attacked by a woman who accused him of trying to take pictures of her.

In April, a drone buzzed over a herd of sheep at a national park in Utah. The drone separated the adults from the lambs.


—A drone appeared about 200 feet from the left wing of a reconnaissance aircraft near Milford, California, on June 29. The firefighter pilot, who was about 1,500 feet above ground, left the area and was ordered to return to base.

An airplane spotted a drone on July 11. Pat McCabe is with the U.S. Forest Service. he was seated next to the pilot. McCabe saw the drone land about 3 miles from the fire. It was loaded onto an SUV. Its driver sped away.


Most seem delighted by the visiting black bears — many brown and cinnamon in color — lumbering through grasslands, trotting across roads or wading through rivers.

"He didn't care about me at all," Haws said. "I didn't smell like a muffin — yet."


One resident suggested on a town Facebook forum that people with guests seeking bears not bother winding up the road to the park. Others chimed in with suggestions of where to find them.

There is plenty of water in towns and acorns cover the ground.


Bears have climbed on roofs for acorns and one was found exploring a bathroom under renovation in a house. A bear tore apart the outer walls of a resident's pump house and a music studio to get at acorns a woodpecker had stowed in the siding.

"The park is upon us now," he said.


The Kaweah Commonwealth reported that bears have been illegally slaughtered, but game wardens dismissed it as far-fetched because of a lack of evidence, such as names of suspects, vehicle descriptions or dead bears, Lieutenant Doug Barnhart said.

"People are shooting the bears, there's no doubt," he said.


Darrell Fleeman was so disgusted with the story that he yanked his auto repair shop ad from the newspaper.

Darrell Fleeman does not believe bears are being killed.


In Three Rivers, bears have knocked over plenty of garbage cans and raided fruit trees and grape vines.

## Bears Need To Hibernate


Now, almost 40 years after first-term Governor Jerry Brown chastised officials for filling the lake "while others use buckets to collect water in their showers," Mission Viejo is under scrutiny again as the state struggles through another relentless drought. In California's third consecutive drought year, state officials are beginning to consider whether the sparkling waters that are the city's recreational haven might be better used to fill bathtubs and drinking glasses in the most parched regions.

The lake is not open to the public. It is owned and operated by the Lake Mission Viejo Association. To use it, one must join the association and pay dues of more than $200 a year. The association now includes more than 24,000 households.


Even officials in the Southland area lambasted the lake project. In a 1977 Times story, a Southern California water department head said he would "withhold any blessing" of it.

## So Far, It's Hands Off The Lake


A disproportionate amount of the nation's fruits and vegetables are grown in California, which ranks as the top producer of a number of popular foods.

In 2014, a lack of rain forced California farmers to stop using 500,000 acres of land. Farmers did not plant on the land to let it rest and soak up more water. Having too many trees or bushes on it would dry it out more. The roots from the plants would soak up the water from the soil. The farmers would also want to water their crops to keep them alive.


California is not new to droughts. The state has gone through several periods of drought in recent decades, said Thomas Harter, a faculty member in the department of land, air and water resources at UC Davis.

## Not Enough Snow To Melt


But this drought has been longer than most, and the state has taken to using groundwater resources, which are harder to replenish.

Dry weather is nothing new for California. Thomas Harter, who teaches at the University of California in Davis, says the state has gone through several dry years lately.


"Nurseries and seed companies had a huge influence on California landscapes," Mickey said.

"We have to give them some different opportunities," Carson said.


Lawns met with some disfavor in the drought of the late 1970s, when a small minority of homeowners let their grass die and filled their yards with gravel in a landscape more common to Phoenix or Albuquerque. But the notion never caught on in Sacramento in a big way. Other homeowners planted vegetable gardens and fruit trees, opting to make their yards productive instead of ornamental.

"It really took off when people had the money to move to the suburbs," Mickey said. "Real estate agents would say, 'Now you can have a lawn.'"


James agreed, saying Monday: "Much respect to him and he deserves it. He had a big-time MVP season."

"When you've got people behind you," Durant said, "you can do whatever" you set out to do.


The rest was silence.

Nineteen hours later, she radioed, "We are circling but cannot see island, cannot hear you." Messages continued for more than an hour before Earhart gave her location: "We are on the line of position 157 dash 337. … We are now running north and south."


Kilts said a Micronesian tribesman living on Gardner told him that when the Micronesians moved onto the island in 1938, they found a partial human skeleton, along with a woman's shoe — a sign that she was a foreigner, since the tribesmen all went barefoot. The remnants of a fire pit nearby contained burned bones of small birds and fish, which suggested the woman had lived there some time.

Gillespie thinks Earhart landed her plane on a coral reef off Gardner Island and radioed for help.


Researchers examined tiny grains of the mineral zircon from western Australia's Jack Hills and chemically dated them to when Earth was barely 400 million years old. Inside one of the 160-some grains they found what they call a "chemo-fossil," or a certain mix of carbon isotopes, according to a study published Oct. 19 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

## Life's Gooey Leftovers


The discovery marks a milestone in the quest to find planets that are not just Earth-size, but truly Earth-like, said Doug Hudgins, NASA's program scientist for the Kepler mission in Washington.

"This is a historic discovery of the first Earth-size planet found in the habitable zone around its star," astronomer Geoffrey Marcy commented. "This is the best case for a habitable planet yet found. The results are absolutely rock solid."


"Whether we are an extremely rare fluke — a phenomenon that only happens once in a universe — or in a galaxy teeming with life is a very basic question not only of science, but of our existence," said Dimitar Sasselov, a planetary astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who was not involved in the paper. It's "the first time in human history we have a good shot at answering that question, and that's very exciting."

"I believe that planets are very" varied, said astrophysicist Sara Seager. "A whole range of them could be habitable."


Soil also plays a role in whether a building survives an earthquake — its composition, the grain size, how densely packed it is and how much water it's holding.

They did not even think of turning back. The aftershock gave them the chance to see the damage just hours after a major earthquake hit.


Following the hypothesis, as is the case for other organisms, that the greatest genetic diversity would be found in the geographical origin of a species, scientists found that this locale was southern East Asia for dogs. Then, after calculating how long it takes for a certain number of mutations to appear in the genome, they determined that the split between gray wolves and southern East Asian dogs occurred 33,000 years in the past.

## How Did Dogs Break From Wolves?


The folks behind Big Livestock, like their climate change-denying colleagues in the fossil fuel industry, have mounted an aggressively deceptive campaign against their critics.

## Melting Icecaps, Dry Riverbeds


A blueprint to achieve the meat tax is laid out in a November report by Chatham House, a London-based think tank. The group concedes that the issue is "complex."

We can all make that small sacrifice. It is easy to do and will help save our planet.


According to a recent study from the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems, "An iso-caloric shift from the current average U.S. diet to USDA dietary recommendations could result in a 12 percent increase in diet-related GHG emissions, whereas a shift that includes a decrease in caloric intake, based on the needs of the population — assuming moderate activity, results in a small, 1 percent decrease in diet-related GHG emissions."

Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University looked at just that question. They found that a shift toward eating more fruits and vegetables would actually raise the amount of greenhouse gas released. 


Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the second phase of the apartment cleanup has been completed, including disposal of most of Duncan's personal items, which could be infectious.

## Texas Governor Agrees With Screenings


Saturday's attack on a team trying to bury five dead followed several attacks on health workers in neighboring Guinea, including one case last week in which eight members of a health delegation were killed by villagers. The Sierra Leone team eventually did manage to bury the five bodies with the help of a police escort.

## Most People Stayed Home


"On the whole we came out successful. We feel confident that the initial problems we encountered have been slashed," he said.

"It has been our experience that lockdowns and quarantines do not help control Ebola," the charity group Doctors Without Borders said. Quarantines lead to families hiding people who might have Ebola. It "ends up spreading the disease further."


Sacra says he doesn't regret a thing. "Some risks are worth taking," he says. "Even if I had died due to Ebola last year, I would not have changed what I did."

"I'm doing fine," he said.


Many Liberians who stayed away from hospitals at the peak of the epidemic are just starting to return with serious chronic ailments such as heart disease and AIDS, he says, pushing already strained health care facilities beyond capacity.

## Disease Is Under Control


"What? No, that worries me," Lisa Jackson told a reporter while sitting at a nearby bus stop. "Why are they bringing them here? They shouldn't even let them across the border," she said, shaking her head.

Alexis Walker praised Emory and the CDC for the transfer. "It's good to know when someone needs help and medical care, there's someplace they can go," Walker said.


The incubation period for the disease can last from two to 21 days and only then do people become symptomatic and contagious. Yet it's evident that the disease can be contained. Already Senegal and Nigeria appear to have quelled the spread of Ebola. But other factors could exacerbate the threat if the disease is not completely contained soon: No one has studied how long Ebola immunity lasts, so although the assumption has been that immunity will last for several years it's possible that, for example, recovered patients may get ill again next year.

## It Could Spread For Years


On a more general level, he also notes that, although unlikely to occur, it is possible that a few mutations in important locations could substantially affect Ebola virus properties and render all the candidate vaccines ineffective—even if the overall mutation rate is relatively slow. "The availability of a good and safe vaccine would make an immense difference. We are going to see future outbreaks of Ebola. Once this one is over we have it in animal reservoirs so there will be additional outbreaks in the future," says Keiji Fukuda, the assistant director general for health security at the World Health Organization (WHO). Even if one drug does get approval, he says, that does not mean progress on other formulations should stop. "If we have the luxury of having multiple products to look at and evaluate, then so much the better. There are safety considerations, effectiveness, cost—all of these things are important," he says.

This new snapshot of Ebola showed that there were surprisingly few differences. The changes mostly appeared to be minor. In fact, the researchers calculated that there was little change in the mutation rate between Ebola now and in earlier outbreaks.


New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and Dr. Mary Bassett, the city's health commissioner, assured New Yorkers that Spencer did not become symptomatic until Thursday morning and that he was not contagious during his outings earlier in the week.

Ebola was too serious to trust people to voluntarily quarantine themselves, said New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo.


Many others were not reassured. Some echoed lawmakers' calls in Washington for a ban on people arriving from West Africa, where Ebola is suspected in more than 4,800 deaths.

Pedro Vanegas lives and works across the street from the apartment building and said he was not worried.


"I don't like the idea that the country is letting people come and go from these West African countries like normal," said Kenneth Clarke, 45, who lives in the neighborhood. "How many more people like him are walking around?"

"The truth is that I was surprised and worried when I found out last night," Vanegas said. "But I think the government is doing the best they can. They started cleaning the apartment immediately."


The aid group alerted city health officials to Spencer's fever. The health department sent emergency medical services workers in full protective gear to Spencer's apartment.

## Mayor Takes A Subway Ride


Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said the health care worker had "extensive contact" with Duncan. The nurse, who missed two days of work before going to the emergency room, is believed to have had contact with one person while symptomatic. Ebola, which is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids of a sick person, can be transmitted only by infected people showing symptoms.

Frieden said CDC officials have spoken with the nurse. She was not sure how she may have caught Ebola.


"We have been preparing for an event like this," Lakey said.

Frieden said a person can get Ebola from even a single accidental slipup. "Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola" in health care workers, he said.


Dina Smith was holding her 3-year-old daughter, still in disbelief that the first contracted case was just a block away.

Lindsey Carpenter said news helicopters flew over her neighborhood Sunday morning. "There's an Ebola patient in the neighborhood," her roommate told her.


Henry Johnson heard the news while watching TV in the hospital's emergency room with his wife, who was waiting to be treated for a headache. The Dallas resident said the crowded room watched closely and remained calm.

## "We Will Stop It Here"


But Johnson said he was worried about the people who were in the ER on Friday, as well as those who might have been exposed to Ebola after hospital staff let the patient leave.

"I have no doubt that we will control this importation of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country," Dr. Tom Frieden said. He is the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "We will stop it here."


"Have they cleaned the whole hospital?" she wondered aloud.

Dr. David Lakey is the top official of the Texas Department of State Health Services. He said he thinks the man is the only person with Ebola in Texas.


Officials would not say which flights the patient took from Liberia, one of the three African nations now battling the worst Ebola epidemic in history. But Frieden said other passengers on the aircraft would not have been at risk because the patient was asymptomatic at the time.

"We have the ability to trace contacts, monitor people and to act quickly if any of them should start to exhibit symptoms," Rimoin said. If West African nations had these systems, "there wouldn't be this huge outbreak in the first place," she said.


British military engineers and medical experts will build and operate a 62-bed care facility near the Sierra Leone capital, Freetown, the British Department for International Development said Monday.

President Barack Obama is sending U.S. military troops and equipment. The soldiers will help set up isolation units. The units will keep people with Ebola completely separate to prevent the disease from spreading.


Staffed by local and international personnel, it will include a 12-bed center providing specialist care for health workers to "ensure they can continue to respond to the disease as safely and efficiently as possible," it said in a statement.
Army Colonel Steve Warren is a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense. The troops will build a 25-bed hospital in Monrovia to care for health workers. Monrovia is the capital of Liberia.


Attendance at Lake Pointe Elementary in the Eagle-Mountain Saginaw school district dropped significantly after parents were notified Wednesday night that a student had been placed in voluntary isolation. The student's father, a Marine stationed at Naval Air Station Fort Worth, was on a Frontier Airlines flight with infected health care worker Amber Joy Vinson.

The schools continued their battle against the virus Friday. Workers used cleaning products to disinfect schools. The schools made sure students who were absent were not coming back to school sick.


"It reassured me that that it is OK, that he can go back to school," Kennedy said. "And if he did come into contact with that student, the damage is done. I hope they do keep us informed, keep up with the phone calls and notices, because communication is key in this."

"It is the first time it really got real for our community," said Kristin Courtney, spokeswoman for the school district. "And our community needed some time to process the information."


He said he was disappointed to learn of schools closing in various parts of Texas, where children and parents of children had possible contact with someone infected with Ebola.

"It reassured me that that it is OK, that he can go back to school," Kennedy said. "And if he did come into contact with that student, the damage is done. I hope they do keep us informed, keep up with the phone calls and notices, because communication is key in this."


He said some workers at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas told him that their children were being advised to stay away from day care facilities.

Chelsea Salas is the mother of a first-grader. She said that she and her husband decided to send their daughter to school.


Jenkins defended those who have been on the front line in the fight against Ebola, and since Day One has been working to educate the public about the virus.

## Keep Calm, Judge Says


In the Highland Park school district in Dallas, Superintendent Dawson Orr posted a message Friday on its website, explaining that all campuses will be cleaned over the weekend and that the custodial staff will step up cleaning during the school day.

Jenkins said some hospital workers were being treated unfairly. They told him that their children were being told to stay away from day care.


The Fort Worth school district is also trying to dispel rumors, said Clint Bond, director of communication for the district, despite not having any reported exposure to Ebola.

Workers who do not have symptoms have "zero" chance of spreading Ebola, Jenkins said.


"There have been rumors within the general community we have been made of aware of, not confined to just the school district, and we have done our best to squelch those," he said in an email.

## Spreading The Word


As precautions, Bond said, they have re-emphasized infectious disease protocols with school nurses and have talked with Dallas school district on their experiences and "lessons learned."

Highland Park school district Superintendent Dawson Orr posted a message Friday on the district website. He explained that all schools will be cleaned over the weekend. Cleaning will also be increased during the school day.


"We are scared by the situation prevailing in that zone," the Togolese federation said, adding it would follow advice from its government, which would likely prevent the party traveling to Guinea.

## Togo Not Endangering Its Players


Funding for the CDC's climate change and chronic disease programs, which aim to prevent smoking, alcohol consumption and poor diets, received $6.5 billion over that same time.

The CDC has a program to limit climate change. It has another to deal with ongoing health problems — preventing smoking, alcohol abuse and poor diets. Together those programs receive about $1.6 billion a year.


The Associated Press recently obtained a leaked private WHO document admitting that "nearly everyone involved in the outbreak response failed to see some fairly plain writing on the wall."

## "Didn't Do Anything"


The CDC responded quickly, providing such resources as epidemic intelligence officers and public health advisers for contact tracing. It also provided hospital infection control procedures, detailed Ebola screening checklists, laboratory precautions, quarantine protocols and is now managing the airport screening processes.

## Blaming The Government


As Ebola was emerging in West Africa, CDC epidemiologists were soon on the ground there investigating. As ours and other governments have slowly become more engaged, CDC could increase important human resources for West Africa: hundreds of epidemiologists, health educators and public health advisers.

We fail to notice that measles outbreaks in schools are quickly handled, thanks to local public health departments; or the progress made in reducing infections patients catch at hospitals.

Have we? No. We've just complained and made demands to close our borders. Those actions will likely make it harder to stop Ebola.


Rather than just invoking the name of "national security" and moving on, the White House should have classified the initiative correctly — as a humanitarian mission — and explained the rationale for this auxiliary mission to the American people.

They understand the danger. They accept that as part of the job.


That assessment came before the president announced plans to send 4,000 soldiers to West Africa, a number sure to grow given the president's recent authorization of a National Guard call-up. It was also before military operations were launched against the extremist group Islamic State, a campaign that may ultimately require ground forces.

Our military is already taking on too much. The president has decided to cut the Army from 570,000 soldiers to 440,000. The administration's Quadrennial Defense Review said this "strains our ability" to respond to more than one major problem at a time.


But the backbone of the ministry's work is half-hour programs shown on public television that advocate the happy lifestyle.

## Is Well-Being A Joke?


More surprising still, school attendance averages, while widely reported, are highly misleading. A district may accurately note rates of 90 percent, but still have hundreds of students missing weeks of instruction because that number is an aggregate — concealing the fact that different students are absent on different days.

"That has been proven for all kids," Balfanz said. He does research at John Hopkins University in Baltimore.


This finding inspired Balfanz to create the anti-dropout program Diplomas Now, which sends dozens of recent college graduates into middle schools with a laser focus on attendance and tutoring. At Denny International and Aki Kurose in Seattle, both of which have long struggled with student discipline and lackluster scores, it is making a dramatic difference.

There is no magic to Diplomas Now. Kids learn best when they feel people care about them.


"The unexcused absence rate was ridiculous," agreed Principal Mia Williams, who arrived in 2008 and quickly grasped the severity of the problem.

Before, no one was paying attention to a lot of the kids, said Katrina Hunt. She is the Diplomas Now coordinator at Aki Kurose. "We never had any single person following them."


In 2010, Williams and Jeff Clark, the principal at Denny, flew to Chicago to see Diplomas Now in action.

No one woke him up in the morning, Hunt learned. He showed up at school only four days out of every five. The rest of the time he came to school late.


"Instead, parents, teachers, and state and local education leaders will regain control of their schools," said Kline, part of the bipartisan quartet that spearheaded the bill.

No Child was too standardized, the president said. All schools had to follow the same rules, no matter how different their students were.


## Parents

## An Equal Education For All Children


"But the real crime, which needs to be prosecuted, is the glaring inequity in the quality of schools in rich areas versus poor ones," he said.

The local prosecutor, Risa Vetri Ferman, said the Garcias were never truly separated. She said they always lived in northwestern Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where many of the schools are struggling. They lied to gain entry into the Lower Moreland schools, she said.


They "essentially stole from every hard-working taxpayer who resides within the Lower Moreland School District," Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told reporters.

## Spying On The Nanny's Child


In 2011, Kelley Williams-Bolar, a special education aide in Akron, Ohio, was convicted of records tampering and spent nine days in jail for sending her two daughters to a school in the high-performing school district where her father lived.

At a school district in Orinda, California, officials hired an investigator to spy on a 7-year-old girl. The girl's mother works as a live-in nanny and cares for other people's children. Officials suspected the mother lived in another town.


Jimmie Mesis, the founder of VerifyResidence.com, a New Jersey-based private investigating firm that launched locally in 2000, says he has expanded across the country and now works with more than 200 districts on enrollment issues and residency fraud.

Romero says many parents aren't aware of the law.


"It's a 'gotcha' thing," said Gwen Samuel, the founder of the Connecticut Parents Union, which has helped to support a handful of families that have been criminally charged for enrollment fraud and other related offenses. "What's troubling now is the length that districts are willing to go. You see residency officers more than ever and this practice of treating families like they've robbed a bank. It has become the norm to treat them like criminals."

"The real issue is how do we provide quality schools for all children," said Ryan Smith, head of an education group.

"In Alabama, consumers are free to make their own choice of which eggs to buy at their grocery stores, and it is preposterous and quite simply wrong for California to tell Alabama how we must produce eggs," Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange said in a statement. "If California can get away with this, it won't be long before the environmentalists in California tell us how we must build cars, grow crops, and raise cattle, too."

"We think that California is dead wrong on this," said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad. Iowa produces the most eggs in America.


"That's the person who doesn't get a voice," he said.

The European Union banned battery cages in 1999. They gave farmers 12 years to get rid of them and buy bigger cages.


Plus, said Hurst, it's not hard to imagine other states taking protectionist steps. Missouri grows grapes without irrigation for wine, for example. It might decide to prohibit imports of wine from grapes grown with irrigation, as in California, he said.

People "are demanding higher animal welfare," said Joe Maxwell. Animal welfare is how an animal is treated. Maxwell is a farmer who helps run the Humane Society, an animal-rights group.


"It's a sea change," said Jill Benson, a fourth-generation egg farmer in Modesto, California, who started researching cages soon after Proposition 2 passed. Her family company, JS West &amp; Companies, became the first in the country to choose "enriched colony" cages. These are the standard in the EU and are approved by the American Humane Association, a different group from the Humane Society of the United States.

Dermot Hayes is a professor at Iowa State University. Hayes estimates that 40 percent of the laying hens in Iowa will be killed so farmers can make room in their henhouses for the bigger cages.


More than 53,000 birds in Missouri and 40,000 birds in Arkansas have been affected. In Kansas, the virus has hit only 10 birds in a backyard flock. Despite the relatively small outbreak, last week the Kansas Department of Agriculture banned chickens, turkeys and other live birds from appearing in state and county fairs in 2015 for fear of spreading the virus.

## Millions Of Hens Lost


"Prior to this outbreak, eggs were on a roll," Kevin Burkum, senior vice president of marketing at the American Egg Board.

The outbreaks have meant that there are less eggs. Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicted that 95.9 billion eggs will be laid this year, while nearly 100 billion eggs were produced last year.


Roxanne's, probably like many cafes, is trying to compensate for high egg prices. In addition to portion control in her egg-heavy meals, owner Gray changed the daily specials to include meals that don't include eggs, such as goulash and catfish. She hasn't offered lemon meringue pie in two weeks. Her cooks may begin cracking eggs over the stove per omelet instead of cracking eggs into a bucket each morning.

Before the outbreak "eggs were on a roll," Kevin Burkum, an official with the American Egg Board. The group promotes eggs and egg farmers.


Hen House said its cost has gone up about 40 percent in the last couple of weeks, and it has had to pass some of that on to consumers. Its suppliers have also asked the grocery store chain not to run egg promotions that could increase demand.

Heat kills the virus. Outbreaks are expected to slow down in the summer.


O'Hayer, a youthful 59-year-old with bright blue eyes and a permanent tan, calls himself a serial entrepreneur — and this isn't his first time in the egg business. In 1968, when he was in junior high school, he delivered eggs to friends and neighbors in Providence, Rhode Island, a job that earned him more than his previous six-day-a-week paper route had.

## Give A Hen Some Space


Casualty figures were not immediately available, but Muslim Brotherhood officials said many people were killed and hundreds wounded. They called upon their supporters to donate blood and rush to the Nasr district of Cairo to assist the victims. "Bloodbath!" tweeted Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad Haddad.

Morsi was pushed out of office by the army on Wednesday. He is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood party, which wants the Muslim religion to play a greater role in Egyptian life. Before his removal, Egypt had been struggling to maintain a fragile new democracy. Two and a half years ago Egypt's longtime dictator, President Hosni Mubarak, was overthrown by the people. Mubarak had ruled for 30 years. The military took over the country while elections were being prepared. Morsi was elected president one year ago.


El-Din is seen as a less divisive choice than secular opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, whose nomination was abruptly blocked a day earlier.

## Bloodbath In The Streets


Under the latest scenario, ElBaradei would become vice president, Ahram reported. El-Din and interim government officials cautioned that no final decision has been made.

Brotherhood officials reported that many people were killed and hundreds hurt during the protest. They asked supporters to donate blood and to rush to help the victims. "Bloodbath!" tweeted Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Gehad Haddad.


Among those who accepted a post was Nobel laureate and Morsi opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, whom Mansour named as vice president. ElBaradei resigned Wednesday. In his resignation letter, he referred to the divisive nature of the new government and suggested that the civilians weren't in control.

ElBaradei resigned Wednesday. In his resignation letter, he referred to the quarreling nature of the new government. He suggested that the people weren't in control.


Negotiations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the military to end the impasse began earlier this month, led by international and domestic mediators. Nadar Bakkar, a spokesman for the conservative Nour Party who participated in the discussion, said the talks had failed in part because it was unclear who was in charge.

## Bloody End To Talks


Even when he died at the age of 76, Einstein's corpus callosum was a veritable superhighway of connectivity, researchers reported this week in the journal Brain. Not only was it "thicker in the vast majority of subregions" than the corpora callosa of 15 elderly healthy males; it was also thicker at five key crossings than those of 52 young, healthy males in the prime of their lives.

## The Man Who Removed Einstein's Brain


Recognizing the formidable challenge imposed on industry, the federal government and the states enacted generous subsidies for the nascent electric vehicle industry — the battery suppliers, vehicle manufacturers, recharging companies and consumers.

However, based on hard work that began four years ago, the second generation of plug-in vehicles is about to hit vehicle showrooms, as every auto maker from Toyota to Volkswagen will be offering some form of plug-in vehicle.

President Obama's goal of one million plug-in vehicles in the U.S. by 2015 was too hopeful, and it won't happen in time.


The lecture speaker mentioned that elephants seemed to have extra copies of the p53 gene. Schiffman's patients include children with incomplete p53 genes because of a condition called Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which greatly increases their chances of developing cancer. So Schiffman sought to find clues from the blood of eight elephants, Ringling Bros. circus animals and local zoo animals.

## Bigger Animals, But Smaller Cancer Rates


Dr. Judy Garber, director of cancer genetics and prevention at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said the research is intriguing but preliminary.

## One Cancer-Fighting Gene Per Cell For Humans — 20 For Elephants


This team inserted elephants' p53 genes into mouse cells and found that those cells behaved just like elephants and self-destructed when exposed to DNA-damaging drugs, said co-author Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago. His study is under review for publication and was released online this week.

Doctor Joshua Schiffman led one of the two teams. He and his team took a bit of blood from eight elephants, without hurting them. The elephants belong to a circus and a zoo.


The process is still experimental but considered promising by international elephant conservation groups who last Tuesday celebrated World Elephant Day to draw attention to the plight of wild elephants.

## Project Frozen Dumbo


Project Frozen Dumbo is a partnership among the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, the Pittsburgh Zoo, the Vienna Zoo and ZooParc de Beauval in France. It originated through discussions between Barbara Baker, president and CEO of the Pittsburgh Zoo, and Thomas Hildebrandt, a reproductive specialist at the Leibniz Institute.

Now, there is good news. Two baby elephants have been born in zoos in Austria and England.


"This has been done in other species, but never before in elephants," said the foundation's executive director, Deborah Olson. She was not involved in the expedition but assisted the Pittsburgh Zoo in an unsuccessful attempt to ship the frozen semen from France to the United States for use in American zoos.

Willie Theison runs the Pittsburgh Zoo's elephant program. He said the news of the births was huge.


"They're very capable, but very complex to operate," said Justin Manley, an MIT-trained ocean engineer who piloted the same cutting-edge ROV, called a CURV 21, for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration when it mapped the Titanic, perhaps history's most famous shipwreck, in the icy North Atlantic 12,500 feet down.

Investigators are using a submersible to explore the shipwreck. A submersible is a vehicle that can go deep underwater. No one is inside the vehicle. Pilots up above the water steer the vehicle down below. Investigators hope the submersible will uncover clues about why the ship sank last month.


Its long-distance, or teleconnected, effects are so great that some researchers argue it doubles the risk of war in much of the Third World.

## Californians Eager For El Nino


In fact, a series of catastrophic famines that killed more than 30 million people in India and China in the late 19th century caused researchers to first take note of the phenomenon we now call El Nino.

## U.N. Says We Are Better Prepared Than Ever


From 2005 through 2013, 6,424 snakebites were reported in Costa Rica. The scientists found that the rate of snakebites surged during the hot phase of El Nino, which is probably because snakes become more active and might wander farther as it gets warmer, perhaps running into humans in the process.

Snakes are coldblooded. This means the air around them controls their body temperature. For humans, our body controls the temperature of our bodies.


Three consecutive presidents of El Salvador have now enforced the de facto moratorium on mining, and the anti-mining cause has gained the support of the Roman Catholic Church and global activist groups with clout, such as Oxfam.

OceanaGold says people should not worry about its mining. It says it can mine for gold without poisoning the water supply.


Opposition to the mine has brought fame to Pineda, the agronomist who leads the Environmental Committee of Cabanas, the main opposition. In 2011, he won the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, worth $175,000, which is presented each year for what the prize website calls grass-roots environmentalism. President Barack Obama invited Pineda to a White House meeting.

"Let them come here," said Gilberto Vasquez Ramos, a city council member. The mining might cause some damage, he admitted. If that happens, however, the company can make up for it by paying a fine.


"Let them come here and invest," said Gilberto Vasquez Ramos, a city council member. "Yes, it might damage the environment a little bit, but the government can regulate this. If they do damage, they'll have to pay the fine."

The big question, Parada said, is whether a foreign company should have to follow the current laws of the country in which it is operating. Or, should a company have to change its laws to satisfy a foreign company?


"This is a good indication of why they're so important," Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."

 "There's no indication, unless I'm proved wrong later, that that program ... contributed to information about this particular plot," Schiff said.


Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a leading critic of the NSA surveillance, took the opposing position on CNN, saying the program that has raised the most opposition in Congress, the daily collection of cellphone metadata that detail numbers called, the calls' origins and the length of calls, appears to have had nothing to do with either the closing of the U.S. embassies or the travel advisory.

There were no reports of unusual activity Sunday in any of the countries where U.S. embassies were kept closed.


Graham, however, seemed to indicate that the fight to curb the NSA programs is likely to be fierce.

"Do we need to collect all of the phone records of all of the people living in America for five years" to be ready to target one person?  Democtratic Sen. Richard Durbin said on NBC's "Meet the Press."


Overall, the challenge aims to develop versatile machines that can be deployed during any emergency and present a very short learning curve for operators. "Fukushima was really a great inspiration for us because we don't know what the next disaster is going to be, but we know that we have to develop technology to help us to address these kinds of disasters," Gill Pratt, DARPA program manager for the competition, said Wednesday during a press conference. Earlier intervention — while keeping responders at a safe distance — could help keep future disasters from escalating as Fukushima did, he added.

## In Over Their Remote-Controlled Heads


States across the South were locked in a bitter battle over voting rights and school desegregation. White Southerners, bombarded with calls for desegregation, felt their way of life was threatened. Poor whites, including shopkeepers who served even poorer black communities, believed racial equality would come at their expense.

"The Postal Service has far too little flexibility when it needs to adjust, and it's really in handcuffs because of all the requirements Congress puts on it," Schuyler said.

"We are in real trouble," Mickey Barnett, chairman of the Postal Service Board of Governors, told Congress last month. The board of governors is like a board of directors at a private company. It chooses the postmaster general.


The pre-funding payments and other measures in the 2006 law have led some, including political activist Ralph Nader, to call the Postal Service's situation a "manufactured crisis." Only one other federal agency, the Defense Department, pre-funds future retiree health benefits, the Government Accountability Office said.

Kelley said the new regulations would "increase the protection of eagles and will help develop more wind farms, a leading solution to [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming), which is the No. 1 threat to all eagles and all wildlife."

"It's outrageous that the government is sanctioning the killing of America's symbol, the bald eagle," David Yarnold said. He is president of the National Audubon Society, a conservation organization that focuses on birds.


"Renewable energy development is vitally important to our nation's future, but it has to be done the right way," she said in a statement. "The changes in this permitting program will help the renewable energy industry and others develop projects that can operate in the longer term, while ensuring bald and golden eagles continue to thrive for generations."

The government began handing out permits to wind farms in 2009. The permits allowed for the accidental killing of bald and golden eagles, which are protected by the government.

Air conditioning may be considered a boon in the United States, making livable Florida's tropical summers and cooling the blazing heat that often reaches into the triple digits in Texas or California's Central Valley. And it may have set off office battles in the United States between men and women over what the proper temperatures should be.

In Norway's capital, Oslo, a city just about as far north as Anchorage and where the sun these days is rising after 9 a.m. and setting just after 3 p.m., the city council has been talking about banning cars from downtown. The idea is that even in a country that relies on oil revenue for wealth and has a surplus of electrical power, the bike should be the default mode of transport.

Last year, the city decided to make it easier to bike in Berlin. Officials spent $16 million on bike lanes and bike traffic signals. Bike lanes and traffic signals help make biking safer.


Goessling argues that the social benefits of cycling amount to 28 cents a mile in savings on health care and other services, while each car mile costs society 27 cents in road deterioration, energy and the lost time of commuters.

Thirteen bodies were recovered and nine men were rescued, but three sherpas, including Galden's close friend, Ash Bahadur Gurung, remained unaccounted for. With conditions worsening and the thin air making it dangerous for helicopters to fly, the search was called off.

The next morning, Galden flew down the mountain in a helicopter. He hiked a short distance and found the bodies of avalanche victims buried in the snow. Using different tools, he helped dig the men out of the snow. Many of the men died in the avalanche. Galden was heartbroken when he recognized the face of a friend.


Biologists have long debated whether bigger is better.

Scientists say they have proved an important idea in evolution.


"There has been this open question of whether animals get bigger, over time — but there's been a lack of data," said Heim, a postdoctoral researcher in paleontologist Payne's lab at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Systems.

Over the past 542 million years, sea (marine) animals have gotten 150 times larger, Payne and Heim said. They reported their work in the magazine Science.


They didn't study why being big bestows such an advantage. Maybe it's harder for anything else to eat them. Perhaps mates find them more attractive. Or they could be better equipped to fight off competitors.

Animals didn't get steadily larger over time. Instead, bigger animals usually push out smaller ones and take over and breed together, the scientists found.


Not all animal lovers want cats, dogs or fish. So Averso has made his 1,200-square-foot shop on Union Street the go-to place for North Jerseyans who want the pricier writhing reptiles, gliding marsupials or hairless rats to be a part of their lives.

## Deep Pockets? Try A Pocket Pet!


"I first came here looking for ferrets and ended up falling in love with reptiles," said Firestone, gazing at the leucistic rat snake coiled around her wrist and forearm. When asked if she owned any reptiles, she produced a pencil-thin corn snake from a pocket in her skirt. It eats "frozen pinkies" — hairless, newborn mice.

"Wildlife belongs in the wild. It's risky for everyone involved," said Kate Dylewsky of Born Free. "It's cruel to the animals to keep them in confinement, often isolated from members of their own species. And most people don't have knowledge or the resources to care for these animals properly."

Nationally, there is no law against owning exotic animals. It is left to the states to decide.


Culver said exotic animals need to be kept in captivity so they can breed. "They are the offspring of animals that were taken out of the wild. We're morally obligated to manage them responsibly for future generations."

"Wildlife belongs in the wild. It's risky for everyone involved," said Kate Dylewsky of Born Free. "It's cruel to the animals to keep them in confinement," she said. They cannot be with others of their own kind, she said.


"It usually takes some horrible event in a state, where people say, 'How did you let this happen?' for the legislature to act," Favre said.

## Wild Animals In Ohio Town


In Connecticut, the Legislature amended its law in 2009 to ban the private ownership of some primates after an incident that year in which a woman was blinded, lost both hands and had much of her face ripped off by her friend's 200-pound pet chimp.

At the time, Ohio had no law dealing with dangerous exotic pets. After the Zanesville situation, buying exotic pets was no longer allowed, starting in 2012. People who already owned such pets were allowed to keep them. However, they had to get permits and follow safety and care rules.


Wisconsin is one of five states without a law regulating the private ownership of dangerous exotic animals, according to Born Free. Fourteen states require licenses or permits. Twelve allow ownership of some exotic animals but prohibit others. And 19 have bans on a number of species.

## Connecticut Chimp Attack


Last year, West Virginia, which had not had a law, passed a measure that prohibited private possession of lions, tigers, bears, elephants and most primates. Owners were grandfathered in, provided they are registered. The rules went into effect earlier this year.

The law in Connecticut was changed in 2009. Since then, people have not been allowed to own some primates. The law was changed after a woman was seriously injured by her friend's 200-pound pet chimp.


"When you don't have any checks and balances in place, it was wide open for people bringing these exotic animals into our little state," said former Democratic Delegate Randy Swartzmiller, who introduced the bill. "The majority of the Legislature saw this as a bill that was not only going to protect people but also the well-being of these animals."

Wisconsin is one of five states with no law about people owning dangerous pets, says Born Free. Fourteen states make people get licenses or permits. Twelve allow ownership of some exotic animals but do not allow others. And 19 have do not allow several species.


"I think it really kicked into high gear after Hurricane Katrina," Nienstedt said in a telephone interview. "There was a growing awareness that some areas had a bigger need for population issues and other areas didn't; other areas had needs for adoptable pets."

It's an ancient twist to modern farming, which has embraced technology to resist disease, conserve water and conjure a smorgasbord of expensive hybrid fruit. Yet when it comes to marauding birds, growers have few solutions short of ringing the skies with shotgun blasts.

With the oldest six children grown and out of the house, 11 people cram into the three-bedroom, one-and-a-half bath apartment that the family owns in East Garfield Park.

## Musical Saturdays


"I know that music is best learned at an early age," Jonathan Kelly said. "Then it becomes something you can do your whole life. When we get together and sing and play, we do it for ourselves. If others enjoy it, that's a good thing."

"Music changes your heart and mind. It helps you find calm," Sandifer said. She believes that if children from poor areas could take music lessons, they would get into less trouble. "These kids on the streets have a gift," she said. They just need someone to help them use it.


Kelly Minter had camped with her family as a child, but she conceded that summer options like Oceans of Fun, a theme park in Kansas City, had been more appealing than the labor of preparing a campsite.

Her kids had been begging for a camping trip for a long time. The family had set one up at Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park for the end of June.


One other family was chosen to spend the night with the Minters on a recent Saturday, and any dent the program makes on an overall decline will likely be small.

Gale Strasburg is a professor of food science at Michigan State University. He is trying to develop turkeys that do well in the heat. Right now, within a day or two after a heat wave, four in 10 turkeys are suffering.


The meat industry should be more radical in confronting climate change, Miller said, pointing to an approach backed by Microsoft founder Bill Gates that takes animals out of the process altogether. The billionaire is bullish on technology that would use pea proteins to create replicas of beef and chicken that are indistinguishable from the real thing.

Strasburg is studying how turkey chicks and eggs do when the temperature is a few degrees warmer. He is trying to figure out which traits could help the animals stay alive in the heat.

On Thursday afternoon, dozens of police officers kept watch on hundreds of people gathered outside a government building. The people were waiting for news of their arrested relatives and how the talks were going.


Batters are guilty, too. Hanley Ramirez's major league-leading 28.1 seconds between pitches and Yasiel Puig's 26.7 seconds, which tied for third, contributed to Los Angeles Dodgers games averaging 3:14 this season.

Batters also slow games down. Hanley Ramirez of the Los Angeles Dodgers takes 28.1 seconds between pitches. He was the slowest batter in the major leagues this year. His teammate Yasiel Puig takes 26.7 seconds, which tied for third. Dodgers games took an average of 3:14 this season.


Detroit Tigers minor league left-hander Robbie Ray learned the hard way the consequences of the new rules on Oct. 16 when his Glendale Desert Dogs faced the Salt River Rafters. Because he did not deliver his first pitch in the bottom of the first inning before time expired, he received an automatic ball and started the at-bat with a 1-0 count.

The rules seem to have worked. Through Oct. 24, nine-inning games under the new rules averaged 2 hours, 20 minutes, while nine-inning games without clock rules averaged 2:49. The average AFL game took 2:51 last year.

A new analysis by Fed staffers said the old-fashioned greenback is more durable than people realize and replacing it with a $1 coin, which is more expensive to produce, would cost the government $1.2 billion over 30 years.

They say it would save the government money.


The Dollar Coin Alliance, a lobbying organization that includes government watchdogs, transit agencies, and mining and vending industry groups, touts an economic report that estimated a switch would save $13.8 billion over 30 years.

The study by the Fed found that the dollar bill lasts longer than people realize. And to switch it out for a dollar coin would cost the government $1.2 billion over 30 years. Coins are more expensive to produce, it pointed out.


In addition, the shift to a $1 coin would result in additional costs to banks for extra vault storage space and equipment that would be "perhaps in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year," the Fed said.

The Fed puts out money through its regional banks. And it orders it from the Treasury's printing department. The Fed said it doesn't make any profits. Every year it turns over any profits to the Treasury Department. The Treasury pays the government's bills. And it collects taxes.


The latest incarnation — coins with images of American presidents — was promoted by the Fed and the U.S. Mint, but the effort "failed to stimulate demand," the report said.

The dollar bill is made with paper that blends cotton and linen. It is now stronger than it used to be. And it lasts about 70 months, the Fed said. Paper money only lasted 18 months in 1990.


But the Dollar Coin Alliance said polls have shown about two-thirds of Americans support a switch to a $1 coin when told of potential budget savings.
A dollar bill costs about 5 cents to make. A dollar coin costs about 33 cents, the Fed said. Over 30 years, the government would spend $6.9 billion more if it replaced the bills with coins.


Yet women influence 80 percent of car buying decisions, according to "Women in Cars," a 2014 analysis by consulting firm Frost &amp; Sullivan.

## Bird Lovers Vs. Cat Lovers


Julie Wraithnell, director of wildlife conservation for Audubon Florida, calls the death toll attributable to cats "staggering."

Holtz calls TNR "the only successful approach to feral cats."


Alley Cat Allies, a national advocacy group based in Maryland, has been lobbying on behalf of TNR efforts since its founding in 1990. The organization counters that human activity such as habitat destruction has a much greater impact on bird populations than predation by cats.

## Cats Won't Go Away


"It's not as if you stop putting out bowls of food and the cats will go away," she added. "If people weren't putting out food, they would just go through the trash. We believe we should treat animals humanely, and that TNR over time will diminish the colony size."

Chagrin thinks feral cats should be put to sleep. That, she said, is kinder than returning them to a dangerous life.


Chagrin thinks euthanizing feral cats is more humane than returning them to a potentially dangerous life.

"It's never going to go away," she said, looking out over her cats. "It's not going to stop. This is still going to go on."

At the same time, it said, it would send its community policing unit to Ferguson and St. Louis County to analyze police methods and offer training.

The Community Relations Service has a completely different job. The 50-person, $12 million-a-year unit does not investigate crimes or train police.


Mediators here will also have to grapple with a town — Ferguson — that had no organized activist community before Brown's shooting, and instead wade through a dozen or more groups that have arisen since.

Geneva Police Chief Jeffrey E. Trickler said that mediators helped create a community agreement. "Anything we felt we needed, they were a phone call away," Trickler said. "From my eyes, things have improved."


"I want to say that we wouldn't have exploded," said Mayor Jeff Triplett of Sanford. Triplett, 45, graduated from Missouri Southern State University. "I think they got us all to the board table … probably a couple weeks faster than we ever could have done. We would have been putting out fires, so to speak, everywhere."

Adolphus Pruitt is the president of the St. Louis city branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He said he can't list all the times he has called a police department with a problem. Sometimes the police respond, but more often they don't, he said.


"That totally lit the fuse," said Christopher T. Stearns, a Navajo, attorney and former chairman of the Seattle Human Rights Commission. Justice Department mediators organized meetings and helped keep protests peaceful. At one point, said Stearns, "outside agitators, anarchists, almost hijacked some of the protests."

"They don't like to talk to the press, and don't like to talk about what they do," said Rue Landau, who is with city of Philadelphia. That secrecy, Landau said, is part of the reason why the Community Relations Service is so successful.


He added, "It's gotten a lot better since then."

The situation is far from over. Washington said she's been trying for weeks to get the angriest protesters to come to the meetings, without any success.


EDWARDSVILLE, Mo. — In many ways, the recent chaos in Ferguson is perfect fodder for high school discussions about the judicial system, civil disobedience, racial divides and the role of media.

EDWARDSVILLE, Ill. — An Illinois school district near Ferguson, Missouri has forbidden teachers from discussing the chaos in Ferguson with students.


But Abigail Wilson, an Edwardsville senior, said she'd like to talk about Ferguson and its many facets. She talks about it with friends. She'd like to discuss it in sociology.

"Nobody said the staff should be silent," said Don Senti, who is in charge of EducationPlus. Edwardsville may be the only school district in the region that has told teachers not to discuss Ferguson, he said.


On Tuesday, there was a discussion about Ferguson in student Nate Hunsell's health class. The teacher led the class in considering two perspectives — that of the residents and that of the police.

"We all have personal opinions about what has gone wrong, what has gone right. And we all have opinions on what should be done," Hightower said. "We don't need to voice those opinions ... in the classrooms."


"I thought it was kind of dumb," Nate said. "It's something that's going on. It's kind of a big deal."

"It's modern history," she said. "It's huge. It's so much more interesting than things that happened 200 years ago."


In the days leading up to the election, dozens of volunteers canvassed neighborhoods for Bell and Smith. The two were supported by a coalition of groups, including Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment, the Organization for Black Struggle, the Working Families Party and the Service Employees International Union.

Voters chose three new council members. Of those, only one was the person protesters hoped would win. Bob Hudgins and Lee Smith were supported by many who are angry about police and courts here, but both lost.


In the 1st Ward, Ella Jones, the other soon-to-be black council member, garnered nearly 50 percent of the vote in a four-way race. Jones raised more money than all of her opponents combined, thanks in part to a $7,000 donation from the Communication Workers of America.

## A Judge Wins


Jones, chair of the city's Human Rights commission, started sending out letters to raise support for her campaign long before Michael Brown was killed by Officer Darren Wilson. She said she ran partly because of the way she witnessed young black men being treated by police.

Smith lost to Bell.


"I'm worried that this is going to look bad for Ferguson because I know the world is watching, and the world is anticipating a large turnout," said LaRhonda Wilson.

"I'm hopeful we'll get the change we're looking for," she added.


"It was knocking on doors talking to people in person," Peterson said. "We talked about why Wesley was the best candidate."

Whoever tries out for the police chief's job "better be doing his homework," Bell said.

"We can't have police officers killing people!" someone in the crowd yelled.

"We cannot have looting and crimes at night," Nixon said. "We can't have people fearful."


In a parking lot near the apartment complex where Brown lived, about 60 other people gathered to listen to McCulloch's statement over car stereos, then scattered immediately after the announcement. Some drove off. Others shouted that they should go to the police department.

The crowd exploded in anger and moved toward the barrier where police in riot gear were standing. They pushed down the barrier and began throwing things at the police while the officers stood their ground.


Protesters laid a line of cinder blocks across the street near the QuikTrip convenience store that was burned down last week. It was an apparent attempt to block police vehicles, but the vehicles easily plowed through. Someone set a nearby trash bin on fire, and the crackle of gunfire could be heard from several blocks away.

Officers ordered all protesters to leave. Many of the marchers obeyed the order, but a group of about 100 stood until they got hit by a round of tear gas.


"We're starting to get back into the swing of things, people starting to come slowly but surely," says Antonio Henley, a barber and the owner of Prime Time Barber Shop, which experienced a "tremendous" loss of business when protests began. "We were down 20, 40, 50 percent when it first happened. But we survived."

"I think we're going to come out of this, and eventually we're going to come out of it even stronger, in my opinion," said Wesley Bell. He is one of two black people newly elected to the Ferguson City Council.


Near the Canfield Green apartments, a memorial plaque has replaced a pile of signs and stuffed animals that marked the spot where Brown died. But Whitt said there are some in Ferguson who would just as soon forget what happened last August.

A year ago, protesters burned down businesses. The ashes have been swept away and the streets are clear. Customers have started to shop in stores again.


"They're trying to erase this memory of this tragedy that happened right here in Canfield," Whitt said.

"Remember your stuff," she told her team. "You all know what to do."

The music started, and their smiles grew wider. Once they start dancing, nothing else matters but the McCluer basketball team and the fans.


Longtime coaches Rega Wesley-Stewart and Jackie Allen want to keep up the momentum of the competition dance team at McCluer High after strong showings in recent years, including first place in two categories at a recent competition against 40 area teams.

Because of what happened, the team has had difficulty raising money to pay for uniforms, dance camps and other expenses. The girls even have to pay for their pom-poms themselves. A fundraiser had to be canceled. The girls had trouble selling tickets. People did not want to go to the area because of the violence.


"That's a team to watch out for — that's the reputation we want," she said. "We just keep pushing."

The school district canceled classes. After-school activities and practices were also canceled. The girls had to miss practice less than two weeks before a big competition in St. Louis.


The district still pays for the coaches and transportation for the team. But other pom-pom squads in more affluent school districts have the backing of booster clubs and strong fundraising. Or they ask parents to pay for camp, uniforms or other fees.

Many of them come from families without a lot of money.


"A lot of people don't have the money," said Victoria Mantia, a junior.

Attorney General Eric Holder on Wednesday condemned a "pervasive, corrosive" lack of trust in the police department, and said that the practices of Ferguson police and courts had "severely undermined the public trust," creating a "tensely charged atmosphere, where people feel under assault, under siege."

The man refused. "The officer reportedly pointed a gun at his head, and arrested him," the report said.


The report says that "African-Americans are disproportionately represented at nearly every stage of Ferguson law enforcement, from the initial police contact to final disposition of a case in municipal court."

## Arrested Just For Walking


Several witnesses told the Los Angeles Times that the shots appeared to come from a hill beyond where protesters had gathered.

Just before the shooting, a group of officers was standing directly in front of the police station. Suddenly, shots were fired from somewhere to the northwest.


A video captured from a live stream of the events shows the protesters and the police standing idly when shots rang out. Screams and profanities could be heard before the camera operator apparently began running.

## "Standing Around Talking"


Tony Rice, a Ferguson resident and activist at the protest, said about three shots were fired.

"You couldn't even see where it was coming from," said journalist Bradley Rayford. "The bullets went right past my head." Rayford added that he did see a flash coming from somewhere up the hill.


"It was the first time I'd heard a bullet whiz and pass my head," Rice said, adding that several officers dropped their riot shields to take cover. "There's a bunch of shields on the ground," he said.

"We all ducked down" and the police took cover, Rayford said.


One officer fell to the ground and yelled out, as if he had been hit, and officers surrounded him and carried him inside, Rice said. "My assumption is he did get hit," he said.

Protester Tony Rice said about three shots were fired.


"It came from behind us," De Mian said.

Mike Kinman, a priest, had just arrived at the protest five minutes before the shots were fired.


Momma Cat, who began preparing her Thanksgiving feast Wednesday, said she wanted to find a way to join the national discussion about race and police in the wake of Brown's death. She was moved to aid in the demonstrations by what she perceives as the institutional mistreatment of black people by law enforcement in St. Louis County.

The protesters were gone. The holiday was cold and quiet — at least for a few hours.


A frequent presence at rallies, Daniels does as much marching as she can. Sitting in her living room in Florissant, a St. Louis suburb, she clutches at a balky knee, and her voice is hoarse from chanting.

"It's a day to breathe, to love one another, to share and give thanks for what we have and what we will have," said Daniels. She was surrounded by the food she stayed up all night to cook.


She was outside the Ferguson Police Department headquarters Monday and held her phone high, live-streaming the prosecutor's announcement for the crowd to hear. She left before the violence erupted.

## Giving Food And Advice


"I can't sit down. I have to be on the right side of history. But it's not my fight these days. ... This is you guys' fight, your age group, the young people," Daniels said of the younger generation. "It's our duty, it's our role, to have your back. Make sure that you guys are going about it the right way."

Momma Cat said she was trying to help the protesters. She said they are fighting against the unfair treatment of black people by police.


To do that, Daniels turned to one thing she believes can unite any group of people, regardless of what they think or where they come from.

"I can't sit down. I have to be on the right side of history," Daniels said.


Raised by Southern-born parents who both knew their way around a kitchen, Daniels says she has been cooking from a young age and received her first formal training at a vocational high school in New York City.

Daniels has been attending classes at a cooking school in St. Louis. She also cooks meals for doctors at DePaul Health Center in St. Louis.


She put her career on hold for years while she raised a family and moved around the country with her husband, Perez, a military veteran. They moved to Florissant in 2012, and Daniels has been attending classes at the Culinary Institute of St. Louis and cooking meals for doctors at DePaul Health Center in the city.

## "One Of The Mother Hens"


Logan, the pastor, said the conversations sparked over mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese Thursday would help the activists find a way to move forward after the decision.

Although she said she is not an activist, "we had to get active. We had to say, that's enough."

Another lawyer for the Brown family, Benjamin Crump, said Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch had too much control over the grand jury.

## Equal Blame For All


As Gray and Crump spoke amid snow flurries in Clayton, Baden was inside the courthouse, testifying in secret before members of the grand jury. Gray and Crump would not comment on the substance of what they believed Baden would be telling the grand jurors.

"History is clear," Gray said. Protesters were "simply exercising their First Amendment rights" in August. The protesters had rifles pointed in their face, he said. They were tear-gassed and hit by rubber bullets. Some were arrested for no reason. These actions came before the protesters acted "uncivilized," he said.


However, they said that Baden had found one new piece of evidence since his initial autopsy on Brown. A chest wound that Baden originally thought was a re-entry wound has now been determined to be an entry wound, the lawyers said.

## Everybody Wants The Same Thing: Calm


While Crump thanked McCulloch for inviting Baden to testify, he had harsh criticism for the grand jury's procedure and its secrecy.

Gray said that the parents had a request. They wanted "all of those that support justice for Mike Brown to remain" on guard, "yet peaceful, calm and dignified."


Gray began his remarks to reporters by saying that the parents wanted to encourage "all of those that support the justice for Mike Brown to remain vigilant yet peaceful, calm and dignified as we await — and after we receive the announcement of the grand jury decision."

Jon Belmar is the St. Louis County police chief.


But soon, Gray and Crump turned their attention to Nixon in response to what the governor did and did not say during his own news conference.

Belmar said he was kept up at night by the idea that people could be killed during protests. It was remarkable, he said, that no one died, or was seriously injured, during protests over Brown's death in August.

Then they waited.

Saudi Arabia, with 1.55 million Filipinos — the highest expat population after the United States — pledged $100,000, as has the Arab Gulf Program for Development.

About 680,000 Filipinos work in the United Arab Emirates. The country has donated $10 million to the relief effort.


Australia, home to 380,000 Filipino workers, has pledged $10 million in government relief, the national broadcaster ABC reported.

Saudi Arabia has 1.55 million Filipinos — the highest ex-patriot population after the United States. It is giving $100,000 to help storm victims.


In Malaysia, where 569,000 Filipinos work, established delivery services for money transfers to the Philippines are pitching in on the huge task of getting storm relief to those who need it.

Australia is home to 380,000 Filipino workers. It has pledged $10 million in relief.


Even in countries with relatively few Filipino workers, the expats have taken the lead in fund drives. In the Bahamas, for example, where just over 700 Filipinos live and work, more than 200 came together Sunday in an emergency meeting to organize a fundraiser in hopes of helping restore communications with relatives cut off by damage to electric utilities and cellphone towers, Filipino expat community leader Leo Ignacio told the Tribune 24 news channel.

In Malaysia, there are about 569,000 Filipino workers. Delivery services there let Filipinos send money back home. The companies that handle these delivery services are also pitching in. Some are helping get storm relief to those who need it.


Other states also are looking at reducing or eliminating film tax credits.

This month, Louisiana lawmakers voted to limit film tax credits to $200 million each year. The governor still has to decide if he wants to sign the law. Right now there is no limit to the amount of credits. The state is $1.6 billion short on the money it needs to run itself this year. If it cannot get the money, it may have to give less money to public universities and hospitals.


The Michigan Senate voted to spend $12 million on film tax credits after the House voted to scrap them starting Oct. 1. Republican Gov. Rick Snyder sought $50 million for the program in fiscal 2015-16, despite facing a budget deficit. The issue has yet to be resolved.

In Massachusetts, Governor Charlie Baker called for ending the state's $80 million film tax credit program. He wants to use the money for a tax credit for poor people.


"Each fish has its sweet spot," says Katherine Maslenikov, fish-collections manager at the Burke, who has dug through fish heads herself as an observer on fishing boats. Three pairs of otoliths — scientists collect only the largest pair — sit in capsules of liquid behind the fish's head. Technically, they are stones, not bones, because they contain no live cells.

## Otoliths As "Flight Recorders"


Fake eyes for fish aren't new, she pointed out.

"It's now out in the open and behaving like a normal fish," she said.


And food waste is not only vast, but growing. The 35 million tons of food discarded in 2012 is 20 percent more than the United States tossed out in 2000, 50 percent more than in 1990, and roughly three times what Americans discarded in 1960.

## Good For The Heart


"He was doing a lot of bailing in order to keep the boat up," Davis told the Los Angeles Times.

Jordan survived on just a bit of food. He fried flour pancakes on a small stove and caught fish with a hand net. He collected rainwater whenever he could.


They began to monitor a list of bodies that washed ashore in North Carolina.

On Thursday, the family got the great news they had been hoping for. Jordan's father text-messaged them that Jordan had been found alive.


"His mother just said, 'I just need a sign, I need something physical,'" Davis said.

Jordan was rescued by a giant cargo ship. "They saw me on the front of my boat, standing up there waving my arms," he said Friday.


"I haven't heard you in so long," Louis told his father. "I was afraid that you guys were crying and sad that, you know, I was dead, and I wasn't dead," he told his father.

"The last couple weeks really weighed heavy on us," Davis said. "Now we're going to have a great Easter."

In an interview on CBS last month, Christie was asked if he felt as good as he looked. "Not yet, but I hope to," he said. "I feel much, much better than I used to feel, but the fact is I still have some work to do in that area, too, and so I've just got to keep working at it."

Dr. Jaime Ponce has never treated Christie, but was shown before-and-after photos of the governor. Ponce said the photos suggest the governor is doing very well. "He's lost 100 pounds, if not a little bit more," he said.


After a diplomatic meeting went awry, Levine noted, The New York Times reported: "William Howard Taft is a very phlegmatic man, from whom one is not accustomed to hear such talk. This (damaging outburst) may be attributed to his great weight."

Christie will not let reporters watch him eat. For example, the governor recently sat down for a taco lunch while visiting Mexico. Once his food arrived, reporters were shooed away.


"They need to look like the part they are running for," Cisneros said. "If people don't see that person looks like that position — governor, president, senator from that state — then who are they?"

"I bought all this food and put it out in front of the table," Romney said. "Chris sat there and picked at a couple of pieces of lettuce."

But don't go picking fallen Fritos out of the rug just yet.

The resulting screaming match caused an unscheduled landing in Jacksonville, Florida, the third diversion in nine days caused by passenger fights over shrinking legroom.

Amy Fine got into one of those arguments. She put her head on her tray table to take a nap on a Delta flight from New York to Palm Beach, Florida.


"I can't control being this tall," he said. "Occasionally I will ask people not to recline. I will say, 'You can't go back any farther. You are on top of my knees.'"

The airline industry does not apologize. Travelers who want more room can simply pay for roomier seats, said Jean Medina. She is a spokeswoman for Airlines for America. The group represents America's largest airlines.


"I'm really concerned now," she said.

Rick Snyder is the governor of Michigan. On Jan. 5, he declared an emergency in Flint.


State efforts were ramped up this week to get free bottled water, filters, replacement cartridges and water-testing kits in the hands of Flint residents. Members of the Michigan National Guard have been deployed to Flint, and Snyder requested federal help for the water crisis.

The apology is not going to help these kids, Hawk said. She said she does not know what dangers her children may face because of the lead.


As [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) increases the likelihood of extreme droughts and floods, experts say shutting off the stations, which can each cost about $15,500 annually to maintain, could have devastating consequences.

## Slower Flood Warnings


The need for data was brought up Tuesday at the U.S. Supreme Court, where Texas and Oklahoma are sparring over water in the Red River Basin. Attorney Lisa Blatt, representing Oklahoma, said the lack of stream-flow gauges in the basin makes it nearly impossible to tell how much water each state is drawing, and whether they are sticking to a four-state agreement.

"It's a no-brainer," he said. "Like motherhood and apple pie."

But Marion reached a breaking point on Saturday, when a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, during a confrontation in a gated community.

The Englewood resident rose to become the city's second black fire chief. He is known as a calm, strong figure who stands up for his department and stays out of politics.


"I've never been an activist," the 46-year-old said. "I'm fed up. It should not be a law that you get to murder because you're uncomfortable."

The chief entered the racially charged controversy around the verdict this week. He asked the City Council to not do business with companies in Florida. He wants to boycott Florida because of its stand-your-ground laws. The laws allow people to use guns or other weapons defend themselves if they believe someone is trying to kill or seriously harm them.


Marion, a firefighter for 24 years, said stand-your-ground laws disproportionately affect blacks, especially when law enforcement and others assume black youths have criminal intent while white youths get the benefit of the doubt.

"I've never been an activist," the 46-year-old said. "I'm fed up. It should not be a law that you get to murder because you're uncomfortable."


Councilman Marc Forman called stand-your-ground laws "an abomination" but wasn't sure a boycott was the right course of action.

New Jersey's law does not allow preferences, said Bill Dressel. He is the executive director of the New Jersey association of cities. "Local governments must follow state law," he said.


"We haven't had a large crash in the population of corals. And we have seen some good signs that the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) — staghorn coral — continues to be abundant and may even be increasing in abundance in some places," said Richard Dodge, executive director of the National Coral Reef Institute at Nova Southeastern University. "So that's the good news.

## No Storms, No Ships Have Hit


"We felt like we were on a mission from God here," Davis said. "God save the queen."

## Honeybees Hit Hard


"Most people don't know hundreds of thousands of bees are moved on semis all over the place," Westervelt said.

"If mom and dad are keeping bees in the backyard, the kids are exposed and there's a chance they'll fall into the industry," Salopek said.


John Gentzel, a commercial apiarist in Homestead, started tending bees as a teenager in the 1960s after his mother found a hive in a croton bush outside their South Dade house. He learned the trade through his school's Future Farmers of America chapter and once managed more than a thousand hives tucked into fields and yards from Homestead to Fort Myers to Big Pine Key. Today his Homestead house — filled with drums and specialized equipment — serves as his production plant.

The Toyne family started keeping bees in their Coral Gables neighborhood two years ago. Ten-year-old twins Kai and Nina are already committed beekeepers, eager to talk about the benefits of bees, despite the stings.


"The government's watchdog isn't watching," United Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts said. "Safety violations that would normally be caught and corrected as a result of those inspections are being missed. Even the smallest violations, when allowed to accumulate, can lead to dangerous conditions very quickly in a coal mine."

Three mine workers died in separate accidents on three consecutive days during the past week. The coal mining industry has not had three straight days of fatal accidents in more than 10 years. The nation's largest mine workers union has raised alarms.


This early in the flu season there is little illness, meaning little to test yet. But to fill in the gap, some state health departments have been receiving and testing samples that otherwise would have gone to CDC, said Kelly Wroblewski of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.

The Food and Drug Administration has stopped normal inspections of food plants. Food imports are still being inspected at borders. But any samples that need to be analyzed could be stalled. There aren't as many scientists to check them now.


Still, many federal workers who protect safety and health are still working, from air traffic controllers to airport screeners to the majority of federal law enforcement. Active duty military personnel are on duty. USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service, the agency responsible for investigating the poultry farm in California that is linked to the salmonella outbreak, is also mostly staffed.

The CDC also is slashing its staff at airports. When airline pilots become aware of a sick traveler, they summon CDC officers. The officers can keep people who might be a health threat from coming into the country.


But then the researchers pressed the issue further, and that's when a clear division surfaced. In another experiment, they gave participants solutions containing only the three "bad" or "strange" tastes, and the participants easily divided the tastes into three groups.

## Fat Is A Flavor Star


LOS ANGELES — It's lunchtime at Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles, but 16-year-old Parrish Jackson has barely touched her turkey burger and apricots.

LOS ANGELES — It is lunchtime at Washington Preparatory High School in Los Angeles. And Parrish Jackson is dumping her school lunch in the trash can.


But under [federal school meals rules](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school lunch) finalized in 2012, Parrish and other students must take at least three items — including one fruit or vegetable — even if they don't want them. Otherwise, the federal government won't reimburse school districts for the meals.

## Food Fight Between Experts


That prompted the banning of all GMO cultivation in several dozen nations, including Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Greece, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Russia and Denmark.

Eighty percent of supermarket foods now contain GMOs. They also contain the toxic chemicals sprayed on GMOs.


### CON: GMO labels won't make foods safer, only more expensive

Americans can help stop this law from passing. Tell Congress you want labels on GMOs.


By the year 2025, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) estimates that two-thirds of the world's population will confront a water shortage and ecosystems will also suffer.

### CON: GMO foods are safe, no need for labels


In some cases, this will make the difference between a harvest or crop failure. Some results show crop yields increasing by 4 to 8 percent in arid conditions with others suggesting gains as much as 21 percent.

But labeling these foods is certainly not about food safety. No humans have been harmed by GMO products — ever. And it's also not something that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  can legally do right now. There is no scientific difference between GMO foods and regular foods.


Organic foods are four to eight times more likely to be recalled for microbial contamination. And for that, you are paying a lot more.

These crops produce foods that keep better. They spoil less from mold, don't cause allergies, and can even grow medicines in them.


Among patients from low-income neighborhoods, hospitalizations were 27 percent higher in the last week of the month compared with the first, when most states send out government checks and food stamps, said lead researcher Dr. Hilary Seligman of the University of California, San Francisco. But hospitalizations didn't increase among diabetics from higher-income areas, she reported Tuesday in the journal Health Affairs.

"If you're interested in saving health care costs, the dumbest thing you can do is cut nutrition," said Dr. Deborah Frank. She's a children's doctor at the Boston Medical Center.


The bill will also likely add some money for food banks and test new work requirements for recipients in a few states, a priority for many Republicans.

## Lacking Good Food


That means, the study noted, Americans squander $165 billion every year on food destined for landfills where the decomposition of organic matter emits 16 percent of the country's methane - a greenhouse gas that's 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

"When I got here, he was a guy who had everybody laughing and told jokes," said McKinnie, a tackle who joined the team two weeks ago. "I didn't really see the side being portrayed right now."

"The only thing affecting us is we can't even get dressed," said receiver Mike Wallace, looking at all the reporters.


An Ohio chiropractor sells a somewhat similar product called Shockstrip — pads meant to be glued to the shell of the helmet. His company's website claims it reduces the impact of collisions, though he declined to respond to questions from the Tribune.

"I've been coaching football for 45 years, and I'm always looking for a way to make the game safer," he said. "We're hoping this is a good technology. It seems to make some sense."


Theory, though, isn't good enough for NOCSAE, which in early August said that manufacturers can void their helmets' safety certification if an aftermarket product is attached. Some, including Riddell and Schutt, a sporting goods manufacturer based in downstate Litchfield, have said they will do just that.

"I can just go by results," he said. "In 21 practices, we've had one concussion. I would think that's on the lower side for teams in our area."

"It was the largest normal kidney I've ever seen in my life," said Dr. Stephen Bartlett, the hospital's surgeon-in-chief who performed Chris' procedure. "I felt like somebody had thrown me a small football."

"Chris and Ma'ake aren't your average-sized people," said Dr. David Leeser, chief of kidney and pancreas transplantation. He said that Ma'ake would medically have been considered too heavy to be healthy. A lot of hospitals would not have let Ma'ake give up his kidney, Leeser said. "He has a 22-inch neck, which is the waist size for a lot of women. But when we measured his body fat it came out average for men in the U.S."


The five-hour surgery went off without a hitch.

In a 2-1/2-hour operation, Leeser removed one of Ma'ake's kidneys. The organ measured 13 centimeters, about 3 cm. more than average.


Stanford coach David Shaw said he has been rejecting technology like this for 20 years because every previous incarnation was "terrible, terrible." They were mostly video-game caliber representations rather than a 3-D reality.

## A Great Idea For A Company


But when Bailenson and a pair of his ex-players, Edwards and kicker Derek Belch, brought him this breakthrough, Shaw not only embraced it for Stanford practices, he fronted the money to help found the company. No one actually throws a pass while wearing the headset, but for Shaw it was way to bring his playbook to life.

Stanford football coach David Shaw said he has been turning down technology like this for 20 years. Older versions were "terrible, terrible," he said. They all looked like video games.


Bailenson told him it was a brilliant idea, but warned him how often previous attempts had flopped. "So Derek goes away and starts collecting master's degrees," the professor said.

"His decision-making was faster. Everything was quicker," coach Shaw said.


Bruno has made the new-country shift twice. Originally from Sao Paulo, he and his family moved to Sweden when he was 7, returned home for several years, then moved to the west suburbs this summer.

Noushin Ajmeri, 14, came to the United States from India two years ago. She said the move was hard for her. Girls in America behave very differently from girls in India. In India, girls do not talk to boys or speak up much. Girls in America wear shorts in the summer. They also talk to boys and even hug them.


Ema Smith shared a similar message of persistence with the younger teens.

Bruno Borges, who is 15 years old, moved from Brazil this summer. He told the younger children that everyone has challenges in life.


The 18-year-old said she felt loads of frustration when her family moved from Zacapa, Guatemala, to Glendale Heights, Illinois, in April 2013. Slowly things got easier as she began celebrating small victories for herself, such as when she felt confident enough to ask her teacher for a bathroom break or when she made a new friend in class.

When Bruno was 7, his family moved to Sweden. They later returned to Brazil for several years and then came to the United States. "Here, at least I knew a little English," Bruno said. "You need to be confident and you need to expect the best of yourself."


For the first few years at Garfield High School she floundered. "School never really was a super-important aspect of my life. My parents never took interest in my schooling," said Robinson. "Junior year, it was hard to focus and pay attention at school."

Robinson didn't live with her parents during high school. She lived with her aunt, in foster care. Almost half of the kids in foster care do not graduate.


But with the help of Treehouse, a nonprofit organization founded in 1988 by social workers dedicated to helping foster kids, she got her diploma and is looking to the future.

School was never a big part of her life. "My parents never took interest in my schooling," Robinson said.


"We started to take the longer look, of, 'What do you think you are gonna need to be an owner of a business?'" said Schloss. "She was able to start connecting her high school graduation to her goals; she really was able to start to see how some of those classes she didn't like, like math and science, were necessary for her to get what she wanted. And when she started making those connections, I think it started to really click for her that she was getting in her own way by not doing well in those classes."

Robinson said she was mostly worried about her parents, not school or her own life.


McKernan's body went numb. Grim thoughts flooded his head: No exam this year. No college, ever.

## From Hopeless To Hopeful


Edina was hardly the first city to go younger when it decided two years ago to begin playing fourth-grade travel basketball. "We were one of just a handful" that had not yet lowered the age, said Paul Manley, Edina's boys' travel director. "We were trying to catch up. (We thought), 'We need to do that otherwise we're going to be behind the 8-ball.'"

Ten years ago, the Minnesota Youth Athletic Services (MYAS) began hosting a state tournament for boys' fourth-grade traveling teams. When it started, 20 teams played. Last year, 115 teams played.


Deborah Edwards, the executive director of the Positive Coaching Alliance in Minnesota, said she can only shake her head over what is happening. "Youth sports is so scheduled — it's over-scheduled. I think these traveling basketball teams just add to the over-scheduling of the kids."

It is not the kids, like Lleyton, who are asking to play competitive basketball, but the parents, said Rich Penick, the director at MYAS. "It's the parents that are driving it."


The men showed "that faced with terror, we have the power to resist. You also gave a lesson in courage, in will, and thus in hope," Hollande said.

"On Friday you were simply passengers," Hollande said on Monday. "You behaved as soldiers but also as responsible men."


The gunman, identified as 26-year-old Moroccan Ayoub El-Khazzani, is detained and being questioned by French counterterrorism police outside Paris.

## "World Admires Your Courage"


Hollande said another passenger, French-American citizen Mark Moogalian, also intervened. Moogalian is hospitalized with a gunshot wound from the incident — and his wife told Europe-1 radio Monday that he, too, "is among the heroes in this story."

Sophie David is El-Khazzani's lawyer. She said the gunman told her he only wanted to rob the train and not to kill anyone. El-Khazzani claims he found his gun by chance. He said it was lying in a garden near the train station.


Parents like Eric and Isabelle Nizard are angry over a sinister social experiment being conducted on their 9-year-old son, Sacha. It's the latest innovation in French public education: Their child must now attend school on Wednesdays.

Beginning in September, Wednesday was no longer an official day off in France. It was a traditional break in the middle of the week for elementary school students. But now, French children have to show up for class Monday through Friday.


Isabelle Nizard helped put together a petition from her affluent neighborhood in the 16th arrondissement demanding that the mayor of Paris scrap the schedule revamp. It hasn't succeeded.

## A Call For A National Strike


Instead, the parents group she leads and others across France are now urging members to pull their kids out of school next Wednesday in protest. Unions representing teachers and other campus staff have called for a national strike the following day.

Isabelle helped put together a letter from people in her rich neighborhood demanding that the mayor of Paris stop the new school week. It hasn't succeeded.


PARIS — The French government launched a new effort Thursday to heal social and religious fractures by better teaching children about secular values and steering them away from extremist propaganda, after French-born Islamic radicals shocked the nation in three days of terror attacks.

PARIS — Gunmen belonging to a terror group shocked France with three days of  attacks in January. In response, the government began a new effort to heal the country. It hopes to steer children away from extremist messages online. It thinks teaching them values shared by all French people will help.


Specific funds to help the poorest families with some schooling costs will increase by 20 percent, to 45 million euros ($52 million), she said.

Sacko, a Muslim born in France, said the prime minister's plans to fix poverty are a "dream." ''Nothing will change, I promise you," he said.


"How can we accept that our educational system can't promote all talents, that so many middle schoolers do not master basics, do not master foreign languages?" Prime Minister Manuel Valls wrote Monday, May 19 in the Liberation newspaper. "In the current world — a globalized world, a world of exchanges — this is sending our children, and therefore our country, toward an impasse."

Peter Gumbel is a British reporter who lives in Paris. He is about to publish a second book about French schools. He said the plan is a weak way to deal with an urgent problem.


His successor, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, has staked her tenure on the latest changes, describing critics as "pseudo-intellectuals" full of lies and nonsense.

"How can we accept that our educational system can't promote all talents, that so many middle schoolers do not master basics, do not master foreign languages?" Prime Minister Manuel Valls wrote in a French newspaper.


## City In Search Of A Makeover

Even the poorest New Haven students have a chance to go to college. Yale University is paying for the program.


Under the community eligibility provision, the federal government pays for only a share of the expansion, leaving states to pay the balance. As a result, not all school districts are expected to participate.

"Everyone's got a great meal that they can get at no charge," said Madeleine Levin of the Food Research and Action Center. It just becomes normal and unites the schools, she said.

"One meal could be their energy budget for an entire year," Nishikawa said. She should know: She has a horned frog at home that hasn't eaten since November when it went into hibernation for the winter.

## Super Strength Stickiness


"The common opinion is that the mucus is some sort of superglue that sticks to everything immediately," Kleinteich said. But the results of his experiment showed exactly the opposite: Stronger adhesion occurred with less mucus.

One meal could be all they need to eat for the whole year, Nishikawa said. She should know. She has a horned frog at home that hasn't eaten since November, when it went into hibernation for the winter.

Months ago, many warned him not to invest in a place where fair-weather tourists flee in the fall and the big lake's waters turn cold and storm-tossed, forcing the 100 or so hardy full-time residents of Cornucopia to hibernate for the winter. He'd be out of business by March, they said.

"What's driven the growth of futsal courts is you can provide a playable space at a smaller cost and in a smaller area," said Patrick Escobar, a vice president of the LA84 Foundation, which disburses surplus money from the 1984 Olympics and has funded some of the construction.

Huge shredders turn circuit boards and hard drives into large bits of glass, metal and plastics. Those pieces then have to be melted to separate valuable metals, said Ted Smith. He started the Electronics TakeBack Coalition. It is located in San Francisco.


Industrial-scale shredders turn circuit boards and hard drives into voluminous bits of glass, metal and plastics, which require further processing in a smelter to isolate the gold, silver, copper and palladium, said Ted Smith, founder of the San Francisco-based Electronics TakeBack Coalition.

"There are no smelters that do this in the U.S.," due to the environmental effects of smelting, Smith said. The shredding companies send the metal to a smelter in Canada.


"When I first started taking this to trade shows for summer camps, maybe 15 percent knew what gaga was," Silverman said. "I had to get people in the pit and teach them. Now I go to these same shows, and only 15 percent don't know what it is."

The number of players does not matter. Everybody starts with one hand touching a wall. Then, a soft ball is dropped in the center. Players slap the ball and try to hit the other players below the knee to get them out. The last player left in the pit wins.


Players start with one hand touching a wall. A lightweight ball — like those used for kickball — is dropped in the center. Then someone slaps the ball underhand, attempting to hit the other players on or below the knee to eliminate them from the pit.

Cortesi applied for a PTA grant to get Madison a pit after witnessing the popularity of the game at neighboring Bower Elementary in Warrenville, Illinois. Parents and students helped him construct the first pit from wood and Silverman's steel brackets during spring break.

Illinois dad Dan Israelite says his sons can play for hours. "It's amazing how popular it is and how it stays this way."

Scientists have looked for the Lyman-alpha line in other distant galaxies and come up empty, which might mean that their light was still being blocked by a haze of neutral hydrogen that hadn't been ionized yet.

It is a dependable line on which to base redshift, and distance, estimates, Illingworth said. It helped them decide how far away the galaxy was. With that settled, the team could estimate the star mass, star formation rate and formation period of this galaxy.

Be careful what you bet on. Experts have expressed concern over Internet gambling for years.

WASHINGTON — Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos are now licensed to operate online gambling sites. It's good news for them. Casinos in those cities have had been making less and less money for seven years. The University of Nevada studied what would happen if casino profits continue to shrink. It found that if this continues, casinos will have to double their online gambling websites to make up for the money their casino houses are losing.


However, the FBI countered this claim in a 2009 letter to the Financial Services Committee stating, "While the (online gambling) vendors may claim that they can validate age and location, they are more than likely relying on credit card information and geo-location to gather this information. Both can be spoofed."

The NGISC said it found plenty of proof that problem gambling increases anxiety in marriages and families. Its survey of Americans found that gambling problems were a strong cause of divorce.


"That's not uncommon," he said. "But then there was a tibia, and then a fibula, and at that point we were getting excited."

## Very Well Preserved


Molly knew how to get home. A fence built in the early 1900s to protect farmland from rabbits ran the length of the continent; it was by some accounts the longest unbroken fence in the world. Jigalong was located along this "rabbit-proof" fence. The girls had to head east to find it, then follow it north to reach their native land.

In 1931, the government took Pilkington Garimara's mother, Molly, her mother's sister, Daisy, and a cousin from their home. The girls were sent to the Moore River Settlement 1,000 miles away.


In 1941, while Molly was hospitalized with appendicitis, Neville ordered agents to grab her daughters and sent them to the Moore River Settlement. When she recovered, she joined 4-year-old Doris and 18-month-old Anna there. After a year, however, she ran back to Jigalong, taking the baby with her. She had no time to say goodbye to Doris, whom she left in the care of Daisy, the sister who had escaped Moore River with Molly a decade earlier and, like Molly, had been forced to return.

Molly married and had two children. She named her older girl Nugi Garimara, who was born in 1937, and later renamed her Doris. But because the government did not record aboriginal births, her exact birth date is unknown.


Doris worked for many years as a community health nurse in Geraldton, about 260 miles north of Perth. She married a man with the last name Pilkington and raised six children; later she studied journalism.

## Doris Taken Away


Still, the race offers an idea of what might be possible on roadways of the future, with sleek, efficient vehicles powered by a variety of fuels. As in the competition, the cars of tomorrow are likely to come in several flavors, depending on where you live in the country and which energy sources are most readily available.

And don't get the idea that these curiosities will be showing up on an expressway near you. The Swarthmore car weighs just 137 pounds and is only 8 1/2 feet long.


The Eco-marathon field is divided into two main categories. "Urban concept" vehicles are required to look somewhat like contemporary passenger cars, with four wheels and a roof over the driver's head. Creators of prototype vehicles, such as Swarthmore's, have freer rein.

"It's a demonstration," said engineering professor Nelson Macken, who has been guiding the project. It is "totally unrealistic."


The computer science major weighs just 95 pounds and stands 4 feet, 10 1/2 inches, allowing her to fit into the small car with room to spare. The rules require the driver to weigh at least 110 pounds, so Macfarland will have to add some ballast to the vehicle to compensate.

## Trouble With Gremlins


Much better than having the 6-foot-1 Macfarland drive. Since his long limbs do not fit inside the cockpit, he had to remove the car's body panels to take it for a brief spin on campus.

Don't forget the secret weapon: Winnie Ngo, a junior from Oakland, Calif., who will be behind the wheel.


"People were turning and staring," Ngo said.

The computer science student weighs just 95 pounds and stands 4 feet, 10 1/2 inches. Her tiny size allows her to fit into the small car with room to spare.


"Right now, we're chasing electric gremlins around the car," Macfarland said.

Fuel cell cars are non-polluting: They don't give off any smoke or gasses.


Rolf Olson, project leader at Loxahatchee, defended the hunt as the pursuit of a traditional activity at wildlife refuges that goes back to President Theodore Roosevelt, a hunter himself who established the nation's first national wildlife refuge in 1903. And hunting is not new to Loxahatchee, he said, which has long allowed duck hunting.

## "Bloody, Unnecessary"


He said the First Amendment area will not be hidden away and that any hunters arriving will see the protesters.

## Plenty Of Alligators


The protest is planned at the refuge's south entrance on Loxahatchee Road, six miles west of 441, not the visitor's entrance on 441.

Rolf Olson, project leader at Loxahatchee, defended the hunt. He pointed out that hunting has been traditional at wildlife refuges since the time of President Theodore Roosevelt. The president established the nation's first national wildlife refuge in 1903. He was also a hunter himself.


The Abbott lawyer said he had "no idea" whether the man was gay but declined to provide another reason for the strike after the trial judge accepted it.

"This is really a very big deal," said Jon W. Davidson. He is an official with a gay rights advocacy group. "It is likely to have a significant (effect) on other cases."


Lawyers can often get around the antidiscrimination requirement by providing a neutral reason for a juror's removal, but "if the real reason is bias, they have to be quick on their feet to come up with another reason, and it has to be consistent with how they treated other jurors," Davidson said.

The judges said people don't have to tell anyone if they're gay. But if they do, they can't be kept off a jury because of it.


"We have never before upheld the standing of a private party to defend the constitutionality of a state statute when state officials have chosen not to. We decline to do so for the first time here," Roberts wrote.

The people who sued "get to go back to California and, together with every other citizen of California, marry the person they love," he said.


Kris Perry, one of the plaintiffs in the California case, cheered the decision from the Supreme Court steps. She and her partner would be able to tell their four sons "you're just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love."

## The Battle Isn't Over


Stier said the battle is not over.

She said they would be able to tell their four sons "you're just as good as everybody else, no matter who you love, no matter who your parents love."


WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for an immediate expansion of same-sex marriage by unexpectedly and tersely turning away appeals from five states seeking to prohibit gay and lesbian unions. The court's order effectively makes gay marriage legal now in 30 states.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way Monday for gay people to get married in 11 states.


Ed Whelan of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an opponent of same-sex marriage, also chastised the court for its "irresponsible denial of review in the cases." Whelan said it is hard to see how the court could eventually rule in favor of same-sex marriage bans after having allowed so many court decisions striking down those bans to remain in effect.

Same-sex marriage is still not legal in every state across the country. Same-sex marriage is when a man marries a man or a woman marries a woman. Still, the court's decision means that same-sex marriage is now legal in 30 states, and also the District of Columbia.


— In North Carolina, lawyers for same-sex couples said they planned to ask a judge Monday to overturn the state's gay marriage ban.

Ed Whelan is with the Ethics and Public Policy Center. The group is against same-sex marriage. He criticized the Supreme Court and said it was not acting responsibly. Whelan also thinks that Supreme Court should have heard the same-sex marriage appeals.  Whelan said that so many states allow same-sex marriage that the court will a hard time stopping it.


The justices have an obligation to settle an issue of such national importance, not abdicate that responsibility to lower court judges, the advocates said. Opting out of hearing the cases leaves those lower court rulings in place.

— In Virginia, same-sex couples could get marriage licenses as early as Monday afternoon.


James Esseks of the American Civil Liberties Union said he believes the court will quickly take up a case if an appeals court upholds state bans.

— In Oklahoma, same-sex couples will receive permission to marry soon. The county clerk is waiting until he receives an order from a federal judge.


By midafternoon, the truce appeared to be holding. In Gaza City, families on foot, in rusty automobiles and in donkey-drawn carts began the trek from temporary shelters back to bombarded neighborhoods in the northern and eastern part of the territory.

## Israeli Troops Pull Out


Indirect talks to be held in the Egyptian capital looked to be contentious. Hamas has previously demanded a lifting of the Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza, the territory Hamas has controlled since 2007, but Israel is reluctant to reward the Islamist movement for what it considers blatant aggression in the run-up to the war. And Egypt, which controls access to southern Gaza through a crossing at Rafah, has a government hostile to Hamas.

By midafternoon, the truce appeared to be holding. In Gaza City, families on foot, in rusty automobiles and in donkey-drawn carts began leaving shelters. They started the trek back to bombarded neighborhoods.


"One of the results, one would hope, of a cease-fire would be some form of demilitarization so that this doesn't continue, doesn't repeat itself," Blinken said in an interview with NPR. "That needs to be the end result."

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration banned flights into Israel Tuesday. A day earlier, a Hamas rocket landed near the main airport. Even so, Secretary of State Kerry flew into Tel Aviv Wednesday, showing his determination to end the fighting.


On Tuesday, U.S. and European airlines canceled flights to Israel after a Hamas rocket hit near the Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv. Israeli officials have slammed the cancellations as an overreaction that rewards Hamas, and Israel's own El Al airline is still flying in and out of Ben Gurion.

She noted an Israeli bombing that killed three children and wounded two others while they were playing on the roof of their home.


This month, the University of Chicago-educated molecular biophysicist will end a two-year fellowship in the NASA Ames Synthetic Biology program to become a full-time disciple of the "do-it-yourself" biology movement, convinced that citizen scientists, even on a shoestring budget, can help solve big societal problems. 

Jacob Corn is a scientist in California. He supports Zayner's idea. Corn says that it could never be used to change human genes. He thinks it is a good way to teach people how to work with genes.


"Everything our body does functions off of genes," Truelson explained. "When you think about diseases, many of them have an underlying genetic or inherited basis to them."

Dr. Alexander Parker said one woman had a disease that was not getting better with the regular medicine. Using genetic tests, the doctors found a medicine that worked.


"I think of it as nature set the table, and Genghis Khan came to eat," said Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University, in a video describing the research. "He didn't have to come eat, and he didn't have to eat the way he did, but the table was set and it was a matter of whether or not the culture and the people capitalized on that."

## Khan's Army Of Horsemen


"We are preserving this painting forever, for posterity, and at this point in its history, it needs some attention," said chief curator Brandon Brame Fortune. "It's still very, very stable. But we want to be sure our visitors are seeing it looking its absolute best."

## George Will Clean Up Nicely


The original Lansdowne painting remained in Britain for most of its history until the 1960s when it was loaned to the Smithsonian. The Portrait Gallery then bought the painting in 2001 for $20 million with a donation from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation.

The revolution succeeded in 1783 and the colonies became the United States of America. George Washington became the first American president in 1789.


The legislation would allow licensed gun owners to take weapons into houses of worship if the church allows it, into bars unless the owner objects, into airports up to screening areas, and into government buildings, except past security checkpoints.

## Guns For School Staff Members


It would permit schools to arm staff members and lower the age from 21 to 18 for active members of the military to obtain gun licenses. It would forbid the confiscation of firearms during an emergency, a response to authorities taking guns in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The measure also would offer defendants an "absolute defense" in court if a gun is used in the face of a violent attack.

Recently, a number of states have loosened up on gun control laws. The states are responding to well-publicized shootings. But instead of making guns less available, their solution is to make guns more available.


And the bill was supported by his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Jason Carter, former President Jimmy Carter's grandson.

"You're not going to stop crime by (taking guns away from) good people," said Jerry Henry. He is with GeorgiaCarry.org, a group that supports the bill. Pro-gun groups say that "good" people need to carry guns to stop "bad" people from committing crimes.


But Mike Griffin, public affairs representative of the Georgia Baptist Convention, said in support of the legislation that it was a matter of letting churches set the rules for themselves.

Leaders of Georgia's churches don't agree about the bill.


"Georgia Baptists are not saying that they're for or against weapons being in churches," he said. "What they're saying is churches should have the right to determine if they choose to have weapons."

Francis J. Mulcahy is with the Georgia Catholic Conference. He is concerned that more people would get shot. Don Plummer, a spokesman for the Episcopal Diocese of Atlanta, said that allowing guns in churches is "dangerous."


Gun rights groups point out that a number of the provisions of the Georgia legislation are already in effect in other states.

## Less Support For Gun Control


Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said the bill would make Georgia the 27th state to allow licensed gun owners to bring weapons into bars.

Georgia's Episcopal bishops say it's hard to make sure that only "good" guys get guns, because it's not always possible to know who the good guys are, they said.


Adam Winkler, a University of California, Los Angeles law professor who has written extensively about the politics surrounding guns, said the Georgia legislation "shows how strong the NRA is in some parts of the country. They've defeated so many gun laws that ending bans on guns in bars and churches is all that's left."

Mike Griffin is with the Georgia Baptist Convention. He supports the legislation. He said that churches should set the rules for themselves.


"The risk far outweighed the benefit," Scott said.

School officials were quick to express their support for people who legally carry guns. They said they were simply uncomfortable at the idea of weapons inside school buildings. They weren't convinced by recent gun violence at schools, either.


Dorn said far more often schools face smaller threats than a lone shooter intent on killing many— a student with disabilities who gets hold of a screwdriver or a desperate parent caught in a custody battle.

Representative Alan Powell said lawmakers intentionally left the decision to school boards. He argued that weapon-free zones are targets.


"Everyone's so focused on the last event, picturing a 30- or 40-year-old brandishing an AK-47," Dorn said.

"You can't control what bad people do," Powell said. "You can only guarantee people their constitutional right to protect themselves."


After 2011, state agencies and city officials amassed new salt piles, deployed new equipment, and implemented new agreements to use private resources to clear the roads. But this time, the problem wasn't too few resources: It was too many people.

The problem was that storm wasn't this storm.


"That's a fact. That's an absolute fact," Stellman said.

Nothing in the 2011 storm plan told officials when to warn the public or tell them to stay where they are.


Mike Smith, an AccuWeather senior vice president and board certified consulting meteorologist, also disputed any suggestion that meteorologists bore responsibility for the chaos that reigned across the region Tuesday.

Steven Picou is a professor at the University of South Alabama who researches how people respond to disasters. He said Atlanta's snow disaster was caused by bad decisions.


As part of the 2011 lessons learned, the director of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency was given a new role coordinating agencies' disaster preparations.

Instead, the officials blamed the National Weather Service (NWS). They all claimed the weather service didn't give them clear information.


At Wednesday's news conference, GEMA Director Charley English stressed how well the state followed the 2011 plan. "We did everything we said we were going to do: got extra plows, did the pre-treating," he said.

## NWS Says Issued Winter Storm Warning


As the disaster unfolded, GEMA's website displayed no instructions to drivers, and a prominent link to "winter weather" led to a week-old tip sheet on insulating homes and cars following the early January "polar vortex." State Department of Transportation Commissioner Keith Golden said that before the storm, he and English never had a conversation about whether to forcefully urge people to stay home Tuesday.

Keith Stellman is the meteorologist in charge at the NWS office for the Atlanta area. As the storm approached, the weather service changed its prediction of the amount of snow that would fall, he said. But its predictions on when and where the snow would hit never changed.


Deal said that in hindsight he would have done that sooner. He said the state had learned lessons for next time, such as working with schools and the public to urge them to stagger drive times. But he still said the timing of the storm warning from the National Weather Service was a problem.

"That's a fact. That's an absolute fact," Stellman said.


"Yes, I would have acted sooner and I think we learned from that and we will act sooner next time," Deal said. "But we don't want to be accused of crying wolf. Because if we'd been wrong, y'all would have been in here saying, 'Do you know how many millions of dollars you've cost the economy and the city of Atlanta?'"

Mike Smith is an AccuWeather senior vice president and meteorologist. He also denied that meteorologists were responsible for the chaos.


"It was very clear that perhaps the biggest contributor to just how long commutes were taking was the sheer number of cars on the road at the same time," she said.

As the snowstorm got worse, GEMA's website gave no instructions to drivers. A link on its site to "winter weather" led to a week-old tip sheet on keeping homes and cars warm. Georgia Department of Transportation head Keith Golden said he and English never spoke about telling people to stay home.


State Superintendent John Barge, a Republican who is challenging Deal for the governorship, was ready to criticize his rival.

Fulton County Transportation Director David Ricks said that sometimes you just have to be more careful. "For all of us, that's a lesson learned." Kay Love, administrator of Roswell, was even more blunt. "This was man-made," she said.


In contrast, seniors Meghan Gingrich and Peyton Kaercher chose to translate the old German dialect directly into English.

Students Colin Creedon and Daniel Jackson chose to translate the old German alphabet, known as Fraktur, into modern German first. Then they translated the modern German text they were more familiar with into English.


"Once you know what the words say, it's really easy," Kaercher said.

"We have to translate it and then rearrange it so it makes sense in English," Creedon explained.


Gaa said the German students are providing "a service to people" who can't read German and don't live locally and can't access the old newspapers on microfilm at the Belleville Public Library.

Eberhard said the obituary allowed him to "connect some of the dots" of his family's history.


"The letters that they used are not what they would look like now," said senior Thomas Carter. "The letters they used back then are obscure."

Gaa said the German students are providing "a service to people" who can't read German.


"The challenge is translating it and making it sound like good English," Gaa said. "There's definitely an art to it."

Student Madelyne Knipp said it's "really cool" to translate the old German notices into English. "I like translating this stuff knowing it's going to help people."


Gingrich said it's "really neat" to be involved in a project that could potentially help someone find out more about their ancestors.

## Mistakes Are Not An Option


Senior Adam Lanter said, "I think it's really cool we are able to help people find their heritage."

"I'm interested in Belleville history, so it's worthwhile for me," Gaa said.


Once the obituaries are translated into English by the students, they type them up and submit them to Gaa for review.

## All About Those German Towns


Robert Edsel, author of the book "The Monuments Men," which chronicles the search for and recovery of art looted during World War II, said the discovery validated the view that what had been discovered so far was the tip of the iceberg.

It is the largest collection of stolen art held by a single person, says Julian Radcliffe. He works at the Art Loss Register in London. It tracks works of art that have vanished. "Two years ago we found a dealer who had two stolen pictures in his safe when he died, and we thought that was pretty shocking. To find one on this scale is exceptional."


"What would have happened if the family had not identified it?" Webber asked.

One member of the police told the magazine that Gurlitt was a man "who didn't exist." His name could not be found on any government lists. It is believed that he didn't pay taxes.


To survive the Nazis, van Perlstein needed documents showing that he was half Aryan, and he asked Gerhardt for help. Gerhardt was a photographer and knew he could help with part of the project, but he'd need another friend to produce the documents themselves. He turned to another another German soldier, Klemke, who also loved books and hated Nazis, and was an artist.

Van Perlstein needed certain documents to escape the Nazis. He needed to show that he was only part Jewish. He asked Gerhardt for help. Gerhardt was a photographer. He knew he could help, but he'd need another friend to produce the documents. He turned to another another German soldier, Klemke, an artist who also loved books and hated Nazis.


In all, the network saved an estimated 500 Jews. Others, including members of the underground and British pilots, also were saved. The hiding places built into walls and attics and cellars in the village were not discovered, and today are used as storage rooms, she noted. The search for a network of underground tunnels continues.

Klemke never talked about that part of his life.


Harald Kretzschmar, a cartoonist and protege who knew Klemke, said that aspect of the story might not make sense in an age when people quickly log on to social media to boast about minor accomplishments.

Betsalel noted that when someone once asked Klemke about the rescue effort, he responded: "What was so special about it? I only did what any man should have done." She said Klemke and van Perlstein had reminded each other that they had saved so few, and so many were not saved.


Now, Troeglitz has become a symbol of another stark European reality: As thousands of would-be refugees, fleeing wars and privation in the Middle East and Africa, are boarding boats in desperate efforts to reach Europe, Europeans aren't embracing their arrival even as hundreds perish in the effort to get here.

## Anti-Refugee Marches And A Fire


Then on April 4, the building being renovated to house the refugees, which had been the focus of the protests, was destroyed by fire. Police quickly determined that the fire was arson and blamed supporters of the NPD. The NPD slogan for the town was simple: "No Asylum in Troeglitz."

In March, the mayor of Troeglitz, Markus Nierth, quit. He said he'd been receiving threats that made continuing in his job impossible.


"Imagine, this is a time of war and you're asking Lincoln again to do this thing," Hamill said.

The Patriot-Union said that with the anniversary of the speech, "the time was ripe" to clear the air.

Goldman and UW-Madison horticulture professor James Nienhuis have grown giant pumpkins for several years — though theirs top out at only 400 pounds, which they use for a giant pumpkin regatta for their students on Lake Mendota.

Chris Stevens of New Richmond, Wisconsin, is an expert pumpkin grower. He broke the world record in 2010 with a 1,810-pound pumpkin.


According to Ancient History Et Cetera, a news site on matters of archaeology and history, the Sulaymaniyah Museum, in the predominantly Kurdish city of the same name, acquired a cache of ancient tablets from a smuggler in 2011. The museum offered a "no questions asked" policy to smugglers in the hopes of preventing Iraq's cultural patrimony from leaving its borders.

The Islamic State has bulldozed and exploded temples and palaces in Iraq and Syria.


The association has various centers, including the Population Management Center at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago and the Wildlife Contraception Center at the St. Louis Zoo, to monitor animal populations.

## Was Killing It The Only Way?


In a statement released Monday, the association's executive director Kris Vehrs said: "Through the AZA Species Survival Plan program, these methods include science-based breeding recommendations and cooperating to plan for adequate space. AZA's Wildlife Contraception Center and AZA's Population Management Center help AZA members with the expertise and planning to manage animal populations.

"In Copenhagen Zoo we let the animals breed naturally," said Bengt Holst in the statement. He is the zoo's scientific director. He explained that the zoo's animals breed at the same times they would in the wild. The use of medication or an operation to prevent breeding can cause painful problems, so the zoo believes it is better for the animal to be killed.


The Jyllands Park Zoo in Denmark is not EAZA-accredited, and association officials stated they do not support the decision to euthanize the second Marius.

## "Very Careful Planning"


"It is certainly the philosophy of North American accredited zoos that … for any offspring, we guarantee a sustainable home for its natural life," said Dewar.

Simmons said the San Diego Zoo places animals in select groups to prevent breeding. These groups are found in nature, but would not have babies. Examples include single-gender groups and groups with animals past reproductive age.


The Danish company debuted its Friends line in 2012 with girls top of mind: The sets have a bright color palette with lots of purple, and come with more human-like figures.

Bettina Chen and Alice Brooks started a company that makes toys. They named it Roominate. Their first toy was a car. It did not work out well because it was just too educational, and not much fun, Chen said.


The growing popularity of construction toys for girls also reflects a shift in family dynamics. Parents are increasingly more open to toys that cross traditional gender stereotypes, and dads are taking a bigger share of child-care duties.

People in the toy business told her it would not work. They said girls' toys need to be "sparkly with ponies," Sterling said.


LOS ANGELES — The Girl Scout stands shyly on the grassy edge of what, at this moment, is quite possibly the happiest concrete slab in Los Angeles, California.

LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Claire Dundee stands shyly on the edge of a basketball court.


All of which makes the Girl Scout look lost. A stray ball rolls to her feet. She bends down and gently tosses it back to the crowd of kids and now they're staring like, what is she doing here?

"I know, I know," she said with a smile. She is 16 years old. "People say, 'You're still a Girl Scout? Isn't that for second-graders?'"


"It's a huge need for us to have a space for children to have a safe place to play," said Tim Peters, executive director of Door of Hope. "For kids going through trauma, to be able to do kid things, that's such a big thing."

"It's amazing that a kid can have an idea and end up serving other kids in the community," said Nicole Peters. She is with Door of Hope.


"We were quite apprehensive whether this Girl Scout could tackle that big of a project," he said.

"I can see a smile on his face, a change in him, he can come downstairs and just play and be a kid," she said. "Who knew a court could be so important?"

The Digital Cookie upgrade, announced Tuesday, comes amid persisting challenges for the 103-year-old organization. According to figures provided to The Associated Press, youth membership for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 was 1.88 million, down nearly 6.2 percent from 2014, and adult membership was 784,120, down 3.1 percent.

The new Digital Cookie upgrade was announced in early December. It comes at a challenging time for the 103-year-old group. This year 1.88 million girls are members. Adult members number 784,120.


"Holding Barbie, the quintessential fashion doll, up as a role model for Girl Scouts simultaneously sexualizes young girls, idealizes an impossible body type, and undermines the Girl Scouts' vital mission to build 'girls of courage, confidence and character,'" said Susan Linn, director of the Boston-based commercial-free childhood organization.

## Partnership Promotes Barbie


That's the essence of the Barbie uniform patch — a bright pink oval with a gold-letter slogan stitched on it: "Be anything. Do everything."

Philleo said she admires the Girl Scouts.


"Together, we are teaching girls that their futures are wide open with possibilities," Chavez said at the time.

The Girl Scouts' national headquarters rejected the groups' request.


A psychologist who teaches at Harvard Medical School, Linn founded the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood in 2000. It now reports a membership of 54,000, many of them parents.

Girl Scouts head Anna Maria Chavez announced the partnership last year.


The group's advocacy campaigns have achieved numerous victories, notably in forcing several companies to halt or modify advertising claiming that certain videos and other products could help infants learn. It also has helped block proposed state laws that would have allowed advertising on school buses.

She said that the Girl Scouts and Mattel are teaching girls that anything is possible.


The Center for a New American Dream, a nonprofit founded in 1997, says its mission is to help Americans reduce and modify the level of consumption "to improve quality of life, protect the environment, and promote social justice."

A: Then-Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld announced on Dec. 27, 2001, that some prisoners captured in Afghanistan would be held within the bounds of the 45-square-mile U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which the United States has occupied since 1903 under a lease that gives the U.S. rights "in perpetuity." The first 20 detainees arrived Jan. 11, 2002.

## Q: Why Guantanamo?


A: According to a report by the Constitution Project, a policy research center, Pentagon officials considered a variety of Pacific island and other remote locations for holding men detained during the so-called war on terrorism that President George W. Bush declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. Officials eventually turned to Guantanamo, which previously had been used to house Haitians and Cubans who'd been picked up on the high seas trying to reach the United States.

## Q: Why are they called detainees rather than prisoners?

## Q: What are the conditions like?


A: The United States characterizes most as "unprivileged enemy belligerents," rather than prisoners of war. Under Executive Order 13492, however, detainees are supposed to be treated in a manner consistent with Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which among other things prohibits "outrages upon personal dignity." Congress also has specified certain standards through laws such as the 2005 Detainee Treatment Act, which prohibits "cruel, inhuman or degrading" treatment and requires that interrogations conform with conventional U.S. Army standards.

## Q: How much does Guantanamo cost?


Two hundred members of Congress and their families are buried at the cemetery, which is owned by Christ Church. The "congressional" in the name is because of its occupants; there's no official connection to the U.S. Congress.




Williams is trying to bring back the way people once thought of cemeteries. "In the Victorian era, cemeteries used to be a regular picnicking spot," he said, "They were like the first park system." Chris Kennedy, a board member of the cemetery's nonprofit association, lives nearby and enjoys bringing his dogs to the parklike setting, which he called a "unique and a beautiful thing." Adding goats, he said, was "a cool thing. It's historical. It's ecological."

## Not The First Cemetery Picnickers


"I would not expect that," said Carol Johnson, a National Park Service spokeswoman for National Mall and Memorial Parks. "As far as I know, it has never been considered. There could be unintended consequences of resource damage."

Mostly the contenders shared common promises to unravel many of President Barack Obama's signature accomplishments and push the country rightward. They vowed to stop the nuclear agreement with Iran, reverse Obama's immigration actions and be tougher on terrorism.

On Thursday many of the candidates attacked the leading candidate, Donald Trump. A billionaire and TV star, Trump has surprised many people. He is doing much better than expected and is now leading the polls. Still, some people feel he is not ready to be president. Unlike most of the others he has never been a governor or senator.


"Mr. Trump's language is divisive," Bush said. "We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message."

Most of the candidates promised to push the country in a more conservative direction if elected.


Trump, though, made no apologies and doubled-down with an attitude that has become increasingly familiar on the campaign trail.

## Bush Pledges To "Unite People"


Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who barely qualified for the main debate as the candidate in 10th place in national polling, said Trump had hit a nerve among Americans, and those "who want to just tune him out, they're making a mistake."

Trump's comments divide people and are not good for Republicans, Bush said. "We're going to win when we unite people."


"I'm tired of the hyphenated Americans," said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. "Immigration without assimilation is an invasion."

Trump said people were wrong to take his comments seriously. "It's fun, it's kidding, we have a good time," Trump said. "If you don't like it, I'm sorry."

Under standards-based grading, students face no penalty — pointwise — for failing to turn in homework. Instead, homework is viewed as simply a tool to help them master a subject.

## "That's Not Real Life"


New approaches to traditional grading have picked up steam in the last 15 years, an era of accountability on teachers and schools that has more recently focused on individual student growth in learning.

"That's not real life," Bozdeach said.


Such a shift has introduced discrepancies like the one at Lincoln Elementary, with results of standardized testing seeming to be at odds with how student performance is reflected in report cards.

## Better State Test Scores


"High school is free; if you fail in college, you have to pay," says Ken O'Connor, a former teacher turned author and consultant known as "The Grade Doctor." "We don't do kids any favors when we inflate their grades because at some point, they are going to fall on their face."

Tom Guskey is a professor at the University of Kentucky. He doesn't know if the new grading helps students learn more.


"The learning is what's important, it's not just the 'check off' of getting the grade in the grade book," said Karen Hargadine, executive director of pre-K and elementary education for the Rockwood School District, which has been phasing in the standards-based model.

Williams says the new grading played a big part.

Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis claims debt relief is the key issue that held up a deal with creditors last week and says he'd rather cut off his arm than sign anything that doesn't tackle the country's borrowings.

Who helped Germany then? Greece.


The IMF backed the call to make Greece's debt manageable with a wide-ranging report on Thursday that also blames the Greek government for being slow with reforms.

In 1953, Greece and about 20 other countries forgave much of Germany's debt. Soon Germany's economy became strong again.


The deal effectively blocked claims for reparations for the destruction the Nazis inflicted on others.

Greece wants the same chance that was given to Germany.


The study was led by Kristian K. Kjeldsen of the Natural History Museum of Denmark at the University of Copenhagen. The complex work involved inferring the loss of mass of the total ice sheet over a very large stretch of time using a merger of multiple information sources:  the distinct marks left by retreating glaciers on the landscape, extensive aerial photography from 1978 through 1987, and -- beginning in 1983 -- satellite and aircraft observations.

Other scientists studying a seismically active area of southern Monterey County near Parkfield observed that there are often more earthquakes during dry months than during wet months. The number of earthquakes there every year has roughly doubled between 1984 and 2005.

"It's really opening up a possibility that humans are changing stresses on faults," Amos said. "It's a simple realization that human use of groundwater is having small but perhaps measurable impacts on the San Andreas fault."

Susan Hough studies earthquakes. She said the idea that less groundwater can lead to earthquakes is very possible.


Now, embroidered Mayan textiles known as huipiles are undergoing a revival in some of the country's finest boutiques as they become a haute couture fixture. Young Guatemalan designers are using them for everything from evening gowns and purses to handmade shoes sold as far away as Dubai.

In modern times, their colorful textiles have made them a target for unfair treatment. The textiles marked them as poor and part of a downtrodden people.


Guatemalan rapper Tzutu Baktun Kan saw a larger cultural move toward his country's indigenous roots, harkening back to the first millennium when present-day Guatemala sat in the heart of the Mayan empire.

"I am inspired by color," Figueroa said. "Guatemalan textiles are rich in color."


Eduardo Ortiz, a high-couture clothing designer, said he doesn't use traditional Guatemalan textiles because they aren't his style and because he thinks some Guatemalans won't accept them.

Karim Corzo is a shoe designer in Guatamala. He said the popularity of traditional textiles helps the communities that have made the fabrics for a long time.


"When you are outside of the country you think it's beautiful but by modernizing these traditional textiles we are getting Guatemalans (in the country) to wear them," Corzo said.

Eduardo Ortiz, a high-fashion clothing designer, says he will not use traditional Guatemalan textiles. They aren't his style. Also, some Guatemalans won't accept them. They think they look too old fashioned.


When she first started out farming in 2007, Zoe Bradbury thought she had enough money budgeted and planned for various expenses, from greenhouses to irrigation systems. She was fortunate because she was able to farm on her mother's land along the southern Oregon coast. But the money evaporated pretty quickly, so she tried to get a small loan through the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) — only to be turned down.

As Chris Newman sees it, he and his wife "hit the lottery" when it came to getting land. Chris is a Piscataway Indian. He was eager to farm as his ancestors once did. That means avoiding loans, pesticides, fertilizers and expensive equipment.


"We definitely cannot let our guard down," said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's certainly possible we will have more cases and more clusters in the coming months."

"That cursed disease separated me from that which is most beautiful to me in my life," she said. "But it's over. We are turning a page on Ebola, definitively."

"We definitely cannot let our guard down," said Dr. Tom Frieden. "It's certainly possible we will have more cases" in the next few months, he said.


WHO declares that Ebola disease transmission has ended when the country goes through two incubation periods — 21 days each — without a new case emerging.

"Guinea is a blessed country," said Ibrahima Sow, who beat the disease. Sow said he hopes no other terrible disease outbreak will strike the country. 


Frieden also warned that if it persists or re-emerges in animals, a transmission to humans is still possible.

"That cursed disease separated me from that which is most beautiful to me in my life," she said. "But it's over."

OUANAMINTHE, Haiti — Thousands of people from Haiti or merely of Haitian descent aren't waiting to see if they will be forcibly removed from the Dominican Republic now that the deadline has passed to apply for legal residency.

OUANAMINTHE, Haiti — Thousands of people are leaving the Dominican Republic for Haiti.


Pedro Cano, coordinator of the Jesuit Migrant Service in the Dominican border town of Jimani, said abrupt deportation can be devastating for people who have spent years, sometimes their entire lives, in the Dominican Republic.

"It's complicated, you spend a lot of money, and you don't get your papers," said Miguelle Saint Juste, a construction worker.


Before last month's deadline, some Dominican officials warned they would conduct immigration sweeps and showed off a fleet of buses for deportations. But mass deportations have not materialized and the government now says repatriations will be done only after individually checking the documents of each immigrant.

"This is an incredibly important public health issue," said Joan Luby, professor of psychiatry at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. After studying 145 children over 12 years, she authored an article about the effect of poverty on children's brains in the journal JAMA Pediatrics in October.

Harsh parenting is as dangerous as lead poisoning, said Daniel Taylor. He is a doctor in North Philadelphia. Lead is a poisonous metal that can harm a child's brain.


Think of harsh parenting as an agent as destructive as lead poisoning, said Daniel Taylor, a pediatrician at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia.

Harsh parenting often involves "quick 'do-as-I-say' orders from Mom or Dad," Taylor said. A loving relationship helps to shield children from toxic stress, even when their parents yell. When parents are too consistently harsh, their children's brains release stress chemicals. Usually, these chemicals are released when a person is in danger. These chemicals are toxic, or poisonous, to developing brains.


Toxic stress also damages the hippocampus, a part of the brain that affects memory, he said, so such children may have trouble remembering things, which impairs reading ability and test performance.

If toxic chemicals are released constantly, children will be more likely to develop heart disease, said Marcy Witherspoon. She is an expert on how children's brains develop.

At Bard, those who help teach the inmates aren't particularly surprised by their success.

The contest took place at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility. It is a prison with many locks and guards. People who have committed crimes, who are called inmates, live here.


"There are few teams we are prouder of having lost a debate to than the phenomenally intelligent and articulate team we faced this weekend," they wrote. "And we are incredibly thankful to Bard and the Eastern New York Correctional Facility for the work they do and for organizing this event."

In 2014, the Harvard debate team won a world championship.


Inmates can earn various degrees through the initiative, which is taught primarily by Bard faculty. About 15 percent of the all-male inmates at the Eastern New York Correctional Facility in Napanoch are enrolled. Graduates of the program have continued their studies at Yale and Columbia universities, Kenner said.

As the controversy spread across the state, into the press and onto social media, it has evoked both rancor and introspection about cultural sensitivity in the scientific community. Some scientists have compared telescope opposition to religious fanaticism and accused critics of preventing progress; others questioned whether the construction of the telescope is colonialism of a different sort. Meanwhile, Hawaii residents of all ethnicities are fiercely debating whether benefits brought by the project — jobs, tourism, a $1 million-per-year lease, better views of the universe's outer reaches and distant path than any we've seen before — outweigh the potential costs to their cultural heritage.

That's because Mauna Kea is one of the most important natural landmarks in Hawaiian culture, which flourishes in the islands despite efforts by missionaries in the 19th century to suppress it. Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, who ruled Hawaii before the United States annexed the islands in 1898, now represent only 10 percent of the state's population.

"Mauna Kea in every respect represents the zenith of the Native Hawaiian people's ancestral ties to Creation itself," she wrote in a post for the Hawaiian Environmental Alliance. "... When the land, the waters, the life forms suffer, we feel this suffering, the process of creation begins to unravel and de-creation begins. The law, the kanawai, is broken. We lose our place in time and space and then we are lost."

Bryan Kamaoli Kuwada is a Native Hawaiian. He wrote that any time native people try to protect their holy places, they are called old-fashioned and against science.


KALAPANA, Hawaii — On an overcast Monday afternoon, Aku Hauanio is seated on a picnic table in front of his Uncle Robert's house — one of the few structures in town spared 25 years ago by Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes in the world.

KALAPANA, Hawaii — Lava flowing from the Hawaiian volcano Kilauea destroyed many buildings in Kalapana 25 years ago. Aku Hauanio's father's house was one of them. The volcano is threatening homes once again, including the one he now lives in.


He remembers being a 2 a.m. spectator as the molten flow entered the house through the back, took down the water tank and set the modest structure ablaze.

## Lava Takes A Slow Path


When his father's house was burned by the lava that night in 1991, Hauanio, 62, a former Hawaii Volcanoes National Park employee, remembers watching in stunned amazement with his former wife. "We just was like, 'Wow.' And then we went home," he said.

## Just Like The Moon!


His own house was safe for the moment, but Hauanio was resigned to the fact that it would be next to go. His children, however, weren't. They begged him to move the structure to secure ground, the way parishioners had relocated the nearby Star of the Sea Catholic church months earlier.

Many wonder what to do. Hauanio and others still living down the road in Kalapana already know the answer. They wait, watch, then move.

"From humble and idealistic beginnings a decade ago, open-access scientific journals have mushroomed into a global industry, driven by author publication fees rather than traditional subscriptions," wrote Bohannon, a molecular biologist and science reporter.

Many of the most famous journals work under the older pay-to-read model. Open-access journals started from the idea that scientific research should be available to more people. And many more have popped up in the past 10 years. Some have been criticized for not following the same rules of "peer review." Under peer review, scientists check for errors before an article is published.

"We're all in agreement that the number of families with kids that need some type of housing assistance has gone up," Ho said. "But the number of families who are in shelters or on the streets on any given night have actually gone down. I think they're both true. And we all agree that there aren't sufficient investments in affordable housing or services for anyone who's homeless."

"They are the group at greatest risk," DeCandia said.


Poverty, of course, is the great driver of homelessness. Homeless children are typically part of a family headed by a single mother in her 20s who has limited education and a spotty employment history — and who usually has a history of trauma, such as domestic violence. Many avoid going to shelters for as long as possible because they don't want to expose their children to shelter life or they are afraid the family will be split up.

The hidden homeless are not living on the street, she said. Instead, they may be moving place to place, staying with another family or living in a shelter.


In 2009, the Illinois state legislature earmarked $3 million for homeless school children. Since then, that line item was a casualty of the state's tight budget, Nix-Hodes said, despite efforts by the governor and the state Department of Education.

In another closely watched category, homelessness among veterans dropped 6 percent countywide, to about 4,400, but the report did not break out a comparable number for the city.

More than 44,000 homeless people were counted in January, the new report said. In 2013, the city and county had around 39,000 homeless people.

"I feel like we should have homework in every class," she said, explaining that would give "more learning and just a better chance to understand things and take advantage of it."

He doesn't think the homework helps because he learns from paying attention in class. "I get it done because it's another grade that helps me get an A."


Amma Ababio, of Highland Park, an 11th-grader at Pittsburgh Allderdice High School who is taking advanced classes, figures she does homework from about 5 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on school nights. She said her phone is off, her computer is off except for research and she even does homework while she eats dinner.

## Too Little Homework?


But some Hong Kongers are calling for greater expressions of support from overseas. A group of Hong Kong-based employees of Apple wrote to Chief Executive Tim Cook, calling for active support of the civil disobedience campaign.

Hua Chunying is a spokeswoman for the Chinese government. She warned other countries not to interfere.


"The people of Hong Kong are now under the violent treatment of the Central government, while fighting for the human rights and democracy of Hong Kong," they wrote. They asked Apple, as "the most humanized and the most respectful company, to support and help our civil disobedience campaign, and also to respond to the fight of Hong Kong people."

"Hong Kong belongs to China," she said. "We strongly oppose any countries interfering or supporting Occupy Central by any methods. We wish these countries to be cautious."


"This is kind of cheating," Kara Brick, 28, says. "We are all ex-smokers. With cigarettes, you really have to push through smoking it the first time. They taste terrible and smell terrible. Hookah is actually enjoyable. This has a social feel and is something we can do together."

"I smoked every weekend. I never considered how bad it would be for me," Doss said.


Five years ago, Farhad Ata opened Kush Hookah Lounge.

"It is still tobacco, no matter what, even if it is flavored," Ata said. "Your lungs are meant for air. Any type of smoke is not good for you, whether it's cigarettes or hookah."

"There is no quick fix," said BLM spokesman Tom Gorey. "The options are limited because we're not going to put down healthy horses for which there is no adoption demand, even though the law authorizes it."

## Horses Versus Ranchers


The Bureau of Land Management pays the Mustang Heritage Foundation $3.75 million to train some of the wild horses and put them up for auction, a program that led to 868 of the adoptions last year. The foundation is in the midst of an adoption event at the John Justin Arena in Fort Worth, with 150 of the horses going up for bid Friday and the same number Sunday. The average sale price is under $500.

The government could find homes for only about 2,600 animals. It found homes for more than twice as many in 2005. Getting somebody to take the animals has become harder. People are not spending much money right now in the country.


In the past six months, the Kankakee center has received at least a dozen calls asking for help with horses hit by cars, running at large or suspected of being neglected, she said.

## No Room At The Pound


According to the state's Humane Care for Animals Act, cases of abuse or neglect — known as humane care calls — can be investigated in several ways.

"I can't keep a horse on this property," said Julie Boudreau of the Kankakee County Animal Control and Adoption Center. "I don't really know of any animal control agencies that have the ability to care for all species of animals."


Today, five investigators handle animal complaints from across the state, with each responsible for as many as 15 counties. Last year, 969 humane care complaints were made to the bureau, Squibb said.

## It's Up To Lawmakers


In June, 30 member of the House of Representatives urged new U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell to reform the government's wild horse management program and its spiraling budget, which is dominated by the high cost of corralling and removing the animals from the range.

## "BLM Is Galloping Ahead"


For most of its history, the world regarded it as junk from the sea. Bounties were sometimes placed on its helmeted head to stop it from grazing on more appetizing clams. And in the mid-1800s, between 1.5 and 2 million were caught yearly to use as fertilizer and livestock feed, according to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission.

The horseshoe crab is not really a crab at all but a relative of the spider. It is one of the oldest unchanged species on Earth known to scientists. It's older than the continents, and exists only in parts of Asia and North America's Atlantic coast.


When the females cross the "stag line," they pick up a mate, then tow it in. Males who don't hook up may become "satellites," circling the couple and helping fertilize the eggs, according to University of Florida researcher Jane Brockmann, who has spent 25 years studying the crabs in the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge.

## Pit Stop For Birds


A scientific study of the problem to support with numbers what backers believe to be true.

Coming up with a plan to teach horticulture in schools and in college;


"We have to come up with a game plan. Period," said Redman, who has been in horticulture for three decades and who still has to define for people what that means.

"We have to come up with a game plan. Period," said Redman, who has been in horticulture for 30 years, but still has to explain to people what that means.


In a report in May, the Royal Horticultural Society decried "an alarming shortage of skilled professionals" in horticulture jobs, posing "a threat to Britain's economy, environment, and food security."

The problem isn't only in the United States, as Meyer discovered while teaching in England over the summer: England, the world's horticultural powerhouse, faces the same problems.


(In another sign of the times, 18 months ago at Penn State, the agronomic and turf scientists merged with the horticulturists to form the plant sciences department.)

Matthew Bond, 21, studies plant sciences at Cornell University. He found his future the old-fashioned way: He grew up in farm country in Ogdensburg, N.Y., where his father and grandmother were excited about gardening.


"There's nothing sexy about plant science until you make it so for kids. Once you do, they're hooked," said Jessica McAtamney, who teaches environmental science and urban gardening at W.B. Saul High School in Philadelphia.

Douglas C. Needham, education department head at Longwood, said, "I'm passionate about this. I don't want to see the art, science, and craft of horticulture die out."

While boozing and drugging his way through several colleges, he said, he parlayed his self-taught crossbreeding skills into producing potent marijuana plants. "Anybody can do it," he said of crossbreeding plants. "All you do is follow the scientific method."

"Agh ... I'm ... losing ... the ... ability ... to ... talk," Currie said, gasping.


He began crossbreeding peppers after reading scientific papers suggesting that their chemical compounds might reduce the risk of heart attacks and cancer, two diseases that run in his family, Currie said.

His throat was on fire. His face was blood red. His eyes watered. He swallowed the rest of the Reaper and gulped down cold water. "Eating them whole like that is just stupid," he said.


"Tongs," Redding said.

Why?


That's because of how batteries work. A battery is essentially a high school chemistry experiment in a small metal tube: two metals immersed in an electrolyte solvent and partitioned by an all-important separator. The anode (the negatively charged end of the battery) accumulates electrons, the tiny negatively charged particles that form an electric current. The electrolyte solvent allows ions - atoms lacking one electron - to accumulate in the cathode (the positively charged end).

The problem, it seems, is the batteries.


Lithium ion batteries make doubly good on this process with the ability to reverse it. When you recharge one, the reaction flows the other way: the anode re-accumulates electrons, the difference in charges reappears. They are lightweight and endlessly reusable, which makes them appealing for electronics ranging from cellphones to electric cars.

## Explosive Technology


The requirement violates our Constitution's ringing declaration of individual freedom. It forces students to spend numerous hours each month away from the classroom engaging in government-approved public service projects like recycling, cleaning up trash in poor neighborhoods and even attending re-education sessions to ensure they are marching in step with the political goose-steppers of the progressive left.

They created a system of government that was self-correcting. Although it is often late, our country has continued to correct past mistakes over its 239-year history. It leads to a better nation — a more perfect union.


He's right, of course, and that's exactly why the curricula for American history should be formulated at the local, not national level.

## A Citizenship Test?


While noting progress among subgroups of students, the latest figures drew concern from groups campaigning for a 90 percent graduation rate by 2020. To reach that goal, the rate needs to increase each year by at least 1.3 percent — a mark that the nation has met for the previous three years but missed for the 2013-14 school year.

## First, The Good News


The shopping curbs, which take effect March 15, will mostly affect big-box retailers and major European grocery chains such as Spar, Aldi, Tesco and Lidl.

Linda Estrada, president and director of Animal Welfare League in Chicago Ridge, Illinois, said she also agreed with banning drones to hunt.

John Bostic owns a business that guides hunters. He has been hunting for more than 40 years. He said he is in favor of banning drones for hunting in Illinois.


Some hunting guide businesses, however, are in favor of being able to use drones to scout for animals.

Linda Estrada said she also agreed with preventing hunters from using drones. Estrada runs the Animal Welfare League in Illinois.


Scouting involves exploring a possible hunting area ahead of time to gather information on animal whereabouts, herd or flock sizes and best potential hunting vantages. Currently in hunting, that is the most likely use for a drone, which can be outfitted with video equipment to transmit images and information from the wilderness back to an operator.

"The animal wouldn't have a chance whatsoever," she said.


Kevin Wood, a University of Washington research scientist aboard the plane, said the Arctic heat release also might trigger other extreme weather events, such as flooding or severe snowstorms.

Nick Bond is a scientist at the University of Washington. He was a passenger on the plane.


In October 2012, Sandy emerged in the Caribbean as a tropical storm, grew into a hurricane and initially began to curve northeast on a path that would have taken it toward the North Atlantic.

Bond said the faster the Arctic ice builds up, the more heat is released into the atmosphere.


"We know we obtained data that was unique and important," Bond said. "We're greedy, and we want more."
## Hurricane Helper


"It wasn't hard to leave. It was hard to come back and find this," Morfin Garcia said. "So much work to build something. It makes me very sad, but what can we do with these natural phenomena?"

They were thankful that everyone survived. "It's something to tell the grandchildren," Reyna Ruiz said.


"We were fortunate as to where it made landfall. It was not a densely populated area," said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and spokesman for the U.S. National Hurricane Center. "You and I would be having a very different conversation if this went over the top of Puerto Vallarta."

"It was hard to come back and find this," Morfin Garcia said. "So much work to build something. It makes me very sad."


He said the lack of fatalities was probably the result of the storm's narrow footprint. Category 5 winds extended 15 miles out on either side of the eye, and hurricane-force winds extended for 35 miles from the center of the storm.

## Resort Town Escaped Everything But Rain


On Saturday, Patricia's maximum sustained winds had dropped to 30 mph (45 kph), according to the hurricane center. The storm's remnants were expected to feed into existing rain hitting southern Texas.

About 200,000 people live in Puerto Vallarta. The population includes thousands of Americans. The city was hardly touched by the storm. After the hurricane passed, people snapped selfies. Business owners swept sidewalks as they would on any morning.


Hurricanes can spawn tornadoes: Twisters typically form on the outer edges of hurricanes, especially in or ahead of the storm's most powerful part — its front right quadrant. In 1988, Hurricane Gilbert's eye passed into Mexico but spawned 41 tornadoes in Texas. Several hit San Antonio, about 350 miles from landfall.

The strongest winds of Hurricane Frances stayed in Florida's Treasure Coast on the Atlantic Ocean. Only a tiny corner of Palm Beach County experienced hurricane-force gusts. But the storm pounded that area for two days, and did as much damage as a stronger, shorter storm.


But what damage would a high-end tornado visit on South Florida? Not as much, an engineer said. "In Florida, the homes are built to be wind resistant, and in the Midwest, less so," said Remington Brown, senior engineering manager for the Tampa-based Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety.

## Rains Lead To Flooding


We know a little bit about how hydrogen's physical state changes under different conditions. Hydrogen can be liquefied at extremely cold temperatures, and has long been used as liquid rocket fuel. At high temperatures like those found in the corona of the sun, the atom's electrons are stripped from the protons, forming an ionized gas known as plasma.

## To Solidify, Hydrogen Needs Extreme Pressure, Mild Temperatures


"One can get much larger surges where the offshore waters are shallow, as is true along the west, but not the east coast of Florida. Also, surges can amplify by being funneled into bays," Emanuel said in an email.

## Florida's Shallow Waters Put Tampa Bay In Danger


Indeed, it found that with 3,100 simulated events in today's climate, it is theoretically possible to get a hurricane with winds of over 250 mph — stronger than anything we've seen on Earth — and a storm surge of 7.4 meters (24 feet) affecting Dubai. Granted, it is hard to emphasize enough that this is a rare phenomenon — storms like this have "return periods of the order of 30,000-200,000 years," the study said.

In Cairns, Australia, the study showed an 18-foot storm surge is possible even in today's climate. It also suggests that an extremely powerful hurricane could happen in the Persian Gulf. That area has never had a hurricane.


Martinez, a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that the symbolism of their action was important, even if critics have called the action unwise, and that someone had to take a stand. "We've been accused of being petulant children," she said. "We realize that it had to be us."

"We should not forget the people who have been deported," Mateo said.


By returning to Mexico voluntarily, the three immigrants have put themselves at considerable risk. Under an immigration reform package backed by the Obama administration, young immigrants deported could apply to return to the U.S. Those who leave voluntarily would not have that option, immigration experts say.

Mateo, Saavedra and Martinez walked from Nogales, Mexico to Nogales, Ariz. in graduation caps and gowns. Five other immigrants came along, also dressed for graduation. Four of them had left the U.S. years ago on their own because life had become too difficult. The fifth was deported.


Immigration authorities offered Saavedra and Mateo the chance to apply for the Obama administration's deferred deportation program, which allows immigrants brought into the country illegally as children to stay in the U.S., at least temporarily.

Leon came to the U.S. when he was 5. He had been living in North Carolina and returned to Mexico in 2011 because he thought the immigration system would never be fixed. He regrets that now. He's tried, and failed, to return to the U.S. six times.


The greatest challenge may be the educational requirement. Many of those yet to apply are farmworkers, one in three of whom has less than a ninth-grade education. In the Central Valley, as many as half of immigrants may need more schooling to apply for deferred action. The figure for California is 30 percent, according to the Immigration Policy Center.

Early applicants tended to be college-educated. Some don't realize they are allowed to apply, they think the program is just for college students. Others may fear coming forward, or are waiting to see if Washington will pardon undocumented immigrants. The $465 application fee is steep for a minimum-wage worker. And to prove that an immigrant really has put down roots in the United States, they must provide stacks of paperwork.


"You're here!" someone shouted. Some of the freed activists and their supporters cried. The five women came off the bus first. They wore graduation gowns and mortar boards, the same attire as when they were arrested last month while trying to cross from Mexico back into the U.S. Next came the four men, dressed in street clothes.

## Wearing Caps And Gowns


Life in Mexico was difficult, Peniche said; she was targeted because she'd lived so long in the U.S. She was relieved to be free, and grateful to be back in the U.S., she said. "It's amazing. I feel like I have so much freedom here. I can be myself and not be afraid," she said.

Mateo and two others voluntarily crossed into Mexico before trying to re-enter the United States as an act of protest. The other six were attempting to return after leaving for Mexico more than a year ago for various reasons.


Martinez, 23, was brought to the U.S. at age 3. She said she endured her recent detention by thinking of her family.

## Relieved To Be Free


Kristyn Peck, a refugee programs official with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, fields calls from school administrators seeking a better understanding of the students.

Patricia Chiancone, an outreach counselor in Maryland, says she hears stories of hardship. She hears stories of girls being raped on the journey into the United States and siblings and parents killed by gangs back home.


"They have multilayered trauma," Peck said. "They often experience trauma which propelled them and motivated them to leave in the first place. Then they experience trauma along the journey, and then often the experience at border patrol can be traumatic for them. These are really special kids with a lot of needs."

"We see death certificates and we see letters that a minister wrote saying this child left because he was being threatened by this," Chiancone said.


Patricia Chiancone, an outreach counselor in the international counseling office in Prince George's County, Maryland, says she hears stories of hardship, including girls being raped on the journey into the United States, siblings and parents killed in gang violence back home and teen brothers from rural Guatemala who left home after their farm harvest was destroyed.

Coughlin's school allows students learning English to stay into their 20s. In the past two years, it has seen a rise in the number of students who crossed the border alone. He says many children work long hours at night to pay for lawyers.


"Sometimes, I tried to give up because it was a lot of language I had to learn," he said. "It was really hard for me because I had to work and then school. That would make me more tired."

## There Is Always Hope


"I am not with a coyote," he said, referring to the paid human traffickers who usher some migrants northward. "I'm just trying to guide myself through instinct."

"I am not with a coyote," he said. Coyotes are the paid human guides who help some illegal immigrants cross the border. "I'm just trying to guide myself through instinct."


Young said the average age of unaccompanied children apprehended by border agents has dropped. "There are a lot more kids under age 12, and the percentage of girls has risen from 25 percent to 40 percent," she said.

## "No Avalanche Of Minors"


"I think the goals these kids have are safety and reunifying with family. I don't think they are necessarily trying to game the system," said Elizabeth Frankel, a law professor and associate director of the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights at the University of Chicago.

The Rev. Alejandro Solalinde is a Catholic priest who is perhaps Mexico's best known advocate for migrants. He said that when teens take off from Central America, they "band together with others from their hometowns. Nobody protects them."


"He said to them, 'You should think about what you can do for Honduras.' They just exploded," Solalinde recalled, describing the reaction of migrants who told the consul general that the government has done little to rein in criminals, forcing them to leave their homeland.

"There's no avalanche of minors," Vigne said.


South Carolina in particular has a unique view, having seen the greatest percentage increase in Hispanic population in the country from 2000 to 2010 — nearly 150 percent, according to the most recently available census data. Although its Hispanic population sits at a comparatively low 5.1 percent, the increase reflects decisions by immigrants to make the trek deeper into the U.S. And while many are taking temporary seasonal work, the labor shortage has become a permanent issue for growers and workers alike.

Far from the border, it is harder to get immigrant workers. In the orchards and fields of South Carolina, farmers need more workers to pick fruit. "There's truly not enough farmworkers now, legal or illegal," said Chalmers Carr. He owns Titan Farms. It is the East Coast's largest peach farm.


"We're losing that aging population, but we're also not getting anybody replacing them because of the mess we have at the border and no immigration law," said Manuel Cunha Jr., the president of California's Nisei Farmers League, which represents over 180 types of farms, including those that produce raisins, vegetables and flowers.

"It might be a seasonal job. But we're going to keep having grapes that need to be picked and cows that need to be milked," Tramonte said. "And immigrants are coming to do that sort of labor."


"In northern Ohio, we're on the front lines, and it's not because we're on the northern border," said Mark Gilson, the owner and operator of Gilson Gardens, a nursery in northeastern Ohio, which relies largely on seasonal immigrant workers. "It's because the agricultural jobs are here."

"We're losing that aging population. But we're also not getting anybody replacing them because of the mess we have at the border and no immigration law," said Manuel Cunha Jr. He is the president of California's Nisei Farmers League. The group represents 180 different types of farms.

"This is not just my story," Rubio said. "This is our story. It reminds us that we are 'E Pluribus Unum.' Out of many, one."

"That day is today. And while I am sad that Senator Kennedy isn't here to see history made, I know he is looking down on us proudly. He is not alone," Reid said as he closed the debate.


After 10 years, the status could again be adjusted. Immigrants would have to meet new requirements, including proficiency in English and a new $1,000 fine. Three years after that, in most cases, they could achieve citizenship. Before green cards are issued to those with provisional legal status, though, five security-related conditions would need to be met.

## 13-Year Path To Citizenship


"The gap between Mississippi and New Mexico and Massachusetts is pretty huge," said Laura Speer, the foundation's associate director for policy reform and advocacy. "Just looking at that component across the country can tell you a lot about the economic vitality of those places and how educated their workforces are going to be."

Students in all but six states improved in reading.


Children from lower-income families fared worse on reading than those from higher-income families in every state, but the gap was largest in the District of Columbia, Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Fourth-graders in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Rhode Island had the most improvement. Reading ability went down in four states. They were Alaska, Michigan, South Dakota and West Virginia. Reading ability remained the same in Connecticut and Montana. Connecticut had the most fourth-graders reading at grade level in 2003.


Those income disparities are worrisome for several reasons, said Sarah Clark, an associate research scientist at the University of Michigan's Child Health Evaluation and Research Unit (CHEAR).

## Who Makes The Team?


The problems have prompted education officials to take preventive measures that at first blush might seem worthy of a minimum-security prison. Some schools installed closed-circuit cameras to monitor testing rooms. Others posted armed police officers at entrances or employed jamming devices to block the use of cellphones to trade answers.

Teachers and school officials say that millions of students take the board exams each year, and very few of them cheat.


"For the major part of the exam, he was not present in the class," Sarvesh recalled. "There was open passing of information, noise and even discussions. I remember verifying most of my answers with my friends."

"One hundred percent, we can stop this problem," said Lakshmikant Pande. He is head of the board of education in the western state of Maharashtra. "If we continue these types of efforts over two or three years, surely we can stop this."

India has declared that it wants to end child labor, but advocacy groups argue that a new government proposal could actually push more youngsters into the workforce, jeopardizing their education and putting them at greater risk of exploitation.

## Poor Families Need Their Children To Work


Trade unions back the initiative, saying it is in line with International Labor Organization conventions that require countries to set a minimum working age of at least 14 and bar employment that would damage children's health or well-being.

The new rules might actually increase the number of child workers, Deshmukh said.


But to that universal question "Coffee or tea?" Cariappa, like most Indians, has always answered, "Tea."

Tarun Cariappa's family has a farm. The family grows coffee, not tea, and has for many years.


"Dad and Mom started their day with a cup of tea," Cariappa said as he surveyed a patch of leafy plants studded with bright-red coffee cherries. "So I've never drunk coffee."

The farm has dark green coffee bushes. Around them are towering fruit trees — and sometimes a wild elephant.


Ask for a cup of joe in most of India, though, and you'll get instant coffee crystals drowning in hot milk and sugar, or served over ice with even more sugar. So few Indians drink brewed coffee that virtually all its best crop is exported to countries such as Italy, where the beans are used in name-brand espresso blends and sold at a huge markup.

## "I've Never Drunk Coffee"


Now, however, a handful of Indian farmers and entrepreneurs are trying to hook some of their compatriots on coffee by selling gourmet, freshly roasted Indian beans to a burgeoning urban middle class.

"Dad and Mom started their day with a cup of tea," Cariappa said as he looked over leafy plants studded with bright-red coffee cherries. "So I've never drunk coffee."


"I feel like there's some identity to my coffee now," Cariappa said. "Where the bulk of it goes once it's exported, I still have no idea, but those who buy from Kunal know where Appa's is coming from."

Cariappa hasn't even tasted the brewed coffee.


The effort to build a domestic market for Indian-grown coffee is among the latest signs of this country's economic expansion. It also represents a bid to lift farmers from the bottom of the supply chain and connect them with Indian consumers who have long viewed coffee as an exotic luxury item.

"And you didn't even take a picture!" Cariappa joked.


The shade-grown coffee bushes that spill across the gently sloping hillsides of southern India are, for most farmers, simply a cash crop, Ross said. He compared it to West African cocoa whose farmers have never tasted chocolate.

Cariappa said he still does not know where most of his coffee goes when it is sold outside of India.


The growth has accelerated with the success of two chains that sell mass-market Indian coffee: Cafe Coffee Day, a Bangalore-based company with more than 1,600 outlets nationwide, and Starbucks, which arrived in 2012 and brews its espresso drinks exclusively with coffee from Indian farms owned by its corporate partner, the Tata Coffee conglomerate.

"I tell them it doesn't work like that," he said. "There's still some education that has to be done."

Television footage showed stranded people climbing down cliffs, aided by soldiers. Around 73,000 people have been evacuated so far.

## Finding People, Dropping Food Supplies


Numerous accounts of death and devastation have emerged in the disaster's aftermath.

## More Rains Coming


"We were scared of dying and just kept running for our lives. We don't know how many kilometers we ran. People kept telling us to run to save our lives," another survivor said.

A private helicopter being used to rescue stranded people crashed late Friday. There were no deaths.


"I have been here for the past three days to get some information about my missing father and mother. But there is no official here to help us. It's an endless wait," Brajesh Singh said.

"The center of faith has turned into a burial ground. Bodies are scattered in the area," state agriculture minister Harak Singh Rawat told reporters.


The steps India needs to take are evident, the critics said, but they are politically difficult. They include cutting subsidies and other populist welfare policies that drive up government deficits; reducing red tape, opaque regulations and inconsistent tax policies that deter investors; intervening in currency markets earlier; and addressing a string of corruption scandals in the defense, real estate, telecommunications, mining and sports sectors.

## Gold Everywhere, Even On A Car


It's tough to change a culture that believes gold should mark every phase of life, from birth to dowry to childbirth to death, said Partha Nath Mukherji, professor emeritus of sociology at New Delhi's Institute of Social Sciences.

## Just Won't Stop Buying The Stuff


After dark, when the wind rustles the palm trees and sugar cane fields, Bankar draws a simple gray curtain across his front doorway, holding the billowy fabric in place with a slab of plywood. The main threat of intrusion, he said, comes from stray dogs and snakes.

The only bank in town has a see-through front door that remains unlocked day and night. Only the safe-deposit box is locked. This is where people keep their valuables.


If the town is so safe, these skeptics ask, why does the temple's donation box have a lock?

The police station does have doors. Out of respect for the legend of Shani, it has no locks.

The country's resistance problems have arisen, paradoxically, because India has made great strides against the nonresistant form of the disease. Beginning in the 1990s India adopted a WHO-developed program called "Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course," or DOTS. It is designed to ensure poorly educated patients in the developing world properly complete the 6-month-long, first-line TB treatment. Through a huge network of volunteer "DOT providers" the RNTCP has managed to dispense the free treatment to corners of the country where the nearest hospital lies hundreds of kilometers away. It boosted the detection rate for new cases above 70 percent in 2010 and it is targeting 90 percent this year. And it has achieved a treatment success rate of 88 percent for the patients it identifies, according to RNTCP documents.

By quickly switching drugs, Nisha's original doctors made the TB in her body grow stronger. The bacteria became more resistant to several different drugs.


Nor does the country have a good sense of how big the resistance problem really is. Because of the small number of diagnostic laboratories there's no way of knowing how the proportion of XDR-TB patients here compares with central Asian and eastern European countries like Lithuania— where nearly a quarter of MDR-TB patients actually have XDR-TB. But the sheer numbers of new TB infections every year, together with the tardy government response, suggest the problem may soon be larger here. A nationwide drug-resistance survey should provide more data in 2016, according to Pai. But the evidence that is available suggests XDR-TB will be "a sizable fraction of all MDR" in cities like Mumbai — although it will remain low in rural areas.

It seemed an unusual request, particularly on the frenetic, less-than-pristine streets of India's commercial capital. Who in this city has time to stop and get his ear cleaned? And who would think of having it done on the street, by a man with a battered leather satchel of unmarked vials dangling from his shoulder?

Mehboob is undisturbed by the noise and rush all around him. He slides a smaller stool toward a visitor.

Their descendants flourished amid the rich marine environment. In 1542, explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo counted several densely populated villages as he sailed past, and there were many more he didn't see.

"The last time one of these planks was found was in the 1960s," said Jon M. Erlandson. He is an archaeologist at the University of Oregon. Erlandson is an expert on Santa Cruz Island's cultural items.


"We weren't deliberately looking for it. Why would we?" said Burrows, who conducted the research with University of Bristol engineer Gregory Sutton. "There's been no description of gear wheels functioning in animals before."

## Incredibly Fast Jumpers


To figure out what made these insects so springy, the researchers ventured outdoors to gather a few bugs, with a little help from the sharp eyes of Burrows' young grandson. Some of the planthoppers were adults, and some were nymphs.

"We weren't deliberately looking for it. Why would we?" said Burrows, who works at the University of Cambridge. He ran the study with University of Bristol engineer Gregory Sutton. "There's been no description of gear wheels functioning in animals before."


"Any statement that you make like that, that something is uniquely human is just waiting to be disproven," Full said.
If you break a tooth on a gear in your car or your bike, you have to get it fixed. Nymphs don't have repair shops. But, because they shed their bodies into larger and larger exoskeletons as they grow, they're constantly getting upgrades anyway. Exoskeletons are shells that some animals grow around their bodies. Once they're adults, their bodies don't change, so they can't upgrade to a new exoskeleton.

The environment is changing, and the Inuit, who consider themselves a part of it, want measures taken to protect their culture. A report issued this month by the Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska, which advocates for Inuit coastal villages from southwest to north Alaska, calls for policies that protect Inuit traditional food and the Arctic environment that produces it.

The only known way to keep lionfish populations in check here, scientists say, is human removal.

Klitzkie at REEF says there's no way to get rid of all the lionfish. But their numbers can be controlled.

Last week, Iranian lawmakers officially signed off on the nuclear deal, signaling an end to what has often been an incendiary debate.

## President Asks Iran To Wait Until Spring


"I just hope people have more money to spend so they can invest more in decorating their homes," said Parisa Jalili, 24, an interior decorator who was with her boyfriend, Ramin Haderi, at the Naderi restaurant, a bohemian haunt close to the British Embassy.

"Nothing will ever change here," Reza said.


Many in Iran's young and highly educated population have found it difficult to find employment commensurate with their skills and education levels.

## Young Iranians Show More Confidence In Future


At Friday prayers on the grounds of Tehran University, a leading cleric, 88-year-old Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, warned that Western values — including homosexuality — were not welcome.

Ramin Haderi, who is 25 years old, is an engineer and earns about $600 a month. He said he believes that people from other countries will come and spend money in Iran.


"Yes, we made the nuclear deal, but that's it," said Abbas Khorramabadi, 44, a civil servant eagerly participating in a "morals" march after the fiery sermon. "We will not allow for any other compromises. ... No Western values shall prevail."
Sam Madikians, who owns the Naderi restaurant, said that people are beginning to have hope.


Obama has repeatedly signaled his willingness for direct contact, both in remarks and in a recent exchange of letters with Rouhani, who was elected in June after a campaign that included pledges to ease [Iran's](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) isolation and improve relations with the West.

The White House says President Barack Obama and Rouhani are not scheduled to meet. But U.S. officials have hinted that Obama and other top officials are ready to chat with Rouhani. They could try to find a way to start bargaining about Iran's nuclear program.


Not necessarily so, says Qumars Hojjaty of Studio City, publisher of Pars Times, a web site focused on Southern California's large Iranian community.

"It's the biggest stage and the best players (are) playing there," says Beitashour, a former Major League Soccer (MLS) all-star. He now plays right back for the Vancouver Whitecaps. "Having an opportunity to potentially be there, it's just great."


So even though Iranian coaches first contacted him three years ago and asked him to begin the lengthy process of preparing the paperwork necessary to visit the country, playing for them wasn't part of the plan — especially after being called into the U.S. national team camp in the summer of 2012 and again the following January.

But Beitashour didn't get into a game, and officials with U.S. Soccer said that it was unlikely he'd ever play for the team.


So when Iran called back, he jumped at the chance to play in a World Cup — and U.S. Coach Juergen Klinsmann blessed the decision as well.

"In our ranking in the right back position, he was five, six, seven. So it was not realistic," says Klinsmann, who played in three World Cups for Germany. "I don't want them to miss out on anything. If this is what they badly want, then absolutely fine."


TEHRAN, Iran — As world powers in Geneva negotiated the future of Iran's nuclear development program, Islamist hard-liners here continued to warn of a deceitful, perfidious West scheming to enfeeble the Islamic Republic.

TEHRAN, Iran — Iran and the United States haven't been talking since 1979. That's when the Islamic Revolution in Iran took place. They threw out their Shah, who had been supported by the U.S. Young Iranians took over the U.S. Embassy for a year.


Many young Iranians gravitate to the snug coffeehouses that have sprung up in recent years and wouldn't be out of place in London, New York or Los Angeles. The venues are occasionally subject to crackdowns from the nation's so-called morality police, who appear to view the caffeine-driven gathering spots, though legal, as vaguely seditious in a culture where tea remains the preferred beverage and men and women are not supposed to mingle together in public.

"In art, in fashion, in cinema and in our daily lifestyle, we copycat American culture," said Sarah. She owns a cafe in Tehran. "There is a big difference between the approved culture and the reality of urban lifestyles in big cities like Tehran."


"It was a blunder that my father's generation committed," said Amirali, 26, another cafe patron. "Why should we suffer for their mistake?"

"I wear jeans and I eat fake American fast food," said Sasan, 26. He was sitting in a cafe near Revolution Square. "The Islamic revolutionary culture has not influenced our tastes. In fact, our parents' generation has failed to instill revolutionary values to us."


"Years of our hard work go to waste," lamented Fayzy, an alumna of the school. "The school needs talented children who stay the course."

## "Everyone Says It Is Haram"


"The future of ballet in Iraq is dismal. No one really cares," said Salam, 18, a lanky brunette with a dreamy voice. She now teaches children while pursuing her own dance career, hoping to perform solo.

"Years of our hard work go to waste," said Fayzy, who graduated from the school.


Khalid, the 12-year-old, says the moral questions surrounding dance don't dent her enthusiasm.

Leezan Salam, who graduated this year, said that when she started ballet at the school, there were around 30 girls with her. By the time she reached the 10th grade, "we were only three."


Dance can be equally problematic for boys.

"Everyone says it is haram (religiously prohibited) and disgraceful. But my parents are happy for me to dance," she said.


Mosul, the biggest city in the Islamic State group's self-declared caliphate, boasts a relatively educated, diverse population that seeks to preserve its heritage sites and libraries. In the chaos that followed the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein, residents near the Central Library hid some of its centuries-old manuscripts in their own homes to prevent their theft or destruction by looters.

The books attack God and "call for disobeying Allah," an Islamic State official declared during the raid. "So they will be burned." The books were stuffed into empty flour bags and taken away.


A University of Mosul history professor, who spoke on condition he not be named because of his fear of the Islamic State group, said the extremists started wrecking the collections of other public libraries last month. He reported particularly heavy damage to the archives of a Sunni Muslim library, the library of the 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers and the Mosul Museum Library with works dating back to 5000 BC.

## Different Century, Same Hate


The professor said Islamic State group militants appeared determined to "change the face of this city ... by erasing its iconic buildings and history."

Hakim al-Zamili is an Iraqi lawmaker. He said the Islamic State group is just like the raiding Mongols who attacked Baghdad in 1258. Back then, the Mongols dumped many ancient books into the Tigris River. It is said that the waters turned black from running ink.

At least part of the scenario is real. In October, Navy SEALs raided a compound along the coast of Somalia on a mission to capture a leader of the terrorist group al-Shabab. But they were forced to retreat to their boats and abandon the mission when they came under heavy gunfire.

Suddenly the soldier smashes through the door. He stands menacingly as dozens of rounds bounce harmlessly off his suit and helmet.

Without U.S. participation, the prospects for a successful conventional campaign against ISIS are slim.

At this point, the United States should not try to solve Syria. As long as Russia and Iran help Assad, he will stick around. Then the war will continue. Groups like ISIS and others will keep fighting him. Moreover, the U.S. just cannot lead in the fight to get the Islamic State everywhere.

In the Independence School District, some staff members are learning other strategies for stopping students before they lose control, including staying calm themselves and recognizing cues that a situation is escalating.

Knudtson's son goes to Mill Creek Elementary in Missouri. The isolation room at his school is an empty room. It has a door that leads into the room. The district says a student can never be locked inside.  


Administrators of the Christian schools, which mainly cater to Christian and Muslim Arabs, accuse Israel of pressuring them to join the public school system -- a move they say would compromise the schools' Christian values and undermine their high academic achievements.

The students all attend Christian schools, which are closed to protest a government decision to give the schools less money. Critics say Israel is treating the schools unfairly.


Wadie Abu Nasser, an adviser to the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, said negotiations are "not easy" but didn't want to elaborate so as not to compromise the outcome. He said the talks are being conducted in a "positive atmosphere" and hopes they will result in a "just and dignified solution."

Khader Khoury is the Khoury children's father. He said that racism is coming from the government, not the Israeli people. He said the Israeli government is treating the Jewish majority and the Arab minority differently. "This is clear, there isn't any other explanation," Khoury said.


But in recent weeks, some local and international human rights groups have been calling on Israel to do more as reports emerged that a 17-year-old girl was returned to Syria after Israeli courts rejected an asylum petition she filed asking to be transferred to relatives in a third country.

The 9-year-old boy is one of 17 Syrians being treated at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, a mountain outpost in northern Israel. Safed is about 5 miles west of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It is roughly 25 miles west of the Syrian war zone.


Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, said that his government has provided some assistance to Jordanian refugee camps but that wider efforts have been hampered by the "sheer hostility toward Israel" across the region. He said Israel is treating Syrians because it's the right thing to do, and that those treated aren't seeking asylum and want to go home.

Fares, who is 36, asked to be identified by only his first name, as he fears he might attract hostility for treating Syrians. He was in the emergency room when the 9-year-old, a skinny kid with long eyelashes, was brought in. The boy cried for two days straight.


On a recent afternoon, the pair sat together on the floor of the crowded ward for wounded children. Fares played along as the boy and one of his cousins, who also lost a leg in the bomb attack, threw a red plastic ball repeatedly against his head. The kids hung on him as he talked, grabbing at his big hands and picking at the dried gel in his hair.

Explosions can be heard and clouds of smoke seen from the top of Bental Mountain in the Heights.


"It makes me feel not strong or not free," he said of the conflict and living in the West Bank. "But here I can see Israeli kids and talk to them and send them my message. I can tell them what I can't tell them back in the West Bank."

Shachar is an Israeli teen from Jerusalem. He'd never before spoken to a Palestinian, although they are neighbors.


"It's really impossible for them to meet in this format back in their home territory," Kanak said. "There's a separation wall, so there's certainly physical and geographic barriers, but there are national barriers as well."

"Here I can see Israeli kids and talk to them and send them my message," Taher said. "I can tell them what I can't tell them back in the West Bank."


"We were all really concerned," Gordon said. "We were wondering if there was going to be any problems with the young people being able to get out here, but everything has gone well so far."

"It's really impossible for them to meet ... back in their home territory," Kanak said. Kanak spoke of the wall that stands between Israel and the Palestinian areas. The two peoples are separated in other ways. Israelis and Palestinians live in different cities. Their children go to different schools. There are very few places Israelis and Palestinians can even meet.


"The Israeli Football Association has tried to cover its ugly face with plastic surgery for its government," he said.

## "The Power To Connect People"


Kemer said the Palestinians were mixing politics and soccer and argued that his association had taken measures to support Palestinian soccer and fight racism. But security restrictions by the Israeli authorities were out of its control, he said.

Palestinian Football Association chief Jibril Rajoub said he had no plans to back down. Rajoub said he believed there were enough votes from FIFA members to pass the resolution suspending Israel.


"These are questions of political science university students, not children returning from summer vacation," he told Israeli news media.

## Tough Questions From Youngest Children


In a series of interviews over the weekend, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the challenge of balancing the country's ever-growing defense needs with maintaining an overall strong economy and solid government services. However, he said, "security must come first."

Shay Piron is the head of the Education Ministry. He insisted the cuts would not harm key school programs or shorten the school day.


Environment Minister Amir Peretz, who voted against the cut, said it would hit weaker Israelis "directly in the pocket." While it is true that the government promised to refrain from new taxes, he said, it should acknowledge that an unexpected event had taken place and "have enough courage to impose a temporary tax that would spread the burden more equally."
Parents will feel the effect of the cuts, said Sophie Hod. She is a policewoman and mother of two. Hod said parents had been told that school costs would go up. "I suppose there's not much choice," Hod added. She said that tourism, business and most other areas were also suffering.

In response, the school is building up its own revenue-generating businesses, including a recently launched "Alpha Wear" clothing line and an Internet radio station that draws 60,000 people monthly by broadcasting tunes featuring alumni. School director Sister Susan Frazer said the online radio program isn't bringing in revenue yet, but is expected to eventually raise money through sponsorship and advertising.

Now the school is being squeezed. Rising costs and shrinking state support make it difficult to run. The money crunch has gotten so bad that the nuns say they will have to stop letting students live at the school later this year. Alpha's place in Jamaican music may not matter.


Alpha's music program dates back to 1892, when boys participated in a drum and fife corps. The outfit evolved into a famed brass band under the school's longtime matriarch, Sister Mary Ignatius Davies, an avid record collector who encouraged students' musical talents for decades before her death in 2003 at age 81.

## Upbeat Ska And Rocksteady


While the individuals buried at Jamestown were not royalty, they were considered pivotal figures in the early colony. Horn compared the find to the 2012 discovery of the lost grave of King Richard III in England.

## A Box Of Catholic Relics


Mysteriously, a small silver box resting atop Archer's coffin turns out likely to be a Catholic reliquary containing bone fragments and a container for holy water. Archer's parents were Catholic in Protestant England, which became illegal. So the discovery raises the question of whether Archer was perhaps part of a secret Catholic cell — or even a Catholic spy on behalf of the Spanish, Horn said.

## Lots Of Schools, Few Students


Oysters, scallops, mussels and sea squirts thrive here in Ogatsu Bay, which bends like a crooked finger more than a mile inland from Japan's northeastern coast. Ito's father plied this inlet, and his grandfather too. Four years ago, Ogatsu had 300 such salty dogs among its population of 4,300.

## Earthquake, Tsunami Wrecked Town


But officially, about 220,000 people are still classified as displaced or evacuated and have yet to return to permanent homes. The recovery rate for the fishery and food processing industry lags behind those of all other sectors, according to Japan's Reconstruction Agency.

In the years since the storm, Ogatsu has been recovering. Wreckage has been cleared. Roads, schools and hospitals have been rebuilt.


But other things changed for the better.

## Can Oysters Save Ogatsu?


By paying fishermen double or even triple the rate they'd get selling to middlemen, Ito's outfit, Kai-you, has attracted a network of willing suppliers, sometimes taking in 2 tons of seafood a day. Kai-you handles the cleaning and distribution, selling directly to 350 restaurants across Japan (while paying the fishery association a small fee to not make waves).

"I bought this for my parents, but even they don't want to live here," he says.


Nevertheless, in November, Ito cinched the final link in his chain. With a $350,000 bank loan, he opened Ostra de Ole, a 32-seat oyster bar on a busy corner in Sendai. (Ito, who has a penchant for bilingual wordplay, explains that the Spanish name also conveys the idea of "My Oysters" in Japanese.)

While driving out of the town of Ogatsu, Ito points to a large empty area of land.


One recent Saturday night, Ito traded his rubber waders for a crisp white shirt and a dapper black vest. Patches of gray poked through his black mane. He roamed the restaurant, greeting customers and keeping an eye on his waitstaff. "Try this yume-gaki," he encourages one diner, explaining that they take four years to grow so large. "It was born in the spring of the tsunami."

"Before, this was a town," he says. "Now, I don't know what to call it."

Collins decided to come out because of a noticeable shift in public opinion toward tolerance among Americans, he wrote in his essay.

"This is no exaggeration: Fully one third of suicides among teenagers occur because of their sexuality," she wrote. She told NPR that she received letters herself from people who were ready to commit suicide out of despair about feeling alone until they saw her or read about her.

If you aren't experiencing bullying right now, become an advocate for people around you who might be singled out because they don't look or act like everyone else. Speak up for the people around you who are being bullied, or help them find someone like a mentor or teacher who they can confide in. 

When you get bullied, you might want to become like everyone. Do not do it. Hold on to what makes you special. It might be what makes you an artist or a scientist some day. You can help others who feel the same way you do. You would be surprised how many people you admire now were once bullied for being different.


William Thorpe says the town of Jim Thorpe has done a wonderful job caring for his father's grave.

Of course, it's still early days. Organizers can't let down their guard.

However, epidemiological studies on juice consumption show correlations, not cause and effect, said Elizabeth Ward, a registered dietitian on Jamba Juice's Healthy Living Council.

Native American groups have vehemently protested Serra's road to sainthood, saying that the natives who built the missions in the 1700s and 1800s were forced into labor and often punished severely. Many died of European diseases, including chicken pox and measles, because they had built up no immunities.

## A Good Example


"You can't change the past, and we all acknowledge mistakes were made in the past," Galvan said. "The bottom line is I believe Junipero Serra was a very good person in a very bad situation, which I call colonialism."

Valentin Lopez is a Native American activist who is disappointed by the pope's decision. Lopez hopes the Catholic Church will reconsider Serra's sainthood.


"Thirty years ago, the lines were really tightly drawn between people who supported Serra's beatification and people who didn't. It was very intense," said Senkewicz, who co-authored the forthcoming biography "Junipero Serra: California, Indians and the Transformation of a Missionary."

Elias Castillo recently wrote a book called "A Cross of Thorns: The Enslavement of California's Indians by the Spanish Missions."


So what will be Serra's legacy? Will he be known for the treatment of Native Americans or for his role as a Catholic missionary spreading the gospel in a new land?

He said the general opinion of Serra as a great man is a "horrible lie." Statues of Serra stand at all of California's 21 missions and at the state Capitol building.


"St. Francis of Assisi was known for nature. St. Thomas Aquinas for intellectual scholarship. Mother Seton in the U.S. is known for devotion to the poor," Senkewicz said. "The niche of Serra is giving up a very, very prosperous life in Spain for a difficult missionary life."

"I'm astounded. I couldn't believe the pope was doing this," Castillo said. He thinks there will be protests by Native Americans.


Canonizing Serra also raises another question: Will he be considered California's first saint or even an American saint?

The Catholic Church has apologized for how Indians were treated, Castillo said, calling Serra "one of their great monsters."


"The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation was met with initial skepticism but has resulted in tangible progress in reducing calories in the marketplace," Yach said. The independent evaluations "represents a new way of ensuring that private-public partnerships have the impact they often claim."

Obama "focused on kids and kids eating healthy. She brought a lot of attention to it," Popkin said.


A new study, however, suggests that without Jupiter, Earth itself might not exist either. Where this and the other rocky planets now orbit there may have first been a previous generation of worlds destined to be bigger, gas-shrouded, utterly uninhabitable orbs. But Jupiter came swinging in, clearing the way for small worlds like Earth by destroying those older planets. The study, co-authored by California Institute of Technology planetary scientist Konstantin Batygin and University of California, Santa Cruz, astrophysicist Greg Laughlin, appeared in the March 23 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

## Jupiter Crashes The Solar System Party


Astronomers used to consider planetary systems reasonably static and stable. Planets would coalesce out of the swirling disks of gas and dust around young stars, a bit like trees springing up from dirt, putting down roots and scarcely budging from where they were born. Small, rocky planets would form in the intense light and heat close to stars, whereas gas-giant planets would form farther out, where cold temperatures preserved more gassy feedstock. Small or large, gassy or rocky, most planets would move about their stars in pristine, near-circular orbits. All this cohered with our understanding of our own solar system. But we may have been wildly mistaken about what is the norm.

## Restless Orbiters


Twenty years ago when astronomers found the first planets orbiting other stars, they also began realizing that planetary systems are chaotic places. Some planets did not orbit in near-circles but in oblong "eccentric" paths that took them swinging close and then far from their stars — almost as if they had been thrown off-kilter by the gravitational influence of other worlds. And most of the newfound giant planets were very different than Jupiter — in scorching, star-hugging orbits far inward from the cold outer regions where they must have formed. Planets could migrate, too, propelled by gentle interactions with their formative disks or by close encounters with their planetary siblings.

Scientists believe planets form from the gas and dust spinning around young stars. Scientists used to think planets stayed in the same place where they formed and did not change. Small, rocky planets would form close to the sun. Large, cold planets with atmospheres made of gases, called gas giants, would form away from the sun.


Ever since those discoveries researchers have been grappling with the idea of planetary migration to better understand not only the features of other planetary systems, but our own. One example is the "grand tack" scenario, which posits that in the first few million years of our solar system's existence Jupiter migrated into and then back out of the inner solar system, following a course similar to a sailboat's when it tacks around a buoy. Back then, Jupiter would still have been embedded in a gas-rich disk. Much of that gas was spiraling down toward the sun — so much that the action would have sapped some of Jupiter's angular momentum, too, causing the giant planet itself to spiral in to the vicinity of where Mars is today. Jupiter would have kept falling in toward the sun if not for being caught by the subsequent formation of Saturn, which began drifting in as well. As the two giant planets came closer together, they were caught  in an orbital resonance. This resonance expelled all the gas between them, gradually reversing their death spirals and causing them to "tack" back out to the outer solar system.

Scientists thought all planets stayed in the same orbit around the sun after they formed. It all matched up with what we knew about the solar system, but it could be wrong.


Like many subjects that touch on race and crime, "disproportionate minority contact" among both adults and kids in the justice system is an "uncomfortable topic," said Smith, the head of the Juvenile Department. "Does that mean we ignore it?"

"I actually laughed," Love said.


"There has been some implicit biases and decisions made at arrest, at incarceration, at adjudication, at all levels that … results in these young people being in the situation they are in," said Darlene Byrne, a state district judge in Travis County who is president-elect of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.

## Bad Habits Can Be Unlearned


Piquero said it's hard to know why minorities are overrepresented compared with whites. Many decisions are not documented and are not quantifiable because they involve discretion — like police officers' interactions with juveniles. It's possible, he said, that minorities are committing worse or more crimes in some instances. Or perhaps not.

Ashford said the program can help kids who have developed bad habits and have made bad decisions to turn their lives around.


LOS ANGELES — Eminem's "The Monster" ricocheted off the cinder-block walls and worn linoleum floor at Sylmar's Juvenile Hall.

LOS ANGELES — Scott Budnick is a movie producer. He spends most of his time organizing Hollywood movie projects. A jail for teens is not where you would expect to find him.


But Budnick, 38, began to feel empty.

"I'll be stressed out — I'll write about it," Antonio said.


Through a friend, he heard about InsideOut Writers, a volunteer creative-writing program in the county's juvenile halls. He attended a class in 2003 and was hooked by the young men, their backgrounds and their stories.

He explained that caring for the plants in their garden might help youths behind bars. Taking care of someone or something can help people learn how to be nicer to others.


His fishing partner, Lowell Aberson, a Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism's fisheries biologist for the lake, said its bass-fishing future may be looking better than it has in decades.

"These fish are so fat, their mouths always look small," said Joey Yeager, who has fished the area for many years. "I don't think I've ever seen a skinny bass in this lake."

"This lifestyle is the opposite of prosperity," said operations manager Cole.

"Hyah! Hep, hep! Tsssh!"


Jade Cole, 16, rose at 3:30 this morning to meet her uncle Cliff, the operations' manager, at the edge of a dark dirt road. Sleeping truckers are parked nearby.

"Epp! Epp!"

Gilmore did not give a specific answer on what penalty beneficiaries would face if they tried to spend their money at a restricted business such as a tattoo parlor. She said this would constitute a policy violation but not benefits fraud.

When asked whether he thought poor people could not be trusted to spend their welfare money responsibly, Couture-Lovelady responded, "Most can. Absolutely most can."


"Just because most people don't commit murder doesn't mean we shouldn't keep it illegal," he said. "The key point is that it hurts the folks who are using the program in the correct manner when the money is spent in these incorrect manners."

Shannon Cotsoradis is president of the group Kansas Action for Children. She said the new law is bad for mothers and young children. It requires a woman receiving welfare to return to work shortly after having a baby.

"Then they discovered girls and got married," she said. "But I was hooked."

Dugan still struggles with "face blindness." This condition makes it difficult, if not impossible, to recognize faces, even of friends and family.


"It takes me really a long time to learn something," she said. "And if I don't use it, I lose it."

"When you see a child get their first belt?" Dugan said. "When you see them get their first trophy? Remember, these are kids who don't get awards. They don't get trophies, and when you see the expression on their face when they get their first trophy, it's such a self-esteem builder."


She adopted unorthodox study techniques that jibed with the way her brain liked to learn.

"Put me with the kids," she said. "They keep you young."

"For nearly 20 years, since Kennewick Man turned up, I've been wondering why these early people looked so different from Native Americans," Chatters said. "This is one step toward resolving that issue."

Genetic tests show a clear link between the girl in the cave and modern Native Americans.


The study supports the traditional view that most of the people who colonized the Americas had their roots in northeast Asia, whether they came via a Bering land bridge or by sea, said University of New Mexico anthropologist James Dixon, who was not involved in the project.

The study is the first to make that link. It proves there is at least one Paleo-American — Naia —  who is descended from the same ancestors as modern Native Americans, said anthropologist Brian Kemp.


It's hard to draw sweeping conclusions from a single skeleton, cautioned Smithsonian Institution archaeologist Dennis Stanford. Based on similarities between spear points and stone tools, Stanford is convinced that some of the first people to settle North America came from Europe — and there's nothing in the new study to rule that out, he said.

The study supports the traditional view. Naia will help scientists argue that most of the people who colonized the Americas had their roots in northeast Asia, said anthropologist James Dixon.


Part of the skeleton was removed to a museum for safe keeping in March, after unauthorized divers moved the skull and broke several bones.

Naia's tooth was shipped to Kemp's lab at WSU to get the DNA. He didn't think it was going to work because the it was in such bad shape — but he was wrong.


At least 39 people were killed and 150 wounded Saturday in Kenya's worst terrorist attack in 15 years, said President Uhuru Kenyatta. The Shabab, a Somali group linked with al-Qaida, claimed responsibility, saying the attack was retribution for the country's invasion of its northern neighbor two years ago, aimed at controlling the Islamic militants.

At least 68 people were killed and 175 wounded Saturday at the mall shooting. It was Kenya's worst terror attack in 15 years, said President Uhuru Kenyatta. A group from Somalia claimed responsibility. It is called the Shabab. The group said the attack was payback.


Military and police helicopters flew over the shopping mall as ambulances rushed victims to nearby hospitals. The Kenyan army and special forces were called in to reinforce police. Kenya's Citizen TV aired footage of victims arriving by ambulance at hospitals, including some who had been shot in the head and others covered in blood but walking.

Kenyatta's own nephew was killed, as was his nephew's fiancee.


"We've been able to open the bottleneck to access the mother lode and deliver to you more than 20 times as many planets as have ever been found and announced at once," said Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center who co-led one of two papers on the discovery published in the Astrophysical Journal.

When planets are found too close to their star it's too hot for life to exist. Too far away and conditions are too cold for life. The planets are in a region where temperatures make liquid water — necessary for life as we know it — able to exist.


Two teams of researchers were able to devise a probability-based method that focused on these multi-planet systems, making the largest single exoplanet haul since the first one was discovered in the 1990s. It nearly quadruples the number of confirmed planets found with Kepler (from 246 to 961) and doubles the overall number of confirmed planets to about 1,700. (Many exoplanets have also been discovered using another technique called the radial velocity method, which looks for the gravitational influence of a planet on its star.)

The Kepler mission has found 3,601 possible planets. Only 246 had been previously confirmed. It takes a lot of extra work to ensure that the dips in light that Kepler picks up really are from a planet. Instead, Kepler might be picking up drops in light caused by two stars blocking each other.


The Islamic State group and other extremist organizations "have made it abundantly clear that they will use the refugee crisis to try to enter the United States. Now the Obama administration wants to bring in an additional 10,000 Syrians without a concrete and foolproof plan to ensure that terrorists won't be able to enter the country," said U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and U.S. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.

"We're doing what we know we can manage immediately," he said.


"Obama today demonstrated that he cares more about kowtowing to green-collar elitists than he does about creating desperately needed, family-supporting, blue-collar jobs," Terry O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, said in a statement.

Congressman Kevin McCarthy said the president's decision shows he is not a strong enough leader. Obama is not able to handle tough problems, he said.


"Our findings suggest that the location where foods are obtained may not be as important as the nutritional quality of the foods consumed," the authors wrote in Thursday's study. They also suggest that "the effect of public health efforts targeted at fast food restaurants may also be overestimated, such that these efforts may be necessary but not sufficient to reduce child obesity if the remainder of the diet is not addressed."

The result: Those who followed the Western diet when they were not eating at fast-food restaurants had the highest rates of being overweight or obese. This was true even for those who were in the group of non-eaters of fast food. Those who followed a "prudent diet" when not eating fast food were much less likely to be overweight or obese. This was the case even for those who were in the "high" group of fast food eaters.


Previous studies have found that a distaste for disadvantageous inequity develops in children by the time they are 4\. Advantageous inequity aversion, on the other hand, doesn't appear until closer to 8\. That seems to indicate the influence of social norms.

On a gloomy day last month, the students clustered around a folding table in the KnitLAB to create fiber scarves. The room at the foundation is small, and boxes of donated yarn in a rainbow of colors crowd a massive bookshelf. Knitting needles are stuffed haphazardly in vases and cups.

## Dropping A "Knit Bomb"


Spencer said many of the students initially felt as though knitting was only for old people, a notion she quickly dispelled.

"I thought this would probably be boring at first," Akenna said. "You think of a grandma sitting in her front room knitting with all her cats."


"There's so much beauty in the pain of this thing," Bryant said. "It sounds really weird to say that, but I appreciate the really, really tough times as much as I appreciate the great times. It's important to go through that progression, because I think that's where you really learn about the self."

Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak was not surprised that Bryant decided to retire. The team is not doing well and is no longer a challenge for him, Kupchak said. "I think the game will be easier for him now," Kupchak said. "I think he'll be able to enjoy the rest of the season."


She attributed the dip in overall foreign language studies to campus budget cutbacks and the pressure students feel to focus on career-oriented classes, such as science and business, at the expense of humanities. That decline has occurred, Feal said, even though "knowledge of a second language often is helpful in many positions and translates into increased salary."

According to a recent national study, the number of college students taking Korean classes is soaring. The Modern Language Association reported that students in Korean language classes rose 45 percent from 2009 to 2013. Overall, language studies declined 6.7 percent. Interest has dropped for many popular foreign languages, including Spanish, French and German.


At UCLA, enrollment is up significantly in both in the beginners' courses and in the so-called heritage classes tailored to Korean-Americans who have some knowledge of the language but often don't have the grammar skills. Professors report waiting lists at the start of the quarters for the classes. (Most UCLA undergraduates must fulfill a graduation requirement for a year of language study or test out of it.)

She said that students take fewer foreign language classes because colleges lack the money to offer them. Also, students feel pressure to focus on classes that will help them get jobs later on. They take science and business classes, for instance, instead of history. Speaking a second language is important, Feal said. People who know foreign languages, for instance, can earn more money.


Among the exercises were sentences with connective contrasts, which instructor Jae Eun Im wrote on the board and had the class repeat aloud.

## Learning The Alphabet


Although it's still hard for her to read Korean lyrics fast enough, a more important lesson was reinforced: learning another language, she said, "breaks down barriers between people and teaches them to look beyond surface level."
## Singing K-Wave Songs


A 2012 meta-analysis of studies co-authored by Nigg concluded that color additives have an effect on hyperactive behavior in children, with a small subset showing more extreme behavior than others. He also concluded that further research was needed because so many of the studies looked at only small numbers of people or could not draw conclusions about the general population. Studies have also shown removing foods containing artificial dyes via restriction diets can successfully decrease hyperactivity but Nigg says this is likely because removing processed foods in general is healthier and results in better behavioral outcomes for children with ADHD.

But Joel Nigg, a professor at Oregon Health &amp; Science University, disagrees. He says the studies support the link between dyes and hyperactivity. "On the one hand you can sympathize with those who want to take a wait-and-see attitude," he says. But, he adds, "Do you want to take a chance that these initial studies are wrong and put kids at risk?"


These cities all have an extra threat from potential earthquakes because of the amplified shaking, said Greg Beroza, a geophysics professor at Stanford and the study's senior author. The research group plans to test the virtual earthquake technique in other parts of Southern California and in other cities around the world, he said.

Denolle said the effect can be compared to shaking a bathtub with water in it. In this case, the water represents the soft ground. The tub represents the solid rocks around it. If you shake the tub, she said, the bathtub itself will not shake much, but the water will. So would anything on top of it.


"We live in earthquake country in Southern California," Graves said. "It's virtually certain that we will have a damaging earthquake in the future. … The study is useful because you can use that to help guide your preparedness and to help guide building codes or engineering designs, particularly for large-scale projects."
The virtual earthquake technique was developed as a way to test computer models of Southern California earthquakes, Beroza said. And indeed, the virtual earthquakes confirmed the results from computer models. They showed that L.A. will shake more strongly than areas close by.


LOS ANGELES — E-cigarettes have been billed as a safer alternative to cancer-causing tobacco products that can wean heavy smokers off their habit.

LOS ANGELES — If you can't smoke a cigarette where you're standing, you can't smoke an e-cigarette either. On Tuesday, Los Angeles joined a growing list of cities to treat e-cigarettes the same as regular cigarettes. It will ban their use in parks, restaurants and most workplaces.


"We have a right to … choose to breathe clean air," Councilwoman Nury Martinez told her colleagues. "And if this device turns out to be safe, then we can always undo the ordinance. But if this device proves not to be safe, we cannot undo the harm this will create on the public health."

Dr. Jonathan Fielding runs the Los Angeles Department of Public of Health. He said the growing comfort with e-cigarettes is a threat. It could undo years of public education efforts about the dangers of smoking.


Tuesday's City Hall debate quickly turned personal. Councilman Mitch O'Farrell, who pushed for the new restrictions, recalled his days breathing secondhand smoke as a waiter in a downtown restaurant. Martinez, who sided with O'Farrell, described her husband's unsuccessful battle to quit smoking.

Calling himself "the council's No. 1 smoker," Wesson said he took up the habit as a 20-year-old factory worker because he wanted to be "cool."


LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday backed a plan to raise the city's minimum wage to $15 per hour, joining a trend sweeping cities across the country as elected leaders seek to boost stagnating pay for workers on the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder.

LOS ANGELES — Minimum wage is the least amount of money a boss is allowed to pay his or her workers. The amount is different in some areas of the country. In Los Angeles, the minimum wage is $9 an hour.


"Without a doubt, it was a very big victory," said Durazo, now with Unite Here, the hotel and restaurant workers' union.

"Make no mistake," said Councilman Paul Krekorian. "Today the city of Los Angeles, the second-biggest city in the nation, is leading the nation."


"The very people (council members') rhetoric claims to help with this action, it's going to hurt," said Ruben Gonzalez, the L.A. Chamber of Commerce's senior vice president for public policy and political affairs.

"Without a doubt, it was a very big victory," said Durazo.


"The very last thing that we should be doing as a city is creating a competitive disadvantage for our businesses with those in neighboring cities," said Englander, who represents the northwest San Fernando Valley.

"It's simple math," Gonzalez said. Businesses will not be able to pay workers that much more money in such a short time.


Garcetti said Los Angeles, home to the Olympics in 1932 and 1984, would stage games that are both spectacular and profitable. He was given unanimous approval from his city council to strike agreements for a 2024 bid, a move that was immediately followed by the U.S. Olympic Committee naming Los Angeles as its candidate.

Cities have already been selected for the next four Olympics. None of them are in the United States.


A so-called host city contract, which essentially sticks the city and state — not the IOC — with the burden of any cost overruns, became an obstacle in Boston, which was dropped from contention in late July amid shaky public support and questions about taxpayer spending and liability.

## L.A. Leaders Say City Will Do A Great Job


"We are in this to win it, and I think we will," said Councilman Paul Krekorian. "We can't do that at the risk of exposure to our taxpayers."

Los Angeles was made for this, Mayor Eric Garcetti said. "This city is the world's greatest stage," he added.


HOUSTON — A 21-year odyssey came to an end Tuesday when National Football League owners voted to allow the St. Louis Rams to move to Los Angeles for the 2016 season and gave the San Diego Chargers an option to join the Rams in Inglewood.

HOUSTON, Texas — Los Angeles, California, has not had a football team for 21 years. During that time many have tried to bring football back again. One plan after another has failed. 


NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell then met with Raiders owner Mark Davis and Chargers counterpart Dean Spanos along with the L.A. relocation committee. Goodell then presented the options to the full membership minus the Oakland, San Diego and St. Louis owners before taking the final vote.

## A Shared Stadium


The design calls for a roof with metal borders and an area over the playing field made of a transparent material called ETFE, which is as clear as a car windshield yet strong enough to support the weight of a vehicle. The stadium would be open on the sides, allowing breezes to flow through the building and enhance the outdoor feel.

Before now, Spanos has supported the Carson plan. For almost a year, the two men did not want to work together.


There were multiple plans for stadiums in downtown L.A. — the Anschutz Entertainment Group abandoned its proposal in March — as well as fleeting visions in Anaheim, Industry, Irvine and several attempts to remake the Coliseum while preserving its historic character.

Right now, there is only one shared stadium in the NFL. It is located in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The stadium is shared by the New York Giants and Jets football teams.


While L.A. sat vacant, three-quarters of the league's teams got new or significantly renovated stadiums. The threat of moving to L.A. — however subtle — became leverage for the NFL. More than half the league's 32 teams were linked to Los Angeles either overtly or by rumor over two decades.

Four mayors tried to bring football back, all with no luck. There were plans from rich businessmen. Even stars like Garth Brooks, Tom Cruise and Magic Johnson tried to help out. Before Tuesday, every plan fizzled out.


British authorities have invested nearly 4 million pounds ($6.7 million) in the plan to stimulate research in the London-Oxford-Cambridge area. It aims to attract companies to the area to foster collaboration and promote research and manufacturing. A major center for biological research will open in London next year.

## Recipe For A Nose


As iconic as palm trees, LAPD helicopters — "ghetto birds" in some quarters — have played a "good cop-bad cop" role in popular culture for decades. The benign "whirlybirds" that flew out of a San Fernando Valley airport on crime-solving missions in the 1950s TV series of that name became ominous "helicopter gunships" in dystopian author Mike Davis' "City of Quartz," and omnipresent LAPD "spinners" in Ridley Scott's "Blade Runner."

## Flights Rise, Crimes Drop


"It's extremely cutting edge," says Capt. Gary Walters, who heads the LAPD's air support unit. "It's different. It's nothing that we've ever done before with this specificity."

Craig Uchida looks at the LAPD's crime numbers and offers advice on preventing crime. He says it is too early to prove the link between the flights and crime. So far though, the results look good.


The most pronounced difference came last September. During the week of Sept. 13, when the helicopter unit flew over Newton 65 times, the division recorded 90 crimes. A week later, the number of flights dropped to 40 and the number of reported crimes skyrocketed to 136, with rises seen among almost all types of crime, including burglary, car theft and thefts from vehicles.

## Last Dance For Bad Guys


Peter Bibring, a senior staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, says using helicopters to monitor neighborhoods could set a problematic precedent for how the LAPD conducts other surveillance.

"That gets people pumped up to do something different," Malinowski says. He helped develop the new way to prevent crime. "It kind of injects life into the crime fighting."

According to district data from the 2013-14 school year, black students accounted for about 11 percent of Los Angeles' student population, but they made up about one-third of those suspended.

In 2013, the Los Angeles Unified School District stopped suspending students who disobeyed teachers. In 2012, students who skipped class no longer got tickets from the police. Instead, they received off-campus counseling.


The digital projector cost $80,000, what she paid for the place in 2004, but against her husband's advice, she borrowed the money this year and took the plunge. At the first showing, the boxy new machine malfunctioned, forcing her to tell 75 carloads of customers there would be no show that night.

## Won't Let It Flicker Out


Don't call him Ishmael. Call him Kingsley. Kingsley Stowe is among what could be the last in a long line of whalers from this tiny island.

But there have been few sightings of the humpback whales that migrate through the waters off the island. As yet, no whales have been captured.


It's whale-hunting season, and islanders are hungry for the savory meat they say tastes like beef, and the oil used in a variety of homemade remedies. But there have been only sparse sightings of the breaching humpbacks that routinely migrate south from their northern feeding grounds — and no captures.

"I don't think we're going to go out today," says whale hunter Kingsley Stowe. He is a proud defender of whale hunting, which is close to disappearing.


Whaling was once a big and profitable business in Bequia (pronounced BECK-way) supporting at least a dozen whale boats. But that was before quotas and broad bans on commercial whaling made this hilly outpost off St. Vincent in the Grenadines the only place in the Americas to still allow "Moby Dick" style harpooning.

## "Took My Breath Away"


"Whaling is a tradition around Bequia," he says. "We will continue to whale, and we'll continue the tradition."

Earlier this month, the International Court of Justice banned Japan from hunting whales in the Antarctic. Japan claims it kills the whales as part of scientific research.


Though it's old, it is not an indigenous or subsistence industry, said Louise Mitchell, chairwoman of the St. Vincent and the Grenadines National Trust, which has taken up the anti-whaling crusade.

## Whale Jawbones At Beach


"We're using cellphones to locate where the whales are, and we're using speedboats to go up to the whale and strike the whale," he says. "We are no longer involved in the indigenous craftsmanship of whale hunting 'Moby Dick' style."

"There are no whales here to watch," says Stowe, scanning the rough and empty sea. "You see any whales to watch?"


"Whaling did have its place in history and it was important; like in the time when we didn't have electricity. But we have moved beyond that," she says. "I do not support it at this time in our history because it is not meeting a subsistence need anymore."

"If we don't have whaling, what else is there to do?" he says. "As my son said the other day, the only whale I want to watch is the one on my plate."

He had to go to an Internet cafe a block from his home to hear the lectures by Agarwal, who is president of edX, a nonprofit consortium set up in 2012 by MIT and Harvard that has offered 72 courses online.

That was easy to see minutes after arriving at the family's apartment. There, the teenager showed off his workbench. On it were circuit boards he has been soldering, and his own designs for an unmanned helicopter.


"You look at another person's lecture and you think, 'Wow! That person has a really great technique or ideas. Can I emulate that?'" Fox said. "The other way is to say, 'Uh oh, I'm in trouble because the other teacher is making me look bad.'"

"Intelligence and ability are distributed equally around the globe," said Armando Fox, a computer scientist who is studying online courses. "It's in everyone's best interest to find and cultivate that talent."


"It comes at you faster. They tell you in 50 minutes while our own courses last 100 minutes," Martinez said.

Nahiely Mendoza, 24, graduated with a law degree in December. She said she grew excited after looking over the online listings.


"But sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can get lost in the passage of time," Obama told a group of about 60 that included family, military members and Medal of Honor recipients. "This medal is a reminder that no matter how long it takes, it is never too late to do the right thing."

## Never Gave Up


"He deserved it," Zerwekh said following the ceremony in the Roosevelt Room. "I didn't think it would ever happen, I really didn't."

"This is the classic example of how two individuals can make a difference — Alonzo Cushing and Margaret Zerwekh," said Congressman Ron Kind of Wisconsin. He attended the ceremony. Kind is the descendant of two brothers who fought during the Civil War.


Standing at a podium underneath a painting of a rough riding Teddy Roosevelt, Obama singled out Zerwekh for her efforts, which started in the early 1980s when she contacted then-U.S. Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin.

Receiving the Medal of Honor was Helen Loring Ensign, age 85, of Palm Springs, California. She is distant cousin of Cushing.


Obama noted "she even managed to bring Republicans and Democrats together to make this happen. Margaret, we may call on you again some time in the next several months."

## Died Next To His Cannon


"They say the wheels of democracy grind slowly, but 151 years slow?" said Kind, a descendant of two brothers who fought with the 7th Wisconsin during the Civil War. "This is the classic example of how two individuals can make a difference — Alonzo Cushing and Margaret Zerwekh."

"I remember being very, very proud to see a stone in his name. Gettysburg was a part of our family history," Ensign said.


It took the Army Past Conflict Repatriations Branch weeks to track down Cushing's family, following Obama's announcement of the honor in late August. Cushing died childless at the age of 22 and none of his brothers had children.

## "I'll Fight It Out"


Ensign has visited Gettysburg many times and stood at the spot where her ancestor fell next to his artillery gun. A spot now memorialized with a stone marker.

"He said 'No, I'll fight it out or die in the attempt,'" said Brown.


"I remember being very, very proud to see a stone in his name. Gettysburg was a part of our family history," Ensign said.

Paul C. Jussel is a military studies professor at the U.S. Army War College. He said the battle was the last great fight Confederate General Robert E. Lee made for the South. "Ultimately, it doesn't work and Cushing had a lot to do with that."


The growing clout of Latino consumers has also drawn attention, with businesses such as Target Corp. unveiling campaigns to attract them. Nationally, Latino purchasing power has increased from $700 billion in 2000 to $1.3 trillion in 2015, according to the Pew Hispanic Center.

And historically, the image of Latinos protesting is linked to immigration, not police brutality, said Amin David, 82, former president of a Latino civil rights group, Los Amigos of Orange County.

None of those deaths has been noticed much. There has been very little protest.


He said his 16-year-old daughter told him about the video of the Gardena shooting. "She told me, 'Dad, police shot another Latino,' " Viramontes recalled. "My wife told her, 'See, this is why you listen to the police.' "

"They (leaders) are fighting over who will rule the Banana Republic," Ashekman raps.

## "Create And Change Visual Scenery"


When the landfill closed July 17, Lebanon's notoriously gridlocked government again failed to take action, leaving piles of smoldering rubbish baking in the sun in the streets of Beirut and its suburbs.

The Lebanese government may not have much time. Two weeks ago, officials permanently closed Beirut's main garbage dump. The Naameh landfill near Beirut was supposed to close a year ago. It was kept open in hopes that the government would find an alternative. It did not.


It came amid the busiest time of year in Beirut. International stars such as singer Charles Aznavour, soprano Anna Netrebko and jazz musician Richard Bona are performing at Lebanon's famed summer festivals, and bars and beaches are at full capacity. Partygoers sidestep rotting garbage on the way to bars at Lebanon's famous Gemayzeh street.

When the landfill closed July 17, Lebanon's government again did nothing. Piles of garbage were left to bake in the summer sun.


Meanwhile, some people have taken to paying for private pickup truck owners to collect the garbage in front of their homes, who dump it at night in unknown locations. The country has long lacked recycling services or even basic trash sorting, exacerbating the problem.

For 10 days, garbage trucks could not collect the trash. They had nowhere to dump it because the main landfill was closed. The smell got so bad that some people wore masks to cover their mouths and noses. Piles of trash grew larger on streets, sidewalks and near building entrances.


Abi Rached said garbage is spreading to natural reserves, rivers and valleys and local leaders are resorting to tactics that were common during the 1975-90 civil war.

Lebanon's downtown center is full of historic buildings and expensive apartments. For now, its streets are clean of garbage. Officials have found a short-term solution. They are sending most of the trash to an empty lot and covering it with a plastic sheet.


"It's gotten to a point where people are digging up pits and burying the trash," he said.

Lebanon's garbage company is called Sukleen. It has started collecting some of the garbage. It took trash to two landfills. One of them is near Beirut International Airport. Those are filling up. Nearby cities have refused to accept Beirut's garbage.


He said he was sounding the alarm after random landfills have started to reach full capacity, including the dump site near Beirut's airport. That has drawn warnings from the public works minister, who said the trash poses air safety risks because of smoke and birds flying over the pit.

"It's gotten to a point where people are digging up pits and burying the trash," he said.


Last year, James - who donned a hoodie in honor of Trayvon Martin with Heat teammates in 2012 - said Rice's death showed "how much further we still have to go," according to Cleveland.com.

They have turned to the closest thing Ohio has to a superhero. They have asked Cleveland Cavaliers basketball star LeBron James to sit out the NBA season.


Pointing to the University of Missouri as an example presents problems as well. Football players, along with other students activists, were able to force the Wolfe's ouster because it hinged upon one man's decision instead of plodding investigation or a legal decision.
James has not responded to the request to not play.


Thirteen months after he departed the White House, Theodore Roosevelt marched into Paris and delivered a poignant, timeless speech that is still referenced today. Richard Nixon mentioned it when he both arrived and left office. Nelson Mandela once gave a copy to the captain of the South African rugby team and countless American athletes have acknowledged using it as inspiration before pivotal moments.

In July, basketball superstar LeBron James rejoined his home team.

At the same time, her great-grandmother sent Mikaila's family a 1940s cookbook, which included her special recipe for flaxseed lemonade.

First, she got stung by two bees in one week. "I hated the bees," Mikaila said.


"Mikaila took some license by adjusting the formula to make it her own," said her father, Theo, whose title at his daughter's company is "Chief Worker Bee." He added, "She used the original recipe as the basis for the lemonade."

JOHANNESBURG — Slightly more than 13 months since Liberia's first case of Ebola, the West African nation has been declared free of the deadly disease, 42 days after the burial of the last victim on March 28.

JOHANNESBURG — Liberia declared it was now free of Ebola, one year after the disease began spreading across West Africa.


"With infectious cases and corpses remaining in homes and communities, almost guaranteeing further infections, some expressed concern that the virus might become endemic in Liberia, adding another — and especially severe — permanent threat to health," the World Health Organization said in its statement.

Ending Ebola in Liberia was a huge achievement, the WHO said. Liberia's "determination to defeat Ebola never wavered, courage never faltered." Doctors and nurses continued to treat patients even when there were not enough gowns and masks to protect them from the disease.


Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said that for many in the country, it will take a generation for the pain and grief to heal. She referred to the slow response of the international community when she told The Associated Press that the epidemic was a "scar on the conscience of the world."

A U.S. government statement said the world must not let Ebola return to Liberia.


Morua's long wait for a computer offers a flip side to the current debate over how best to reinvent Miami-Dade's libraries. That discussion has largely focused on how to attract people with no current interest in libraries — entrepreneurs who need office space, twenty-somethings who might like a Starbucks near the checkout counter, and 3-D printers for the "maker" movement of techie do-it-yourselfers.

## Libraries Are Popular Places


The North Dade branch has the second-largest number of computers in the library system — 107, compared with 49 in South Dade — along with a pioneering national program for teens called YouMedia that pairs pricey computer equipment with creative endeavors.

Zach Leverenz runs EveryoneOn, which works with Miami-Dade to provide cheap Internet for students at home. He said that schools should not assume that students will find public Internet hotspots to do their homework.


"What the library can do for you is not bound by bricks and mortar," said Farrell, senior librarian at the Minneapolis Central Library. "This size of the unseen library is pretty immense."

Barbara Stripling is the president of the American Library Association. She said that most people would rather read the regular way, ink on paper.


Pope Francis, too, called for greater efforts. "I make a heartfelt appeal to the international community to react decisively and quickly to see to it that such tragedies are not repeated," he said in his weekly address to followers in St. Peter's Square. He asked the crowd to pray "for these brothers and sisters."

Europe must employ "more ships, more overflights by aircraft," French President Francois Hollande said.

Tentative, the old man peered into the scope — through the wrong end. Redirected, he pressed his head to the eyepiece and saw a close-up of Saturn, rising in the night sky. For a long time, he did not move.

In the old world, you walked beneath the stars nightly because you had to. They became your compass, your friends, even your gods. In the new one, you don't because, well, you don't. Humans have been walking under the stars for about 2.3 million years. Only in the past 135 have most of us lost our connection with what shines above.


Then, "He just took off — gone," Ingram says.

Ever since the invention of the light bulb in 1879, darkness has been disappearing. Today, all of Europe and most of the United States east of the Mississippi River never falls into true darkness.


The Northwest falls right in line. A look at our home turf on a "dark sky finder" map of the U.S. — based on data now more than a decade old — is revealing: A broad swath of the most-intense form of light pollution stretches along the Interstate 5 corridor from Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Tacoma, north to Marysville. Less-intense light pollution — still debilitating for naked-eye sky views — forms a massive halo from Centralia north to Vancouver, B.C.

## A Love Of Bright Lights


Much of the research is new, but documented environmental effects range from disrupted growth cycles of trees to the mass deaths of formerly star-navigating birds — up to a billion a year in the U.S. alone, by one estimate — that are tricked into colliding en masse with brightly lit buildings.

There is a simple answer: "full cutoff" lights. These prevent rays from going into the sky where they cause that green glow we're all beginning to accept as darkness.

In the 1960s and 1970s Lincoln's memory was pushed aside. Historians and civil rights activists questioned whether Lincoln was fervent enough in his push to abolish slavery, irrespective of the obstacles he faced in institutionalized slavery and a more overtly racist 19th century.

Lincoln should be honored as someone who died fighting for civil rights, Burlingame said. He should be thought of alongside Martin Luther King and others who were killed for fighting for racial justice.

The verdict is a far cry from one delivered in the Zimmerman case, when he was acquitted in July in the shooting death of 17-year-old Martin in Sanford, about 125 miles south of Jacksonville.

Jordan Davis, a black 17-year-old, was killed in the shooting. But the jury couldn't reach a decision on the murder charge against Dunn. A jury is made of a group of people. The people are American citizens and are randomly selected. When someone is accused of a crime, the jury decides whether the person is innocent or guilty.


"Dunn's attorney argued self-defense, which has been around forever," said Miami defense lawyer and former assistant U.S. Attorney David Weinstein. "I think people will say that because some of the language from the stand-your-ground statute gets embedded into the jury instructions, that stand your ground has an effect."

Lawyers in both cases decided not to ask the  judge to decide if Dunn and Zimmerman could not face charges. They could have asked for this under Florida's stand-your-ground law. But jurors in each case were told by the judges that they should vote not guilty if they found the accused did not have to retreat. In other words, the jurors could decide Dunn and Zimmerman had the right to "stand their ground" and defend themselves.


But the Florida Supreme Court could reduce the total sentence to 20 years if it decides that consecutive sentences are not appropriate when the sentences arise from one criminal episode, said Weinstein.

Judge Russell L. Healey could sentence Dunn to 60 years in prison. State laws call for a sentence of at least 20 years for each second-degree attempted murder conviction.


"This will make the decision to retry Dunn on the murder charge a little more complicated," Weinstein said. "Agreeing on a sentence of less than 60 years and forgoing an appeal might be something that Dunn would be willing to do and it would provide finality for the Davis family."

## To Appeal Verdict


The exhibit curator compared the Abu Dhabi of today to the U.S. in the early 20th century, when it was emerging economically and industrially and private collectors started founding museums to showcase their artistic wealth.

The museum's architect, Jean Nouvel, said these people are wrong. He said they are just jealous that Europe doesn't have the money to pay for expensive cultural projects anymore.


"During this period we said the same thing ... but with hindsight what do we see? It's that European and Asian art are present in the U.S. and participated in making the American culture ... in making the country's identity. And I think that's what needs to be remembered," said curator Vincent Pomerade.

"Do you think we did it any differently in Europe when we used to be more powerful?" Nouvel asked.

The Taliban attempted to silence Malala forever when she was 15. On Oct. 9, 2012, a man shot three bullets into her head.


Her response demonstrated her courage and a seemingly clear-cut rational response to the challenges of living under the Taliban. "If you remain in silence, you will continue to live in terrorism," Malala said. "Or you speak up. In both ways, the consequences are hard."

Hosseini said that the gunman had "shot the girl he was meant to shoot. But in every other way, he shot the wrong girl." The Taliban did not know who they were dealing with, he said. Malala is not someone who gives up easily.


Two other teenagers, Kainat Riaz and Shazia Rehman, were injured in the attack.

Investigators examining the wing fragment in France are trying to glean clues into the plane's fate based on its condition, opening up even more questions: How, exactly, did the plane end up in the water? Was it a controlled landing? Was there an explosion? Who did this, and why?

BAMAKO, Mali - Islamic extremists armed with guns and grenades stormed the Radisson hotel in Mali's capital Friday, and security forces swarmed in to free guests floor by floor. As evening fell, officials said no more hostages were being held and that at least 19 people had been killed.

BAMAKO, Mali — Gunmen attacked the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako on Friday. Bamako is the capital of Mali, a country in West Africa.


An extremist group that two years ago split from al-Qaida's North Africa branch and led by Moktar Belmoktar claimed responsibility for the attack in a recorded statement carried by Al-Jazeera. The group said it wanted fighters freed from Mali's prisons and for attacks against northern Malians to stop.

To make an appointment to see St. Nick at the Minion-themed Ice Palace, which opened Nov. 5, the mall for the first time is requiring a $10 nonrefundable fee, which can be used toward a photo package.

It costs $10 to make an appointment to see Santa, who is at an Ice Palace. The Ice Palace is decorated with characters from the "Minions" movie.


Mary Jo Shepherd, a Schaumburg parent who has brought her kids to Woodfield for years, considers the advance fee "a new level of greed."

"I think it's taking away from the spirit of why we see Santa," Kunets said. "The magic is in meeting Santa. The rest is just extra."


As a social worker, she said she sees families who cannot afford the photo fees. She considers commercial Christmas exhibits, like the holiday window displays at Macy's in downtown Chicago, to be a "give-back" to customers, and was appalled a few years ago when Woodfield stopped letting parents take their own pictures during Santa visits. "It just keeps getting worse and worse every year."

Matthew Caczewe has two daughters and said he understands why malls are charging money. Malls need it for the bigger holiday displays, he said.


Shelly Kunets, a mom from Belvidere, Illinois, who was visiting Woodfield with her newborn recently, said she wouldn't pay to see Santa.

Robert Thompson said it is hard to get angry at the store owners. Thompson teaches at Syracuse University. He said Santa has often been a symbol of money. Just think about Santa's "bag bursting with presents," he said. The presents must cost a great deal of money.

The mammoths were vegetarians, gobbling up 300 to 600 pounds of green eats a day, said another of the staffers at the dig, Bax Barton, a research associate in the Burke's paleontology division.

Forests sprung up as the climate became warmer, said Barton. That left less food for the mammoths.


Scott Koppelman, an executive with the company in Seattle, said that "after getting a little nervous" when told about the discovery of the tusk, we "realized the benefits far outweighed the cost," even if it meant some construction delay.

Sidor said he didn't expect that more mammoth remains would be found. He said animals would have eaten most of the mammoth. The tusk was left untouched because it didn't make for good food.


But Koppelman said "community involvement is very important" to the company.

Koppelman said, "We'll deal with that when we cross it."


MIAMI — Two years after Florida tallied a record number of manatee deaths, state biologists announced Monday that they have documented a near stampede of wintering sea cows in recent months.

MIAMI — How many manatees live in Florida? Scientists just found out.


An annual statewide survey, conducted over several days in February, counted a record high of 6,063 manatees in Florida waters. That's about a thousand more manatees than the previous high counted in 2010 and a welcome turn after 828 deaths in 2013.

Manatees are large, slow animals that live in the sea. They are also known as sea cows. Many manatees live along the coast of Florida. They are in danger. Sometimes boats hit manatees by accident and kill them. The number of manatees has gone down over the years.


"Counting this many manatees is wonderful news," Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Chairman Richard Corbett said in a statement. "The high count this year shows that our long-term conservation efforts are working."

He had been convicted of treason and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 for leading a campaign of sabotage against the government, and sent to the notorious Robben Island prison. It was forbidden to quote him or publish his photo, yet he and other jailed members of his banned African National Congress were able to smuggle out messages of guidance to the anti-apartheid crusade.

Mandela attended Christian schools. After that, he entered a university for black students in 1938. He was expelled two years later for taking part in a student strike.


Yet since apartheid ended, South Africa has held four parliamentary elections and elected three presidents, always peacefully, setting an example on a continent where democracy is still new and fragile. Its democracy has flaws, and the African National Congress has struggled to deliver on promises. It is a front runner ahead of 2014 elections, but corruption scandals and other missteps have undercut some of the promise of earlier years.

## Prison Walls No Match For Mandela


Growing up at a time when virtually all of Africa was under European colonial rule, Mandela attended Methodist schools before being admitted to the black University of Fort Hare in 1938. He was expelled two years later for his role in a student strike.

In 1989, F.W. de Klerk became president. De Klerk was a white South African who realized that the white-only rule of South Africa was coming to an end.


After a two-day nationwide strike was crushed by police, he and a small group of ANC colleagues decided on military action and Mandela pushed to form the movement's guerrilla wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or Spear of the Nation.

Yet since apartheid ended, South Africa has elected three presidents. They have always been elected peacefully. The country has set an example on a continent where democracy is still new and easily broken.


He was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years' hard labor for leaving the country illegally and inciting blacks to strike.

The Commission allowed people of all races who had violated human rights to admit their crimes publicly. In return, they would receive a lighter punishment. It helped heal the nation. Other countries facing similar problems copied South Africa's example.


"I do not deny that I planned sabotage," he told the court. "I did not plan it in a spirit of recklessness, nor because I have any love of violence. I planned it as a result of a calm and sober assessment of the political situation that had arisen after years of tyranny, exploitation and oppression of my people by whites."

"I must step down while there are one or two people who admire me," Mandela joked at the time.

"He tends to exhibit kind of grandiose ideas, and also arrogant and haughty behaviors that become more evident when he's upset," Navy Capt. David Moulton, a psychiatrist who interviewed Manning at length, said at the sentencing hearing.

State Department officials testified about the results of having 250,000 department documents being made public. A military official said the enemy also changed the way it made some bombs based on the leaks.


The defense argued that Manning was a whistle blower who selectively disclosed only certain information that he had access to in order to spark a discussion about U.S. policies.

Military lawyers said that Manning is a "traitor" for sending the documents to the anti-secrecy Web site. Some of the information wound up in the hands of al-Qaida, prosecutors argued. Manning was a junior intelligence officer in Iraq in 2009 and 2010.


On Tuesday, President Barack Obama addressed the nation and described the attack as a terrorist act.

American civilians have not been victims of terror on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001. The New York Times noted that terrorism in the United States is down since the 1970s. The past decade has been especially safe. This is because Sept. 11 led to stricter security and laws.


"Anytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror," he said.

Life could certainly evolve and thrive without organic carbon. In a past watery environment, chemolithoautotrophs would have done just fine with the ingredients already found on Mars. That said, scientists do want to find organic carbon because it would indicate that the planet once had a wider range of life-friendly habitats.

Curiosity has not yet found any carbon. Carbon is the most important element for all life on Earth. But life on Mars could have thrived without carbon, and some lifeforms would have done just fine with what was already here.

Students in Little's class used Miracle-Gro and packing peanuts as organic material to give the Martian soil the capacity to hold nutrients and water. They planted potatoes, beans, rye and parsley. The rye is doing the best, and the potatoes that were started with cut-up potato pieces also are doing well because they started with food storage, Little said.

Her students used composted soil, made from vegetables and leaves that had broken down over weeks. They added the composted soil to the fake Mars soil to try to grow potatoes. They faced many challenges. Many of the potatoes rotted because of diseases in the composted soil.

## Glimpsing The Glass

## Planet Slams Are Not New


The study builds on research from last April, when scientists using data from the Curiosity rover noted that the planet had the seasonal potential for liquid water. We know that because of the extremely low pressure on Mars, water has a boiling point of just a few degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates. The April study noted the presence of perchlorates - a kind of salt - which could make the boiling point of Mars's water much higher, theoretically allowing it to remain liquid. They posited that the planet's temperature would be right for liquid, perchlorate-filled water to form every day during winter and spring.

The new study adds to the research from last year. Scientists using information from the Curiosity rover said that the planet might have had liquid water. The Curiosity rover is a robotic machine that explored Mars. Scientists found that water on Mars evaporated very quickly.


"We're going to places where we thought we were seeing the presence of water and finding chemical evidence of perchlorates," Ojha said. And the correlation goes further than that: The hydrated salts seem to disappear in areas where RSL weren't forming anymore, or were shrinking.

In the new research with Ojha, the scientists studied the RSL. They found high levels of the perchlorate salts. It seems like the salts have been getting water, too.


But a few researchers recently estimated that shergottites are about 4 billion years old — a finding that had far-reaching implications for scientists' understanding of Mars' history. "Most of us understand that if there is to be life on Mars it's not going to be roaming on the surface, but it could be thriving underground with the heat energy provided by volcanism," Humayun said. But "if there hasn't been (volcanic activity in) 4 billion years ... it would be very difficult to believe there was life left on Mars."

Martian space rocks tend to be very old. Shergottites, though, are generally thought to be remarkably young. Most scientists believe they were formed by volcanoes about 150 to 250 million years ago. This would mean they formed during Earth's Jurassic period, when dinosaurs roamed the land.


The problem is, it's very difficult to generate a realistic model of Martian atmospheric evolution that explains how it could have been warm enough, not just thick enough, Vasavada said.

"The puzzle pieces are coming together," Michael Meyer said. Meyer is the head scientist for the U.S. space agency's Mars Exploration Program.

A 17-year-old girl was shocked to learn she was among a handful of women on the list. Since police have contacted people only in Austin so far, the girl, who lives in the South Chicago neighborhood, hasn't been officially informed by police that she made the heat list.

His uncle, Koland Herring, was not surprised to learn that his nephew was on the heat list. Jacobi, he said, had given in to neighborhood peer pressure.


"He's not a hard-core gangbanger. He was never a shooter, burglarizing or stealing cars, anything like that," Herring, 49, said outside his nephew's home as friends and relatives stopped by to pay their respects to the South Shore High School graduate. "Some of the people that he knew did. They're hard-core. And in order to get around and to be accepted out here … you have to be around them."

"We talked about him getting shot all the time," said Herring's father, Floyd Redmond, 41. "I used to see my son hanging out, and I used to ride down on him. I feared for my son being out on these streets because I know what these streets are all about, man."

Ken Klippen, head of the National Association of Egg Farmers, agrees, but isn't exactly applauding the McDonald's decision. He penned an open letter to the company, challenging its assertion that it's more humane to give chickens more room, and reminding them that more manure may come into contact with eggs laid by hens that have access to floors.

"The McDonald's announcement really settles the debate," about the cage-free issue, said Paul Shapiro. He is vice president of farm animal protection for the Humane Society of the U.S. He believes most eggs will be cage-free in the future.


Health researchers who blame fast food for a plethora of ailments, including diabetes and obesity, have become more vocal in arguing that value menus make such meals even more accessible. Low-income consumers who can't afford more nutritious items are especially vulnerable, such experts say.

"Dollar menus are horrifying to me now," she said. "They may be budget-friendly, but the food is just really bad."


Some formerly loyal customers such as Aesha Adams Roberts would now rather buy a bag of dried beans for dinner than order a 99-cent entree.

Flores said McDonald's has watched Vietnam's highly educated young population and seen manufacturing investment being diverted from China, another country where the chain has seen success.

Flores said McDonald's has watched Vietnam's highly educated young population. Money to set up factories is flowing into the country from China. McDonald's has already done well in the Chinese market.


Elizabeth Friend, consumer food service analyst at Euromonitor, said Vietnam has a $33 billion food service industry, making it the 20th-largest market in the world. Although Pizza Hut, KFC and Subway also have locations in Vietnam, chain restaurants only rang up $216 million in receipts last year.




Nancy Salgado, a McDonald's worker at a franchised restaurant in Chicago, said McDonald's move is one victory for the Fight for 15 movement, but it won't affect her or thousands of others employed by franchisees.

Brown doesn't expect everyone to be like Corvin. But he hopes enough people switch from animal protein to a plant-based version to make a difference in the long run.

The United Nations expects people around the world will eat much more meat by 2050. More meat eaters means more strain on the world's water and grain supplies.


The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization projects global meat consumption will rise 73 percent by 2050, putting massive strains on the world's water and grain supplies.

A survey last year showed that only one out of every 20 people are vegetarians in the U.S. There were only slightly more vegetarians in 1999. The meat business doesn't expect a jump in vegetarians in the near future.


"Put simply, there's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people," the expected global population then, Gates wrote in a blog post titled "The Future of Food." "Yet we can't ask everyone to become vegetarians. We need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources."

 Janet Riley is a spokeswoman for the American Meat Institute. She does not think tofu or fake meats will make people stop eating steaks anytime soon.


"We had to mask all this stuff," Brown said. "With our Philly cheese steak, the main event was not the steak. But what if it was? What if you had a true replication?"

"We're not trying to get people to eat kale and quinoa," Brown said. "We're just trying to get your kids and my kids to have a healthier chicken nugget."

Baltimore and Chicago have robust screening and treatment programs. Teachers in one South Florida school district screen children as young as kindergarten by filling out a short questionnaire, while students in Minnesota answer anonymous surveys about drug use and depression. In Olympia, Wash., 21,000 students were screened for substance abuse and mental health issues in 2010, but that dropped to only 7,500 in 2012 due to lack of funding.

It's unknown how many schools offer mental health screenings.


"Once we screen and assess and discover the need, I think it's our responsibility to have the resources in place to service every one of those needs that are uncovered," said Denise Wheatley-Rowe, of Behavioral Health System Baltimore.

Linda Juszczak, the president of the School-Based Health Alliance, said people need to be very cautious when they talk about screening all school children. The screening tests are not perfect. Some students will be falsely identified with mental illnesses. With others, the screening tests will miss very real problems. "The consequences to that are big," she said.


In contrast, Matthew Palma, 10, attended play sessions as a kindergartener as part of Primary Project, which screens 3,000 kindergarten and first-graders in Palm Beach County each year through a one-page assessment completed by teachers. About 650 are referred for play sessions. Children with less severe issues, such as trouble expressing themselves or making friends, attend play therapy weekly for three months. Children with more serious issues are referred for other services.

Dr. Seth Bernstein is a psychologist who is involved in the case. He called it a missed opportunity. The child was never screened for emotional or behavioral issues. A year earlier, a program that offered school support and family counseling had been cut at his school.


The program was approved, and since then the federal government has taken in 4,394 works of art, said Cristina Lopez Beltran, an official at the Tax Administration Service who oversees execution of the Payment in Kind program.

Siqueiros argued that "a painter knows nothing" about "tax law," Margain later wrote. "The only thing we have," Siqueiros said, "are pictures." Perhaps, he suggested, artists could take care of what they owed the government "with the delivery of some paintings."


The campaign follows in the footsteps of high-profile anti-bullying efforts in the United States. As such, it's not surprising that in Mexico the English word has been adopted into the vernacular.

"Mexico is a violent country that tolerates violence," Garza wrote. "Bullying," she said, "has become the word of the moment, signaling any kind of violence, at school or at work, and it's time to call things by their names. Murder is not bullying, it's murder. Assault is not bullying. It's assault."


Using the word "bullearon," 12-year-old Julian Perez said, "I've been bullied because of my stature. I'm short. But I've become used to it and if I don't pay it any mind, they leave me alone."

Because there is no single Spanish word for "bullying," children outside a middle school in Tetelpan on the southern edge of Mexico City use the English word. They pronounced it "boo-leeng." Sometimes they used Spanglish verbs like "buleando."


Sandra Torres, 13, declared one boy in her class a "bulleador" who was under watch, but was a real "nightmare."

"We're very worried about the bullying," said Brenda Quiroz Arteaga, 42. "My daughter was harassed for a long time because she's a little chubby and she suffered a lot … I'm all for expelling from the schools all the students who bullean their schoolmates."


Parent Renata Fernandez, 44, had a slightly different thought.

Using the word "bullearon," 12-year-old Julian Perez said, "I've been bullied because of my stature. I'm short. But I've become used to it and if I don't pay it any mind, they leave me alone."

For his Nexos article, Arriagada counted the photos of light- and dark-skinned people appearing in publications. In a May edition of Club, a social supplement to the Reforma newspaper, he tallied 529 light-skinned people and 11 with darker skin. In a March issue of Caras, published by the Televisa conglomerate, he found 340 light-skinned people and four who were darker.

Arriagada flipped through a copy of Clase. The magazine is an insert in the El Universal newspaper. Clase's pages are filled with photos of wealthy families celebrating social events. He compared them with people in a northern European country known for fair-skinned people with blond hair.


"The first stage was not as transparent as it should have been. We were all suspicious," said Jorge Negrete Pacheco, executive director of Mediatelecom, a consultant in Mexico City on telecommunications regulation.

He also expected to find remnants of Flagler's hotel — well-documented in photographs of early well-heeled tourists — as well as the 19th-century army fort.

Brown was shot and killed last weekend after an encounter with a police officer in his hometown. His death has not only sparked unrest in Ferguson, to the point where President Barack Obama issued a statement, but social media have also exploded, picking up his cause.

It wasn't Michael Brown's photo that inspired her. Rather, it was that the news placed the photo of Brown below one of James Holmes, the Colorado theater shooter. That was what angered her.


Nwaiwu, a varsity cheerleader at GSU, also picked up his cause, posting a picture of herself laughing at a party flashing two peace signs. Next to it is a smiling image of Nwaiwu in her South Cobb High School graduation robe.

Someone posted the photo of Brown in his red Nike tank top flashing a peace sign. The headline read: "Police: Michael Brown Struggled With Officer Before Shooting."


"The assumption is that black males are predators and because of that perceived threat as a predator, you can do anything to them," said David Wall Rice, chairman of the psychology department at Morehouse College. "You can gun them down and not be worried about being convicted, like with Trayvon. You can ask what Michael Brown was doing wrong, instead of what was the person with the gun doing wrong?"

"The one at the party with a peace sign portrays my generation," she said. "But don't get it confused. I still graduated with honors from high school. I am in college. I am a cheerleader and I make good grades. But the media will always show one side of you."


Eric Deggans, television critic for National Public Radio and the author of "Race-Baiter: How the Media Wields Dangerous Words to Divide a Nation," said the use of social media, particularly among African-Americans, has given voice to people who might otherwise have been silenced.

Al Tompkins is a teacher at the Poynter Institute, a school for journalism in Florida. He posted on the school's website that the hashtag campaign forces people to think how images are viewed.


"With social media, we get to tell our story," Deggan said. "We don't have to depend on the editor of The New York Times having empathy for our stories. We can put up a blog post or Tweet that reflects our attitude and it reaches millions of people in a way more potent than The New York Times."

"No single image can define an individual," Tompkins said. "A booking photo could be a single image of a person at the worst moment of his or her life. A wedding photo could be that same person at the best moment of his or her life. Both are extremes."


"Being a black man in America, I'm already at a disadvantage and that no matter how well we may be doing for ourselves and no matter how well we present ourselves, there will always be someone or a group of people trying to bring us down and taint our image," said Bembry, 24, who works for an oil and gas company in Texas. "That's what the hashtag is all about. Nobody is perfect, no matter what our skin color is, but African-Americans seem to catch the most hell from the white community in these situations."

"With social media, we get to tell our story," Deggan said. "We can put up a blog post or Tweet that reflects our attitude and it reaches millions of people."


Morehouse's Rice, who teaches a course called "Black men, Black boys and the Psychology of Modern Media," recalls the teachings of W.E.B. Du Bois to provide a historical context. Du Bois, who taught at Atlanta University at the turn of the last century, pioneered the concept of "double consciousness," which refers to the psychological challenge of reconciling an African heritage with a European upbringing and education.

Tarshia Stanley, head of the Spelman College English Department, said that she agrees that the hashtag campaign has been positive. However, she worries about that it won't lead to further action.


Increasingly, the first lady has incorporated anti-violence messages in her speeches, particularly in her visits to Chicago. Like President Barack Obama often does, she stressed the need for Congress to at least take a vote on gun control measures.

## Scared On A Sunny Day


Obama, her voice cracking with emotion and her hand placed near her heart, said Hadiya's story reminded her of her own.

"I shared with her that I would stay inside, in 85-degree sunny weather, because I'm scared walking down the street. I fear for my life. I feel today could be my last day," said Ronald Ligon, 16. "She said she would do everything in her power to stop the violence that goes on. I know that she really do care. Now I feel this is a new beginning for me."

But when food and media companies — including many that supported her anti-obesity campaign — mounted a fierce lobbying battle against the guidelines in 2011, the first lady went silent.

Obama told food companies "to step it up" to improve the foods they advertise for children. She also wants them to limit the amount of ads for less healthy foods in TV commercials.

"I want to put Palestinian food all over the world," said Sakakini. "But over here, it's just putting food on the table."

## Ramallah Rejects Fancy Food


Skilled staff members are sparse in a land with few culinary schools. Sakakini's head chef is a full-time schoolteacher from the West Bank city of Hebron. There are no full-time Palestinian food critics or gastronomy magazines to spur innovation. Peter Nasir, who had hoped his Azure restaurant would become a culinary destination, recently lamented that chicken chow mein was about all the adventure his clientele would tolerate.

## In Tel Aviv, Food Is The Star


The scene is much different in Israel.

"It's very emotional for me," Sakakini said of the global love affair with Israeli food. "It's the same kitchen."


The international acclaim is just the icing on the cake because Israelis eagerly devour their own food as well. The local edition of "MasterChef," now in its fifth season, is among the highest-rated TV shows. Israelis also pioneered and exported a reality cooking TV format called "Game of Chefs."

## Palestinian Chefs Make It Big In Israel


"'MasterChef' was the place that gave me a platform to continue," Atamna-Ismaeel said as she spread the yogurt cheese labaneh on a glass platter. "It helped me decide. I always said, 'I know I cook well, but maybe not well enough.'"

Peter Nasir is a Palestinian who studied computer science in Atlanta. He discovered his love of food while cooking for friends.


Nasir's quandary highlights the grinding realities of life in Ramallah. The average Israeli annual salary is 10 times the average Palestinian's of about $3,000. A quarter of Palestinian workers are employed by their government, and when the national budget runs low — as happened in February when Israel froze the transfer of taxes to Ramallah — business slows down.

Nasir can travel in Israel freely. He said his favorite restaurant is in Israel. It costs the same as a restaurant in Ramallah, he says, but the food is more interesting.


On his way back to Ramallah, Nasir buys Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise outside Tel Aviv to skirt the double taxation imposed by Israel and the Palestinian government on imported goods.

Sari Sakakini is excited.

Claudia started school each fall riding a school bus with other labor camp kids to Aptos Junior High, a buzzing school splashed with murals in a largely affluent community. After Thanksgiving, she moved to Palo Verde Union School in Tulare, a newer campus in a low-income community.

"We are not aware of members of families being in jams or having a problem with having to move away," said Guerdon Stuckey, a state official. He said some families are not looking for permanent housing, and some even enjoy the lifestyle.


Claudia started physics this fall in her science class. In September, they formed teams to build a roller coaster. She told her teacher she'd be gone before the due date and so she sat that one out, a lucky break, she said.

In tweets, passengers also described seeing migrants running along the roofs of another train near the migrant-besieged French port of Calais.

In Iceland, people have used social media to challenge the government's promise to take in just 50 Syrians. Some people have offered to let a war refugee stay with them. Others have tried to persuade the government to turn an unused army base into migrant housing.


"I have researched our journey for more than two months," said Zaidah, a native of the Syrian city of Aleppo who has worked the past two years as an accountant in Istanbul, Turkey. "I used social media networks to look into where to go, who is the best smuggler to hire and what stuff we needed for the trip," he said as he had chocolate cake and coffee at a posh seafront cafe, his sneakers still wet from the landing.

## Who Needs A Map? Use A Cellphone


Halfway through the walk, the migrants look dazed, dragging their feet up and down one hill after another, taking occasional breaks in the shade on the side of the road. Jouan, a 29-year-old English teacher from Syria, arrived in Mytilene after a 16-hour walk, chafed and exhausted. "No one stopped for me, though they did pick up old people or families," he said Wednesday, speaking on condition he be identified only by his first name to protect family back in Syria.

During the sea journey, they keep their phones in plastic bags to keep them dry. They land in Lesbos, a Greek island, chanting, "Thanks be to God." The first thing they do is take their phones out and joyously hug. Then they take group selfies on the shore. They call loved ones back in Turkey, Syria or Iraq, shouting, "We arrived in Greece!"


The rival smuggler was furious and pulled a gun on one of Zaida's friends, Mohammed Seraj. "He pointed it at my head and said, 'I can kill you now and no one will know, or I can call my coast guard friends who will alert the police to your group and come and arrest you.'"

The group finally found their own smuggler. At dawn, he made them carry heavy boxes down to the beach. They had to assemble the boat themselves. Then the smuggler left them to steer the boat themselves.


Six other states also had population losses for the year: Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, New Mexico and Vermont. And like West Virginia, many are struggling to provide economic opportunity. New Mexico, Connecticut and Maine had some of the lowest rates of job creation in recent years.

## California's Loss Is Oregon's Gain


Florida's gain of almost 366,000 people to a population of 20,271,272 was its largest in a decade and reflects another cause behind the renewed exodus to the Sun Belt: The nation's swollen population of baby boomers now feels more secure economically in picking up and moving to traditional retirement oases.

In Oregon, many young people are moving to Portland. This is a big city where technology is big business. Josh Lehner is an economist who works for the state. He says there is not enough housing for all of the people who want to live here. 


"The state continues to attract retiring baby boomers because of our climate and the relatively low costs of living," said Richard Doty, a demographer with the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. "You can sell a home in New York or Ohio or Michigan for substantially more than you would spend in Florida, so it's still relatively attractive."

Many of the people moving to Oregon are from California. They leave because housing in California is expensive. An average home in California costs two-thirds more than in Oregon, for example.


Take, for example, Sumter County, west of Orlando, one of Florida's fastest-growing counties, driven in large part by retirees. It is projected to have a median age of 78 by 2020, Doty said.

John Malson studies populations for California. He says the cost of housing limits the number of people willing to move to the state. This includes people who are offered high-paying, high-tech jobs in cities like San Francisco. 


The question is whether the sheltered, subsidized lifestyle on this heavily guarded mega-base, and others like it, has reinforced the separation of the all-volunteer military from the nation it serves.

## Combining Bases Helps Communities


Crangle is not seeking financial help for Flo's surgery, but he wants to bring to light the dilemma faced by owners of retired military dogs. The Menomonee Falls-based volunteer group War Dogs, which honors military dogs by marching in parades and giving historical presentations, has helped with Flo's veterinary bills so far.

## Now The U.S. Brings War Dogs Home


Earlier this month, a dozen fresh recruits and wannabe warriors showed up for push-ups and jumping jacks. Among them: Kyle Bayard, of Drexel, Mo., whose lifelong dream of serving was held up for a year because he had been prescribed attention-deficit medicine in high school.

## Turning Them Away


On Hoard's desk were slips bearing the names of four local candidates rejected for having tattoos that crept too low on their forearms. All four were turned down the week after the Army's tattoo restrictions took effect April 29.

Twelve interested people show up at his office to work out. Among them is Kyle Bayard. His dream of serving was held up for a year. He took attention-deficit disorder (ADD) medicine in high school.


"Five years ago, if a kid had gotten caught with a (marijuana) joint in his car, that person would be pretty much a shoo-in" to enlist under a waiver, Hoard said. "Now, you're not authorized."

Nathan Christensen, a Navy official, said that the quality of new sailors and soldiers is the best it's been in 40 years.


Since the majority of people applying to the armed forces are male, this represents a thorny problem for military recruiters who are trying to meet their enlistment goals.

## Young Women Wanted


According to the group, U.S. national security depends not just on having enough missiles and fighter jets, but also enough preschools and gym classes.

The change came about because enrollment at the school known as North Valley Charter Academy began plummeting, partly due to the construction of new high schools nearby. Principal Diane French and other administrators sought a way to boost the student body's numbers that also would fit with the school's mission — academic excellence, democratic leadership and personal growth.

They are the first students at North Valley Military Institute. It is a Los Angeles Unified School District charter school, a public school that is operated by a private company. It was changed this year from a traditional school to one filled with military values and order.


"Sit-ups!" Diab ordered as the students hit the deck. After a few minutes, one student jokingly shouted: "I can feel the burn … sir!"

## "It Has Taught Me Self-Control"


Although the Department of Defense didn't request 2015 funds, Congress allocated an additional $175 million for the Public Schools on Military Installations Program in December.

## Money Has Not Magically Appeared


The needed upgrades at Branch, which ranks eighth out of 160 schools on the Pentagon's priority list, will cost $27.8 million — meaning that the district would have to come up with about $5.5 million.

## They Cannot Pay For Repairs


While noting that, on average, men and women have different physical abilities, Carter said the services must assign tasks and jobs based on ability rather than on gender. He said that would likely result in fewer women in some jobs. Equal opportunity, he said, will not mean equal participation in some specialty jobs. But he added that combat effectiveness is still the main goal, and there will be no quotas for women in any posts.

Carter's announcement means that women now can serve in the military's most difficult and dangerous jobs. Special operations forces, such as the Army Delta units and Navy SEALs, had been closed to them. These elite units perform special missions. They often go behind enemy lines.


A senior defense official said the services will have to begin putting plans in place by April 1. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

While Bryant said her 5-year-old is "crazy for milk," her older daughter barely drinks any. She might be lactose-intolerant, a condition Americans have become increasingly aware of, and one that is a brake on milk sales.

Milk is one of the best sources of vitamin D and calcium, said Deb Sheats. She is a professor at St. Catherine University in St. Paul.


"It's really one of our best sources of vitamin D and calcium," said Deb Sheats, a nutrition and dietetics professor at St. Catherine University in St. Paul. Vitamin D and calcium are important nutrients that often get shorted in the American diet.

## "Milk Life" Ads


The infrared images that make up the new portrait provide revelations about the Milky Way's content and structure. They add more than 200 million new stars to the catalog of the Milky Way — plenty of astrophysical data to occupy a new generation of astronomers, according to scientists involved with the research.

## Meet Spitzer


The composite gives scientists some idea of the metabolic rate of the Milky Way, said UW-Madison astronomer Barb Whitney, one of the leaders of the GLIMPSE team. "It tells us how many stars are forming each year."

"We can see stars being born," astronomer Edward Churchwell said. "And if we can identify stars in the process of forming, we can start to learn" more about "how stars are formed. We don't really understand the details of how stars are born."


The 360-degree portrait will help astronomers gain a deeper understanding of the dust that lies between the stars and us, Churchwell said.

Scientist Robert Benjamin says they can now see every region that forms stars in the galaxy.


Black millennials also, unsurprisingly, showed much stronger support than their white and Hispanic counterparts for "Black Lives Matter," the protest movement sparked by recent police killings of black men in Ferguson, Missouri; New York City, and other cities.

## More Blacks Are Found To Have Doubts


Many polled strongly agreed with some solutions that protest movements have helped bring to the forefront. About 80 percent believe requiring police officers to wear body cameras can be effective, for example.

Still, American millennials as a group don't believe that the movement will be able to cause meaningful change. Just 39 percent of those polled believed the efforts would be "somewhat" or "very" effective.


African-Americans are also more likely to use Facebook to keep up with what's "trending" on social media — 41 percent of African-Americans compared with 29 percent of whites and 24 percent of Hispanics.

## Blacks And Hispanics Love Smartphones


Those who are Hispanic or African-American are more likely than white millennials to get news and information from YouTube (38 percent of Hispanics compared with 33 percent of African-Americans and 20 percent of whites) and Instagram (30 percent of Hispanics compared with 45 percent of African-Americans and 19 percent of whites).

Tom Rosenstiel runs the group that did the study. He said people of color use technology just as often, and just as well, as white people.


The survey of 1,045 young adults, including 163 non-Hispanic African-Americans and 162 Hispanics, was conducted from Jan. 5 through Feb. 2, 2015. It was conducted by the Media Insight Project, a partnership between the AP-NORC Center and the American Press Institute, which funded the study.

It's part of a movement that aims to motivate kids through familiar and beloved technology. Teachers are using games such as Assassin's Creed to illustrate the Revolutionary War and World of Warcraft to inspire creative writing exercises, but nothing has had the impact of "Minecraft," which has more than 100 million registered users worldwide.

## Legos On The Computer


"It's an experience you can't replicate any other way," Stewart said. "It's kind of, sort of, like walking through it in real life."

"The secret sauce is that kids are engaged," said Joel Levin. His company, TeacherGaming, has sold the "MinecraftEdu" to 2,500 schools worldwide. "They love it. They want to do it."


Quest Academy, a private school in Palatine, has incorporated the game into Heidi Senetra's fifth-grade class this year, using it to reinforce lessons on J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit." Since November, students have been building their own fantasy worlds — designed to be populated by virtual dragons — and writing about the adventures they have there.

## "They Can Build Anything"


Maria Cipollone, a Ph.D. candidate in media and communication at Temple University, recently used the game in a research project at a Philadelphia public school, asking kids to re-create famous buildings such as Rockefeller Center in "Minecraft."

Dan Rezac, who is with the Northbrook school, said "Minecraft" can be amazing.


She found that while the game helped the students develop conceptual math skills such as estimating proportions, it didn't translate into the sort of arithmetic prowess that would boost a standardized test score.

"With 'Minecraft,' they can build anything," he said. They can learn social skills so they can work together with other people. They can build worlds and lands and objects. They can even re-create the human body so they can test diseases on it.


"I think what you find is that there's so much crisis education going on that there's no space for tools like 'Minecraft,'" she said.

There's no limit to what kids can do with "Minecraft," he said.

In part because of its Canadian roots, hockey for years has been watched and played primarily by whites, experts said. But according to the National Hockey League, that is slowly changing. There are more minorities on NHL rosters in recent years—peaking at 50 in 2009 — than in the decades before. And NHL research shows a small uptick in the percentage of fans who are minorities, the league said.

"It makes us all feel good to see a Chicago team out there winning—race doesn't matter," she said.


Vic Ortiz, 46, who is Mexican-American and lives on the South Side, considers himself an avid Chicago sports fan. But for years, he took little interest in the Blackhawks because the games were too expensive and most of the home games were not televised, he said.

"It's not a sport you can go in your backyard and play," said Jimmy Terracino, of the Bobby Hull Ice Rink in Cicero. "You've got to have an ice rink. You need skates, you need sticks, helmets, gloves, elbow pads, shin guards. That limits many people from playing or learning it."


The push for a higher minimum wage has gained momentum over the past few years. Seattle, San Francisco and most recently Los Angeles have adopted a floor of $15 an hour to take effect over the next few years. That's more than double the current federal minimum wage law of $7.25.

## No One Knows For Sure


How all of these competing forces play out is anybody's guess. But as the push for higher minimum wages spreads, workers and employers are already beginning to envision life in a $15-an-hour world.

Last year, football players at Northwestern, led by quarterback Kain Colter, tried to unionize team members. Colter's efforts ultimately failed, but many of the benefits the movement sought — guaranteed four-year scholarships and athletic scholarships that cover the full cost of attendance — are now a reality across wide swaths of Division I.

The success of the players strike should be a lesson "to all of the athletes across the country that you do have power," Harris said. It all started with a few players "on our team and look what it's become," he said. "Look where it's at right now."

Twelve other players were given 50-game suspensions in connection with Biogenesis, the Miami-area doping clinic that supplied high-profile players, including the New York Yankees' slugger, with banned substances from 2009 until last year, MLB alleges.

The punishment runs for 211 games. That is the length of the rest of this season and all of the 2014 season. Rodriguez was once expected to become baseball's all-time home run king. Now he will forever be remembered as the central figure in one of the game's worst scandals.


"I'm in the toughest fight of my life and it's not going to get easier,'' he said Monday. "I'm fighting for my life.''

Most of the players negotiated the terms of their suspensions over the past month. They chose to admit responsibility, sit out immediately, and return as quickly as possible to the diamond.


Rodriguez, who grew up in Miami, has a $275 million contract and is the highest-paid player in baseball. He previously admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs when he played for the Rangers in 2001-03, after the results of a confidential drug test were leaked, but has never been disciplined.

He did not answer questions about his use of banned substances. They are called performance enhancing drugs. In the past, he has said he had not used them since his days as a Texas Ranger.


Though the players union has cooperated with baseball in its effort to clean up the sport — and has supported the suspensions — Executive Director Michael Weiner said the union would defend Rodriguez because Selig did not "act appropriately'' in his case. Weiner did not elaborate.

Rodriguez has a $275 million contract. He is the highest-paid player in baseball. He previously admitted taking performance-enhancing drugs when he played for the Rangers in 2001-03, but has never been disciplined.


Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Melky Cabrera, Oakland Athletics pitcher Bartolo Colon and Padres catcher Yasmani Grandal, all of whom already have served 50-game suspensions as a result of violations stemming from their connections to Biogenesis, will not receive additional discipline.

The latest suspensions follow the July 22 punishment of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers. Braun was suspended for the rest of this season.

Publisher Harper announced Tuesday that "Go Set a Watchman," a novel the Pulitzer Prize-winning author completed in the 1950s and put aside, will be released July 14. Rediscovered last fall, "Go Set a Watchman" is essentially a sequel to "To Kill a Mockingbird," although it was finished earlier. The 304-page book will be Lee's second, and the first new work in more than 50 years.

Since 1960, it has been Harper Lee's only published book. After more than 50 years, she is publishing her second book. It has the same characters as "To Kill a Mockingbird."


Financial terms were not disclosed. The deal was negotiated between Carter and the head of Harper's parent company, Michael Morrison of HarperCollins Publishers. "Watchman" will be published in the United Kingdom by William Heinemann, an imprint of Penguin Random House.

Harper Lee explained how "Watchman" and "Mockingbird" came to be in a statement released by her publisher.

In response, Miami-Dade County plans to increase boundaries for spraying around three areas totaling nearly 2,000 acres where endangered Florida leafwing and Bartram's hairstreak butterflies live. The county has also decided to stop spraying on a patchwork of environmentally endangered land inhabited by native butterflies, said Craig Grossenbacher, chief of the county's Water Resources Coordination Division.

Fred Culbertson, who is piloting the test flights, acknowledged that mosquito hunting will be "a learning experience" for both sides. "But we feel that once we get down and work with them for a couple of days, we can probably tweak things to make it work."
## Like A Paper Airplane


Insect-control experts are hoping that deploying the laboratory mosquitoes will eventually slash the number of wild mosquitoes in people's neighborhoods. The tricky part is that although certain strains of Wolbachia are already common in many species of mosquitoes—including some that bite humans—this desired type of Wolbachia does not naturally reside in Aedes Albopictus, the species of mosquitoes that had cropped up in the L.A. area during the past four years. So scientists had to artificially infect them.

## More Mosquitoes To The Rescue?


The biology of how Wolbachia interact with their hosts is a bit complex. If a male mosquito with Wolbachia mates with an uninfected female, then their eggs will not hatch. That is the key to Dobson's approach. Yet if two mosquitoes that both have Wolbachia mate, then their resulting eggs will hatch as normal, although the offspring will potentially harbor Wolbachia. Basically, their lives will go on as usual and they will be able to reproduce. Similarly, if an infected female mates with an uninfected male, then their resulting eggs will also hatch as normal—although again, the offspring will potentially also be infected.

The doctors infect the mosquitoes with a bacteria called Wolbachia. It makes them unable to help make eggs. Bacteria are tiny living things that can cause disease. Eggs are created when males partner with females. 


In the U.S., however, Dobson does not want Wolbachia to become established—he just wants to control the mosquito population. His method is an alternative to pesticide use, he says. Yet a major reason O'Neill and others are not using this same approach is because scaling it up over large tracts can prove quite difficult—requiring a continual influx of the mosquitoes that involves raising and releasing many, many of the insects. Wiping out one species of mosquito also means that others could potentially come in and fill that niche. But in an area like Los Angeles County where there were not any mosquitoes that carry dengue or chikungunya until recently, Dobson says it makes sense to try to target this disease-carrying population—making competing mosquitoes less of a priority. And in other areas where pesticide use is common, tapping mosquitoes like these could help reduce chemical use, serving as a way to complement it, he adds.

## These Are Bad Eggs, And That's Good!


If Panama's National Biosafety Commission gives the green light, sometime early next year technicians will release tens of thousands of gene-altered mosquitoes in Arraijan, a bedroom community that's across the canal from Panama City at the canal's Pacific end.

Oxitec mosquitoes are all male. They contain a "lethality gene." When the mosquitoes are released into the wild, they mate with females but the offspring don't survive. That's why they're called dead-end bugs.


"The mosquito dies in a few days. So it's very improbable that it will go into the environment or into another organism," Sosa said. "It's not that we are doing something that is environmentally unfriendly."

Hadyn Parry is in charge of Oxitec. He said that his company thought its mosquito was safer than using insecticides, which he said "affect all insects in a given area." Insecticides can also get into other animals and the environment, and stick around.


Mosquito control officials in the Florida Keys announced last year that they were considering testing the Oxitec mosquito. In response, a Key West businesswoman gathered more than 120,000 names on a petition, halting the plan temporarily.

Dead-end mosquitoes only affect one species, he said. "It's a highly targeted sniper's rifle."

So willing are we to believe that today's young adults are a coddled, shiftless lot that every study directed at this generation of 18- to 31-year-olds is cause for renewed hand-wringing.

All signs show that they're a generation doing it their own way. And it may be the right way.


Indeed, fewer young adults are marrying — just 25 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds were married in 2012, compared with 30 percent in 2007. And those who do marry are delaying their unions — the median age for marriage today is 27 for women and 29 for men, according to the Pew Research Center. In 1960, it was 20 for women and 22 for men.

## More Holes And More Questions


SEATTLE — Mount St. Helens' Crater Glacier continues to grow while most others around the world are shrinking.

SEATTLE — In 1980, Mount St. Helens volcano in Washington state erupted.


The guided, glacier-view hike exempts visitors from some of those restrictions and allows them to scramble off-trail to the vantage point. Mount St. Helens Institute debuted the outing three years ago and is expanding the schedule to nine dates this year, beginning in late July.

Scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Cascades Volcano Observatory have been visiting the area since the early 1980s.


"Nothing about this glacier is typical," said USGS scientist Steve Schilling.

## The Perfect Snow Spot


By 1988, a permanent snowfield more than 200 feet thick nestled in the crater. In 1996, the first crevasses appeared — evidence that the frozen mass was in motion and met the definition of a glacier.

That is when the volcano came back to life. It spit steam and oozed thick lava for several years.


But things really got weird in 2004.

## "It's Pretty Exciting"


That's when the volcano sputtered back to life, intermittently spitting steam and oozing thick, pasty magma in a low-key eruption that lasted for several years. The magma quickly built a new dome taller than the Empire State Building, and it wedged between the old dome and the crater wall.

Now, the glacier is creeping farther down the valley. A stream of melted water springs from the base of the glacier. It waters trees and flowers down below.


But even from the vantage point afforded by Yurkewycz's guided hike, Crater Glacier doesn't look much like other Northwest glaciers. The surface is so littered with volcanic rock that only a few glints of blue ice are visible.

They went in through a funnel-shaped mouth they called the Godzilla Hole, said Jared Smith. He is the lead guide for the Mount St. Helens Institute.


"The top is very hummocky," Schilling said. "It almost looks like it's made of rock."

"It's probably 80 or 90 feet straight down," Smith said. Inside, they found a steamy wonderland of ice and tunnels.


His perspective stands in contrast to what John Pennington, head of Snohomish County's Department of Emergency Management, said at a news conference Monday. "It was considered very safe," Pennington said. "This was a completely unforeseen slide. This came out of nowhere."

"We've known that it's been failing," he said of the hill.


"They didn't even stop pounding nails," said Tracy Drury, an environmental engineer and applied geomorphologist who assessed the area with Miller soon after the landslide. "We were surprised."

John Lovick is in charge of running Snohomish County. He and Public Works Director Steve Thomsen said Monday night they were not aware of the 1999 report. A slide of this size "is very difficult to predict," Thomsen said. "There was no indication, no indication at all."

## Millions Of Tons Of Dirt


After two landslides on the hill — one in 1949, another in 1951 — two state agencies, the Department of Game and the Department of Fisheries, commissioned a report from Seattle engineering firm William D. Shannon and Associates.

There have been at least five slides on the site.


Shannon concluded that a main cause of the slides is the river eroding the "toe" of a previous slide, which supports the millions of tons of dirt behind it, like someone with their back against a bulging door. Eventually, the toe would fail and gravity would pull the mountain down again.

"We have to reimagine our relationships with nature to accommodate modern, increasingly diverse communities that see the world differently than white Anglo-Saxon Protestants like Muir did in the late 19th century," Waldie said.

Laura Pulido is a professor at USC. She said Muir's feelings should be understood as being part of his time.


"For many communities of color, nature of great significance isn't out there in distant charismatic Sierra peaks; it's in urban parks, in local mountains and along local rivers — and under their fingertips in the stuff they grow in their own backyards," he said.

Pulido said, "He was a man of his times, who actively worked to disgrace California Indians by taking their lands."


"And the feet are really tall," said another. "This is going to be interesting."

## Seeing A Mummy's Insides


"I'm not saying it's a rational fear," Blumenfield told the audience in the council chamber. "But you can't dismiss them as not important because people have these fears."

## Taking Art To The Walls


"The Boulder Holder" pose, a selfie that museum-goers take with artist Michael Heizer's "Levitated Mass" sculpture at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is so popular that one Instagram count of pictures of the artwork under the museum's  lacma hashtag potentially reached 175,000 people in a week.

"The Boulder Holder" is a picture that museum visitors have taken of themselves with a giant rock. That giant rock is also a piece of art.


The Philadelphia Museum of Art's selfie spots are its "Rocky" statue and the inspiring run up its stone steps, fists overhead. The National Gallery in Oslo has Edvard Munch's "The Scream," glutting the Internet with agonized selfies.

Ann Philbin is in charge of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles. She said the good thing about selfies is that people can share their experiences. When people see the photos, more people come to the museum. Selfies also help young people to connect.


"They were not just saying so, but the physiological responses were in accord with what they were saying," said the study's lead author, cognitive psychologist Josep Marco Pallares of the Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute in Barcelona.

## No Pleasure From Music


"In general, it's thought that there is a continuum in the degree of pleasure you get from rewards," Marco said. "This is not completely true. There are differences, but this kind of activity depends on the type of stimuli. There are different kinds of stimuli which may be more effective in activating the reward system, and some that might not be effective at all."

## Hard Time Picking Music


"We're seeing a rise in the number of adolescents with hearing loss, which is not a surprise when you look at our society, which has gotten busier, nosier and overstimulated," said Dr. Henry Ou, an associate professor of pediatric otolaryngology at Seattle Children's Hospital.

"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," said Pellar, a doctor. "I also have concerns when I walk by my kids when they have their earbuds in and I can still hear their music. And the longer they listen, the louder it seems to get."


A recent performance at Stanford showed the promise of using Internet speed to build cultural bridges through music.

## The Music Was Slow Enough


Lisiecki also will be going to Spain, and then finally to Washington, D.C., where he will make his debut at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in a March 28 recital. The recital is sold out, according to the Kennedy Center's online calendar.

## Hola, Spain. Hello, Washington


Not long after that engagement, Lisiecki will be back at the Kennedy Center on April 7 to appear with the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, performing as a soloist in Edvard Grieg's "Piano Concerto in A Minor."

After that, Lisiecki will be going to Spain. He will wrap up his travels with a March 28 concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Lisiecki plays classical music. He will perform pieces by Bach, Mendelssohn and Paderewski at the concert. The Kennedy Center's website says the concert is sold out.


"We never allegro in the hallways, right?" said Morgan-Brist, who co-founded the nonprofit program with her good friend, violin teacher Kelly Carter, under the name ACME (Advocates for Community through Musical Excellence).

"Adagio means what?" asked music teacher Patricia Morgan-Brist. She was speaking about how fast to play the music.


"We saw something about El Sistema on '60 Minutes' and thought, we need that here," she said.

"Slow motion!" the students replied all together. Then they moved on to andante — "Walking speed!" — and allegro, which means quickly in Italian.


Carter has played with several community orchestras around Minneapolis.

"We never allegro in the hallways, right?" said Morgan-Brist. She started the music program with her good friend, violin teacher Kelly Carter. They called it ACME. That stands for Advocates for Community through Musical Excellence.


To appreciate the extent to which she is "defying retail gravity," as former Billboard editor Bill Werde phrased it to NPR, consider this: In the week before the release of "1989," the top 200 albums on the Billboard chart sold a combined total of 1.53 million copies, barely outpacing "1989."

## iTunes Versus Spotify


And this week R&amp;B star Aloe Blacc chimed in, penning an anti-streaming piece for Wired magazine, which tweeted out the headline: "I support Taylor Swift — streaming services are killing music."

In her article over the summer, Swift wrote: "Music is art, art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for."


Despite those misgivings, Spotify is a pretty good deal: $9.99 a month for ease of use in building and sharing playlists, and the ability to hear a song once it pops into your head, like when you're driving to work and playing Mott the Hoople's "All the Young Dudes" seems absolutely necessary at that very moment.

Swift is an expert at connecting with her fans. Even pulling her music off Spotify has helped her. Her fans must prove how much they love her by buying her album.

For Hurley, an associate professor of music who is on the board of American Voices, the St. Louis-based group that's sponsoring the trips with State Department support, the experiences he's had in Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Thailand have been life-altering for him and, he thinks, for his students.

## It's All One Language — Music


In a performance with the Taipei Symphony Orchestra, Dillingham launched into "Orange Blossom Special," a bluegrass favorite that showcases the fiddle, but which drew the classical musicians in.

## Hip-Hop Goes Global


"We did what we did; tell hip-hop through a story, and people gravitated to us," Hill said in an interview. "They knew it on YouTube and multimedia."

Mark Katz, a music professor at the University of North Carolina, is leading a new two-year program for the government, which is all about hip-hop.


They said getting children, teens and young adults more involved in the mosque will help them learn true Islam and counter what they say are murderous distortions purveyed by the extremists in France — as well as by Boko Haram in Nigeria, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and various al-Qaida groups carrying out their own reigns of terror.

## Messages Of Peace


"I've never come across any video, email, message" where such views were discussed, said Wasi Mohamed, a University of Pittsburgh student who helps coordinate the food pantry program. Radicalization, he said, seems to be taking place in isolated groups or individuals.

Muslims do not show Muhammad in pictures because the religion warns believers only to worship God, not an image or object showing God.


In North Carolina, the mustangs are left dodging tourists, developers and birth defects. Gus Cothran, an expert in equine genetics at Texas A&amp;M University, published a DNA analysis in 2012 warning that the Corolla herd was becoming dangerously inbred.

## Nowhere To Go


Linn Naing, dressed in a blue skirtlike wrap called a lungyi, with a cellphone in his breast pocket, sails past crumbling colonial-era edifices, their paint faded to pale yellow and light sienna. He breezes by billboards advertising Laser toothpaste and Mercedes-Benzes, and an Internet cafe called Google.

He bikes past old buildings, billboards and an Internet cafe called Google. Shiny new apartment towers rise to the sky. They are signs of the changes in Yangon, the country's largest city. New white taxis run around the slow old buses, another sign of the modern times coming to Myanmar.


In many Southeast Asian cities, bicycle rickshaws and sidecars have been driven to extinction by cheap Chinese and Japanese motorcycles and scooters that whiz and beep noisily along congested boulevards.

## Motorbike Ban Boosts The Sidecar Business


Still, getting into the business is not cheap. A bicycle and sidecar can cost about $200; a license is $300. Unlike many drivers, Linn Naing owns his sidecar, which means he doesn't have to pay a $2 to $3 daily fee to rent his ride.

That is good news for thousands of sidecar drivers in the city like Linn Naing. It costs just 20 cents to 50 cents for a trip, which makes sidecars cheaper than taxis for short trips.


The families of the missing, of course, would face the most painful consequences of a failed search.

## The Bermuda Triangle


Dolezal has been lauded for revitalizing Spokane's chapter of the 106-year-old civil rights organization. But according to court documents obtained Monday by the Los Angeles Times, when she was a graduate student in art at Howard University, she sued the historically black school in Washington, D.C., charging that she was a victim of racial discrimination.

Baz Dreisinger is the author of the book "Near Black: White-to-Black Passing in American Culture." Many people are willing to think openly about race, she said. Still, many people are stuck thinking that "black is black and white is white." When a situation like this comes up, "it's a shocker," Dreisinger said.


Rachel Dolezal's father said they had not spoken up about their daughter's race before because they had never been asked.

"We hope that Rachel will get the help she needs to deal with her identity issues," her mother, Ruthanne Dolezal, said on NBC's "Today" show Monday morning.


Rachel Dolezal had not spoken publicly about the uproar before Tuesday, when she appeared on the "Today" show.

The NAACP national president, Cornell William Brooks, spoke in an interview on Monday with the Times. Dolezal was widely respected in Spokane, he said. There is "a great deal of disappointment and pain now."


When pressed about the fact that Dolezal lied about her identity, Brooks said, "No. Lying is not consistent with our values."

"An African-American can never wake up and say, 'I'm gonna make my hair blond, put on white makeup and go through my day as a white person,'" Prince said.

The study is among a number of recent genetic findings that have radically altered the long and heated debate over how humans came to inhabit the New World.

Naia's hip bone was shattered from the fall. Unable to escape, she died in the hole.


John Hoffecker, a paleoarchaeologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said the paper would help reshape debate on the origins of the first Americans.

## A Land Surrounded By Ice


The girl's remains are being stored in a laboratory in Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City, according to study coauthor Pilar Luna Erreguerena, the head of underwater archaeology at the institute.

All Native Americans have the same roots, study leader James Chatters said. They are "descended from the same homeland."


"Owners need to be prepared to replace and restore that mortar to a safe condition. That's a very expensive undertaking," Turner said.

## Tearing A Hole In The Wall


The owner of those three buildings, Brian Silver, said he hadn't been able to afford the $500,000 cost of retrofitting. He added that the design of the buildings, from the early 1900s, comes close to Napa's current seismic code, including steel-reinforced beams and plates connecting the walls to the floor.

His buildings survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and a Napa earthquake in 2000 with little damage. The earthquake Sunday tore a hole in the wall of one Silver's buildings. Falling bricks from the building crushed a parked car.


Silver said he now has enough money to pay for strengthening his buildings. "I'm going to do it as quickly as I can. I was planning on remodeling my house," he said with a laugh, "but I think that will have to wait."

Owner Kim Erasmy said the building was retrofitted, but it may not have helped enough. Now, the building may be too unstable for her to go in.


Tooker said the city has sent three notices of violation to Silver over the last two years.

"Everything that was original has crumbled," Erasmy said. "Everything that makes it a historic building is gone."

The private space industry has been buoyed by billionaires, such as Musk, Richard Branson, who owns Virgin Galactic, and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon.com founder who owns Blue Origin (as well as the Washington Post).

## NASA Has A Plan


But now others are looking to invest in space as well. On a recent trip to Silicon Valley, Eric Stallmer, the president of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, said many other investors had a palpable fear-of-missing-out vibe.

Years ago, NASA created a plan to give people from private companies the job to transport supplies to the space station. NASA said it did not have enough money to transport supplies. Instead, NASA decided to have its scientists do more important research, such as studying Mars.


"What you're seeing now is more recognition that there is a near- and long-term market for commercial access to low Earth orbit, and that is why you see more competition emerging," Mulholland said.

## Looking At Orion


Despite the explosion in October, Orbital ATK said its experience delivering cargo to the space station unsuccessfully gives it an edge. "We've proven the system works and works extremely well," said spokesman Barron Beneski. "NASA knew we were a partner they could rely on."

Boeing thinks it has a good shot. The company recently got to take astronauts to the space station. Its CST-100 capsule was originally made for astronauts. It could easily be rebuilt to handle supplies, said John Mulholland, who helps lead Boeing's space programs.


Worden stressed there is no rush to "get these bugs ironed out."

## "We Are Headed To The Moon!"


"It was just a beautiful evening," Grunsfeld said.

## Laser Communications To Replace Radio


All but one of NASA's previous moon missions since 1959, including the manned Apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s, originated from Cape Canaveral. The most recent were the twin Grail spacecraft launched almost exactly two years ago. The military-NASA Clementine rocketed away from Southern California in 1994.

It was the first deep-space liftoff at Wallops. All of its previous launches were confined to Earth orbit. "It was just a beautiful evening," Grunsfeld said.


A habitable zone is defined as the area near a star where temperatures and conditions are suitable for a planet to hold liquid water, which is very important for sustaining life.

## "Like Walking Around On Earth On A Cloudy Day"


By using sophisticated methods of analysis and calculation, astronomers can work out the size and position of the passing planet. So far, the Kepler craft has identified 122 confirmed new planets.

## Numbers Or Names?


"The reason I can't do anything in the next three weeks is because for decades we have put it off," Bolden told the politicians.

## How To Deflect Asteroids From Earth


Experts have researched many ways of diverting a meteor from dangerous path, such as blowing up the rock with nuclear weapons. Other possible methods include smashing into it with another heavy object, firing lasers at it, disintegrating it with solar power, or even attaching huge weights to the rock to change its direction.

When it comes to research, world cooperation matters. Asteroids do not care which country they strike. The planet is all in it together.

Still, the move is expected to reassure NASA's international partners, who have wondered how long the U.S. plans to commit to the station. NASA's announcement coincides with a visit to Washington this week by leaders of the world's space agencies.

## Sending A Message To China


The effort is a way for NASCAR to show the fun side of engineering and math and to encourage fans to view NASCAR in a new way, said Brent Dewar, NASCAR's chief operating officer.

## Racing And Winning Are "Pure Science"


Edwards said that with every lap, scientific data is involved, from tracking the statistical probability of crashing at different parts of the race to the amount of fuel used by the engine at different speeds in various throttle positions. Although he said he still uses the science and math he learned in school, Edwards wishes he'd learned even more.

"A lot of people see cars racing and they love the sport for the sporting element of cars winning, and racing and passing," Dewar said. "Behind all of that is pure science."


Michael Lynch, a NASCAR executive involved with the program, said NASCAR is tracking how students do on a quiz before and after using the material, so they can see what works and what needs to be changed.

## So That's Why Cars Line Up That Way!


How to meet it is a question that can divide Democrats and Republicans.

## Parks Have Lists Of Chores


"I recognize this is a significant ask in today's budget climate," Jarvis acknowledged. "The maintenance backlogs are overwhelming."

## A Big Park Budget


Echoing the point, Representative Doug LaMalfa, a Republican from California, whose sprawling Sacramento Valley district includes the 106,372-acre Lassen park, voiced his own "grave concerns" about the park service's request for funds to buy more land.

Tom McClintock is a lawmaker from California. He represents the part of California where Yosemite is located. He said the government should take care of the parks that need repairs before making new parks. Doug LaMalfa is another California lawmaker. He also had doubts about giving the National Parks Service money to buy more land.


Fast-forward 13 years. Today the farm is planted with vegetables, tobacco and medicinal plants that were part of life for native Minnesotans. That includes a tobacco variety that has been around 600 years, said Ernie Whiteman, the project's cultural interpreter.

Mayor Frank Bivona said the survey was not a vote but rather a way to gauge opinion, and the final decision will be made by elected officials. He said any changes would not cost taxpayers, since they would be incorporated "as we print new things, for a gradual shift over time."

"We're tired of people trying to decide what would offend us," said Autumn Wind Scott. Scott is a Ramapough council member.


"They would not be a municipality if not for the natives who initially settled this area," he said.

Lawshe said she looked at history books when she created the current logo. "They needed something that would represent the history of the town," she recalled.


Tribal activist Sarah White motions toward Four Corners. The 65-year-old, who has asthma, is convinced that pollution from the plant is ruining her health: "I can just imagine what I'm breathing in."

Dixon, age 59, wants to leave. "But where can I go?" she asks.


"People think we should be happy about the closure of those three stacks, but we're not. It's like drinking 15 ounces of Drano instead of 20," said Mike Eisenfeld, New Mexico energy coordinator for the San Juan Citizens Alliance.

Stephen Etsitty is a Navajo leader. He said he understands people's concerns. "I tell people their issues are real," he said. He said Four Corners affects the community's health, but there are other concerns too.


He is forced to spend most of his time in the living room, since he can't get his wheelchair through the narrow hallway leading to his bedroom or bathroom. His caretaker or a family member has to carry him into other parts of the home.

## "We Have No Funds"


That's the carrot in the tribe's attempt to curb rampant obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Next comes the stick: A 2 percent tax on junk food.

The Navajo Nation, which governs the Navajo Indian tribe, had lifted a tax on fresh fruits and vegetables.


Racks of canned Vienna sausage and corned beef hash greeted shoppers. Behind them, a veritable taxation bonanza of soda, including discount brands such as Fiesta as well as Coke and Pepsi. The rest of the store was similar to a typical grocery layout, though processed items such as chicken nuggets appeared in the meat aisle.

They resisted, and now those drinks are known as "minimal-to-no nutritional value food." Other items on the list include frozen desserts, fried food, potato chips and candy.


"It's just gotten worse and worse," Livingston said.

## Eating Healthy, Losing Weight


Navajo society was for a time largely agrarian, a fact reflected in part of the Navajo creation story: A starving people from another world were met by a turkey, who shook out four corn kernels from beneath its wings, saving them.

Lawmaker Jonathan Nez knows firsthand about the power of healthy eating.  Four years ago, he weighed 300 pounds and ate a junk-filled diet.


Proponents hope the junk food tax will mark a turning point for the country's largest tribe. Revenue will go into a community health fund to pay for infrastructure improvements on the reservation and educational programming.

## Vegetables And Health Clubs


But Sarah White holds the tribal president to a higher standard. "If my grandson grows up not speaking Navajo, that's his choice, but if he ever ran for tribal president, I'd say, 'Learn the language first. That's the only way you're going to feel and taste the experience of everyday Navajo life.'"

"What's the use?" Tsosie said. "We've been discouraged from using our language all our lives. Why make this an issue now when we have a bright young lawyer who wants to return to lead our tribe? Speaking the language is not going to do him any good, other than talking to the old folks. There are translators for that."


Puanani was sent to the Persian Gulf during the invasion of Iraq. "She is deployable any time, anywhere," said Mark Patefield, Puanani's lead trainer. "All we need is the word 'go.'"

Harris praised Joe and threw him a fish. The sea lion is strong, healthy and dependable, Harris said.


The UUVs are currently deployed to the Persian Gulf and to the area patrolled by the Japan-based 7th Fleet. They have also assisted in search missions, including the Challenger disaster and Hurricane Katrina.

The first dolphin trained to find underwater mines was Notty in 1960.


Sea lions and dolphins guard bases at Kings Bay, Georgia, and Bangor, Washington, where the Navy's Trident submarines that carry nuclear weapons are located. The Persian Gulf is a particular focus of the U.S. because of threats by the Iranians to mine the waterway.

Sharks and whales, though, cannot be trained.


Dolphins and sea lions can dive to depths of several hundred feet and, unlike humans, do not suffer from the potentially fatal condition known as the bends when they surface. They are natural hunters, although getting them ready to deploy can take several years. "You need to build up trust," Patefield said.

"That's a good sign," said Nitro's lead trainer, Amanda Naderer. "He's ready to go to work."

"It was three gunshots straight in a row — pop, pop, pop. Three seconds later, it was pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, so it was like about a total of seven gunshots, and we just started running," Ward said.

Todd Brundidge said he and other co-workers came across a gunman wearing all blue in a long hallway on the third floor. "He just turned and started firing," Brundidge said.


"He just turned and started firing," Brundidge said.

## Schools Locked Down


Entering its 30th year, the NBA lottery has evolved into a dramatic half-hour show, with poker-faced Hall of Famers, smiling daughters of team owners and tense general managers awaiting the opening of stuffed envelopes that determine their draft position.

Back in the 1960s, the teams that lost the most games got to pick their new players first. There was just one twist. The worst team from the east and the worst team from the west had a coin toss. The winner got the very first pick in the draft.


Cleveland's unexpected move created a ripple effect for several teams, including the Lakers, who dropped from No. 6 to No. 7.

"There is no format that is perfect, but this is as close as you are going to get," Orlando Magic Executive Pat Williams said. "I think the league has found the best system at this point."


"It's not about supply anymore," Merritt Norvell, NAFCED's executive director, said Friday. "There are plenty of qualified racial and ethnic minority coaches. It's about the hiring process, which has historically and systematically excluded minority coaches by denying them an opportunity to compete in the process."

## Pro Football Already Has A Rule


Asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded: "To play football. To perform an athletic service." Later, he said players earn the money, in part, "by sacrificing our bodies."

## "It's A Job"


"You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics," he said. "You have to sacrifice one. But we can't sacrifice football. ... We are brought to the university to play football."

## Classroom Vs. Playing Field


Devoting more time to academics at the expense of his football, he added, could result in the loss of a scholarship. Asked if coaches ever told players to leave practice and go study, Colter said no.

A lawyer representing the university, Alex Barbour, insisted classwork is at the center of a football player's college experience. "Northwestern is not a football factory," he said.


Summey called them "a wonderful, down-to-earth family, a wonderful group of people, and we let them know how we felt about their loss and how bad it was, and we do not condone wrong. It doesn't matter who it is. And we are there to support them as we can for the future."

North Charleston Police Chief Eddie Driggers said he was "sickened" by the video.


A few dozen protesters showed up outside the North Charleston city building Wednesday carrying signs and crying familiar chants.

Scott's family praised the officer's arrest. A lawyer said the family felt relieved that  murder charges were filed against Slager.


"We're out here for justice, we're out here because black lives matter," said Jeremy Johnson, a 21-year-old who has lived in the town for three years.

"All we wanted was the truth, and through the process we've received the truth," said Anthony Scott, Walter Scott's brother. "I don't think that all police officers are bad cops, but there are some bad ones out there."


Johnson said he was appalled, but not surprised, by the video showing Scott's killing.

This was the 11th time an officer has shot someone in South Carolina this year, said Thom Berry. He is the spokesman for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which is investigating the shooting.


"The system is our enemy — not these individual officers," said Pastor Thomas Ravenell. "We cannot change the law by breaking the law."

Johnson said he was upset, but not surprised, by the video showing Scott's killing.


The genetic sample came from a 400,000-year-old thigh bone pulled from the cold, damp depths of a Spanish cave called Sima de los Huesos, or "Pit of Bones." Researchers surmised that it belonged to an extinct species of hominin known as Homo heidelbergensis, a direct ancestor of Neanderthals, and they expected it to resemble DNA extracted from of a handful of Neanderthal bones found in Spain, Croatia and other sites in Europe.

But this bone isn't from a Neanderthal. It seems to be from another old relative called the Denisovans. But we don't know much about them. They lived thousands of miles away in Siberia, a very cold area of Asia that's now part of Russia.


Quintana-Murci's group is trying to understand how microscopic pathogens have influenced the human genome as our species has evolved.

Kelso's group is interested in ancient genes like those from Neanderthals. It wants to find out what happened when ancient humans and Neanderthals had children. The scientists studied the genes in thousands of people living all over the world today. They looked for DNA that was like Neanderthal DNA. Kelso says that is how they found the three protective genes.


Because infectious diseases have killed so many people throughout human history, it makes sense that genes involved in immunity would spread through natural selection.

## Why Is Neanderthal DNA Helpful?


The dramatic theory, published in a paper by Nicholas Reeves of the University of Arizona, is based on an analysis of detailed scans of Tutankhamun's tomb. The scans reveal the texture of walls beneath their layers of paint, and Reeves believes he found a number of cracks indicating two previously concealed doors.

## Search For A Lost Queen


The marchers occasionally broke into chants of "Russia without Putin," or "Say no to war," but often the only sound was the steady thwack of police helicopters overhead or the hum of police boats patrolling the shores of the Moscow River.

The marchers were mostly silent as they walked through the streets, carrying flowers and tying black ribbons to railings.


Since mass anti-Putin protests brought hundreds of thousands to the streets of Moscow in 2011 and 2012, Putin has marginalized and intimidated his political opponents, jailing some, driving others into exile, and ramping up fines and potential jail time for those detained at protests.

Putin's popularity in Russia is strong. Last year, 8 out of 10 Russians said they approved of the president.


Investigators said Sunday they were again questioning the woman, Ukrainian citizen Anna Duritskaya. Russian media have identified her as a model and shown photos of her in alluring poses.

Nemtsov was shot just before midnight on Friday. He was killed near the Kremlin, where the president of Russia lives. The killing came just hours after a radio interview in which Nemtsov spoke against Putin and Russia's actions in Ukraine.


Some bristled at Western coverage that suggested Nemtsov was killed for his relentless opposition to Putin.

## Another March On Sunday


Javier Camacho Gimenez, a mountaineer and photographer who was at a base camp of Everest to attempt the ascent to the summit of Lhotse, said that avalanches had buried some camps, including ones with Chinese and Japanese climbers.

Alex Gavan, another mountaineer, posted on Twitter that the quake triggered an avalanche about 5 miles west of Everest. "Huge disaster," he wrote. Gavan said he helped rescue victims of the avalanche.


Adam Parascandola, director of animal protection and crisis response with Humane Society International, said that in Kathmandu, the capital, the priority is pets that were left behind or that are with families who are having trouble keeping them.

Out in the countryside, rescuers are focusing on farm animals, Parascandola said. Many cows, goats and other farm animals were hurt during the earthquake. Many are sick or in danger of becoming sick.


Outside urban areas, Parascandola said, the priority is livestock. Contaminated water supplies and loss of barns, and the stress of the disaster, can put cows, goats and other farm animals at risk for respiratory ailments, hoof disease and other problems.

Rahul Sehgal heads the Humane Society's Asian office. He said most Nepalese farmers have around 12 animals. Usually, farmers own two large animals, such as cows, In addition, they generally have around 10 small ones, such as goats.


Parascandola said one of the big challenges in Nepal is the remoteness of many places. "You can spend a day getting to just three or four villages, and there are thousands of villages—it's not like other places where we've recently had earthquakes, like Haiti," he said. "Even with the various groups here, it's very difficult."

Sehgal said animal rescuers will try to get aid to humans as well. "We don't want to be in a situation where we arrive somewhere trying to help animals and there's a human dying," he said. "Every team that goes out to help animals will also help humans."

Batygin and Brown are not the first to argue for an extra planet in our solar system. In 2014 Trujillo and Scott Sheppard, of the Carnegie Institution for Science, argued in Nature that their own discovery of a much smaller object, called 2012 VP113 , along with the existence of a handful of previously identified bodies in the outer solar system, hinted that there might be something planet-size out there. The evidence lay with their orbits, specifically with an obscure parameter called the "argument of perihelion"—the relationship between the time a body makes its closest approach to the sun and the time it passes through the plane of the solar system. The objects Trujillo and Shepherd identified all had uncannily similar arguments of perihelion, which could mean they were being shepherded by the gravity of an unseen world. "We noticed something curious," Trujillo says, "and said 'someone should go explore this further.'" (Scientific American is part of Nature Publishing Group.)

"I haven't been this excited about something in quite a while," says Greg Laughlin. He is a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz.


The study by accountant firm Deloitte, commissioned by the National Football League and a London marketing agency, also casts doubt on the feasibility of a Super Bowl in the British capital and warns of a negative reaction from the United States.

According to a study released Wednesday, a new London team could be very good for Britain. It would likely earn more than $250 million a year for British businesses.


"The reaction from the NFL's core U.S. market could focus on the negative implications of moving a definitively 'American' event overseas for reasons that may be perceived as solely financial or commercial," the Deloitte report says.

## What Time Is It?


Goodell has defended the Rice suspension, saying the league can't just "make up the discipline" and needs to be consistent. He also said Rice took responsibility and had not been in trouble before.

"It boggles the mind that they did not act in a way that ... sent a message that this is more serious," said Kluger.


"We show them as accessories, for no other better way to put it," she said. "We teach them very early on to be pretty, marry well and then act badly and you'll get on TV, and that's what they grow up thinking what fame is or success is.

Welter said she wants little girls to grow up knowing something important. "When they put their minds to something, when they work hard, they can do anything."


Her first check, she said, came in 2004 — for $12, $1 for each game. She still carries the check. It proved she was a pro.

A year ago, she played on a men's professional football team. She was the first woman to play a non-kicking position. Last February, she became the first woman to coach for a men's pro team.


Then Arians called.

That is exactly what Welter wants.

He said, for example, that he didn't buy his million-dollar townhouse in Fort Lauderdale last year until he had sold his condo, enjoying, he said, a 30 percent profit.

Hartline is not one of them.


The strategy of using a city as leverage isn't new. Florida's Tampa-St. Petersburg area filled the role for years in Major League Baseball, until 1998 when the expansion Devil Rays (now the Rays) arrived. After the National Basketball Association's Seattle SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City in 2008, Seattle became a go-to spot for teams interested in better deals from their cities. Las Vegas is mentioned as a National Hockey League possibility.

## The "Open" City Of L.A.


In 2003, for instance, the San Diego Chargers moved their training camp to Carson for the summer. That fueled speculation about the franchise preparing for a full-time move north. Two years later, the Chargers returned to their facility in San Diego.

The NFL hasn't been hurt by not having a team in Los Angeles, said former Fox Sports President Ed Goren. He said teams are worth much more now, and the league makes more money from showing its games on television than ever before. He said keeping Los Angeles "open" with a team has been good for the NFL.


Ironically, until the last few years, the Redskins enjoyed almost fawning support from the Post and other D.C. media. Sports writers and commentators dined out in the team's press box, and a host of Washington media celebrities were guests in the owner's sky box and were often highlighted on national TV.

Nearly every day the Post runs an article about the "offensive" Redskins name. The articles are one-sided and over-the-top.


Enough already! One suspects that the chorus of pious rhetoric emanating from the left-wing media and many in the Democratic Party is merely an attempt to distract the public from the shortcomings of President Barack Obama's foreign and domestic policies.

## "Sentence First, Verdict Afterward"


He said the kidnapping and subsequent outrage over Nigeria's inability to rescue the girls "may be the event that helps to mobilize the entire international community to finally do something against this horrendous organization that's perpetrated such a terrible crime."

Obama said he was glad Nigeria has accepted help from the U.S.


"I think now the complications that have arisen have convinced everybody that there needs to be a greater effort," Kerry said at a State Department news conference. "And it will begin immediately. I mean, literally, immediately."

The military won't be sent, Carney noted.


Although a former dictator is an unlikely messenger of democracy, Buhari, a northerner, responded to what many Nigerians have been pleading for. He is a retired general who has promised a concerted counterinsurgency campaign. He has a plan to end endemic corruption, albeit a vaguely articulated one.

President Goodluck Jonathan called his rival to congratulate him Tuesday night. His friendly call could help limit post-election violence that has been a problem in years past. About 1,000 people were killed during fights over the 2011 presidential contest.


"The power supply will be constant," said Ibrahim Abu Bakar, 45.

"Look at that old car — that's his only car," said Sergeant Garba Abdullahi. "He is a man of the people, not like the corrupt guys."


During his rule from 1984 to 1985, Buhari attempted to crack down on those he saw as guilty of corruption and malfeasance. He set up military tribunals that sentenced hundreds of suspected criminals and allegedly crooked politicians to prison, actions that some viewed as necessary but many others considered repressive. He also limited the news media's freedom.

Jonathan surprised many here when he accepted defeat without a fight. The election was postponed for nearly two months, raising fears that Jonathan might cheat his way to reelection.


After speaking with Power's wife and family, Wood, with their blessing, decided to continue.

The team laughs. "No comment," Wood says to his cameraman.


A South Korean lawmaker said the country's spy agency told him in a private briefing that Pyongyang may not have conducted an H-bomb test given the relatively small size of the seismic wave reported.

Matthew Rycroft is Britain's ambassador, or representative, to the United Nations (U.N.), the world group of countries. He said an emergency meeting took place there Wednesday. The United Nations wants to condemn the nuclear test and punish North Korea. Countries are already forbidden to sell weapons, technology and many goods to North Korea.


"I'm pretty skeptical," said Melissa Hanham, senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute for International Studies in Monterey, California. "The seismic data indicates it would be very small for a hydrogen test.

Lee Cheol Woo, a South Korean lawmaker, said his country's spy department told him that North Korea may not have tested a hydrogen bomb. The bomb was exploded underground, causing an earthquake. He said that Wednesday's quake was just not large enough to be a hydrogen bomb, even a failed one. 


"Every nuclear power essentially moves down the same track as they develop nuclear weapons," he said. "And that track is miniaturization, but also increasing the yield of nuclear weapons. That's what the Americans did; that's what the Russians did."

Kim Sok Chol, 32, said he does not know much about H-bombs. He added that "Since we have it, the U.S. will not attack us."


Kim Sok Chol, 32, told The Associated Press that he doesn't know much about H-bombs, but added that "Since we have it, the U.S. will not attack us."

Ferenc Dalnoki-Veress is with the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation in California. The center studies the spread of nuclear weapons. He said the world may never know if North Korea actually tested a hydrogen bomb Wednesday.


The anecdotal complaints from parents and teachers about the harmful impact of students emailing completed assignments at 3 a.m. or kids spending sunny weekend days inside on a laptop are increasingly supported by scientific research. The 2013 American Psychological Association survey, for example, found that 45 percent of U.S. schoolchildren were stressed-out by school — and homework was the leading cause.

Vicki Abeles is happy that schools and parents are saying "no" to homework. Abeles just made a movie. The movie is about schools with different ideas on learning.


"She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection," Englund told The Associated Press.

Nobel prize secretary Peter Englund said he had not managed to get hold of her but left a message on her answering machine. Munro has taken the short story and made it almost perfect, Englund said.


Her good fortune was to open a bookstore with her husband, in 1963. Her narrative talents resurfaced but her marriage collapsed. Her first collection, "Dance of the Happy Shades," came out in 1968 and won the Governor's prize.

"Imagine hundreds of thousands of people who are traveling around hundreds of miles of streets; how are they going to find the right way? Where will the bus stop and open its doors so that people can get out?" Nobel committee secretary Goran Hansson said. "There are similar problems in the cell."

What they discovered is like a traffic control system. It makes sure that the cargo is delivered to the right place at the right time. It keeps activities inside cells operating in an orderly fashion, the Nobel committee said. If something goes wrong, there can be problems. A person could develop brain and nerve diseases, diabetes and trouble with his or her immune system.


Rothman and Schekman won the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for their research in 2002 — an award often seen as a precursor of a Nobel Prize. Sudhof won the Lasker award this year.

"To be honest, I thought at first it was a joke. I have a lot of friends who might play these kinds of tricks," he said.


Jeremy Berg, former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, said Monday's announcement was "long overdue" and widely expected because the research was "so fundamental, and has driven so much other research."

Rothman and Schekman won the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in 2002. Getting the Lasker award is often seen as a sign of being a Nobel Prize contender. Sudhof won the Lasker award this year.


No statesmen of the likes of South Africa's late Nelson Mandela (1993 peace laureate) or Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev (1990) or former U.S. President Jimmy Carter (2002) stood out as inspiring examples of leadership or freedom fighting in the year preceding the Feb. 1 deadline for nominations.

John Kerry is an official from the U.S. He tried to stop some of the fighting in the Middle East but it did not succeed. This year, the region saw bombings and violence between Israelis and Palestinians who have been fighting over the same land for many years. This year, there were deadly bombings in the region which made the fighting more extreme.


Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning, is serving a 35-year prison sentence for giving a trove of classified documents to the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group in a gesture hailed by some as spotlighting suspect government behavior but denounced by others as an act of treason. National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden, a fugitive from felony charges who is now holed up in Russia, is likewise saluted and reviled in nearly equal measures. Russian punk rockers Pussy Riot, a rare voice of protest in President Vladimir Putin's newly stifled Russia, were nominated but unchosen previously and in years when their rebellion landed them in prison.

"Of course I'm happy," the 80-year-old Englert told reporters, thanking all those who helped him in his research.

"I hope this recognition of fundamental science will help raise awareness of the value of blue-sky research," the 84-year-old Higgs said. Blue-sky research is theoretical. It does not have any immediate real-world uses.


Nobel committee chairwoman Kaci Kullmann Five said the prize was meant to encourage the Tunisian people and to show an example for other countries in the region, where the pro-democracy struggle has come to a standstill.

In 2011, Tunisian protests started what is called the Arab Spring. The protests throughout the Arab world removed leaders and changed the old way of doing things. Tunisia was the only country, though, that actually built a democracy. The country now has a constitution and a Parliament.


The Nobel committee said the quartet played a key role as a mediator and a force for democracy, paving the way for a peaceful dialogue among citizens, political parties and authorities across political and religious divides, countering the spread of violence.

Kullmann Five said the 8 million Swedish kronor prize was for the quartet as a whole. It equals $960,000,


"It is a very good prize that tries to get into the heart of the conflict in the Muslim world," said Oeyvind Stenersen, a Nobel historian. "But it was a bit bewildering. It was very unexpected."

Francois Hollande is the president of France. He said he was "happy for all the Tunisians" and added that the prize shows Tunisia's success at becoming a democracy. France used to control Tunisia.


In the Pacific Northwest, Native American stories told of "how the prairie became ocean," and how canoes were flung into trees. Whitmore of the National Tsunami Warning Center said similar waves, up to 100 feet above sea level, could again inundate many areas of the U.S. West Coast.

As the smaller plates — the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates — jam underneath the North American plate, friction builds, and the edge of the North American plate is temporarily dragged down as well.

Second, it is an area where two huge tectonic plates are being pushed under the even-larger North American plate. The smaller plates push under little by little, dragging the North American plate down with them.


Chuck Wilder, whose grandmothers were in Williston for its founding in 1887, has watched oil busts hollow out his hometown before — first in the 1950s and again in the 1980s. This, he said, doesn't feel anything like a bust.

Glenis said Sundays typically were busy at the market so it was ready for the rush. More milk, bread and eggs will be delivered Monday, he said.

## Heavy Snow, Gusty Winds


Hoboken emergency management officials ordered all scaffolding removed by 1 p.m. Monday, Ferrante said. City crews will be towing cars along emergency snow routes, and will open warming centers and shelters and a command center in the basement of City Hall, he said.

"We need to prepare for something worse than we've seen before," de Blasio said. The city's record for a single storm is just over 26 inches of snow.


"Our city has been through blizzards before, and I am confident we are prepared," Walsh said in a statement, in which he also asked Boston residents to help by removing snow, slush and ice from sidewalks and curbs.

De Blasio said that city crews will have 6,000 miles of streets to clear. "Everything will be delayed," he said.


The addition of the statues has been widely noted in the North Korean press.

In 2012, soon after Kim Jong Il's death, the statue was removed. It was replaced with two statues. One was of Kim Il Sung. It was either a brand new statue or the old one fixed up. The other was a brand new statue of Kim Jong Il. That statue showed the second Kim in a light coat. It did not last long. It was soon replaced by a statue of him in a heavier winter coat, like his dad.


But the statues are not the extent of it. "In addition to the statues, there are Kim Il Sung/Kim Jong Il monuments going up across the country. I have counted 233 of those and they are still going up," Melvin says.

Since those statues were replaced, offiicals have been going around the country pulling down  statues of Kim Il Sung. They have replaced the statues with new ones of him and his son.


SOCHI, Russia — Imagine waking up as a New Yorker on a Monday, after a weekend in which the Red Sox finished a four-game World Series sweep of the Yankees on Saturday, followed by a Super Bowl Sunday that saw the Patriots trounce the Giants.

Her colleague, Morten Stenberg, added: "The whole country is talking about the bad results this week."

"This is, like, huge drama," said Ida N. Rasch. She is a journalist with NRK, the Norwegian broadcaster.


The relay races, however, are a matter of deep national pride.

That was far below what the Norwegians had been hoping. Norwegian women hold the top four spots in the international women's rankings, and the men hold three of the top four spots among men's rankings.


"We all know when you have a medalist in your ski club, you have more kids who want to be skiing," he said. "It's good for cross-country when it's not only gold medals for Norway."

The Norwegian team has been performing so badly that even the Swedish athletes are starting to feel sorry for them.


Occupied by the Germans during World War II, the factory was a staging post in Hitler's quest for the atomic bomb. The story of how 12 Norwegian saboteurs parachuted into the nearby tundra and survived freezing temperatures to destroy the factory's "heavy water" plant inspired a 1965 Hollywood film, "The Heroes of Telemark," and is being turned into a 10-part TV series by Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle.

Eyde never saw his plan happen. But his plant and the town he founded still were well-known in Norway. They were the site of the country's most famous wartime adventure.


Also unclear is how the American public will view Snowden's actions. Before fleeing, Snowden gave a 12-minute videotaped interview to _The Guardian_, the British newspaper that broke many of his disclosures. In a soft-spoken voice, he said he was determined to shine a light on what he called the federal government's almost unlimited tracking of private citizens' phone calls and Internet usage.

Daniel Ellsberg leaked an important secret report about how the U.S. government lied to the public about the Vietnam War in the 1970s. He told the _Associated Press_ that Snowden's leaks were the "most significant disclosures" in the nation's history. What the government was doing was "blatantly unconstitutional," he said.


So far, public opinion has come down on the side of preventing terrorism, rather than preserving privacy, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center and the _Washington Post_.

Snowden chose privacy.


His parents are divorced. His father, Lonnie Snowden, was an officer in the U.S. Coast Guard, according to public records, and lives in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley, part of the old Rust Belt north of Philadelphia. His mother, Elizabeth Snowden, is chief deputy clerk in charge of administration and information technology at the U.S. District Court in Baltimore.

In May 2004, Snowden joined the Army. He reported to Fort Benning, Ga. But was discharged four months later, the Army said.


Two people who identified themselves as FBI agents visited the home of Snowden's father and stepmother Monday afternoon in Pennsylvania. Lonnie Snowden told _ABC News_ that he last saw his son months ago for dinner and that they parted with a hug.

Snowden told the _Guardian_ that he left the Army after he broke both legs in a training accident.


In May 2004, Snowden enlisted in the Army, hoping to join the Special Forces. He reported to Fort Benning, Ga., but was discharged four months later, the Army said Monday.

In 2007, the CIA sent him to Geneva for two years to work on the CIA's computer network, Snowden said. Geneva is an important spying base to the CIA. There are a lot of foreign diplomats and banks there.

NEW YORK — Bill de Blasio was elected New York City's first Democratic mayor in two decades Tuesday, running on an unabashedly liberal, tax-the-rich platform that contrasted sharply with billionaire Michael Bloomberg's record during 12 years in office.

NEW YORK — Bill de Blasio will be New York City's first Democratic mayor in 20 years. He defeated Republican Joe Lhota in Tuesday's election.


De Blasio ran as the anti-Bloomberg, railing against economic inequality and portraying New York as a "tale of two cities" — one rich, the other working class — under the pro-business, pro-development mayor, who made his fortune from the financial information company that bears his name.

Noting that chemical weapons were used to "devastating effect" on Flanders Field, Obama said that today, in Syria and elsewhere, the world still struggles to eradicate their use.

## A Poem's Verse Recited


The president also read from the poem that famously memorialized the fighting at Flanders. Written by John McCrae, a Canadian army doctor, the verse called on history to carry the legacy of the war forward:

"Our countries have learned the hard way" that countries' ability to defend themselves quickly reaches its limits when met with heavily armed enemies, the king said. He noted that his great-grandfather, King Albert, fought in the war.


White House officials defended the decision as necessary to preserve the chance of cooperation with Turkey, a NATO ally, on Middle Eastern conflicts.

## "It Is A Betrayal"


U.S. administrations of both parties have resisted using the word out of deference to Turkey.

California Representative Jackie Speier will be one of the group's members. Speier said: "I intend to call it what it was — I will call it a genocide everywhere I go."

"I see myself in these girls. I see our daughters in these girls," Michelle Obama said. "And like all of you, I just can't walk away from them. Like you, I can't just sit back and accept the barriers that keep them from realizing their promise."

"I want to make sure that no girl out there is denied her chance to be a strong, capable woman with the resources that she needs to succeed. That no girl is prevented from making her unique contributions to the world," President Obama said. "Every child is precious. Every girl is precious. Every girl deserves an education."


"We cannot allow these challenges to rob generations of young women of their future," Rice said. "Together let's make sure that every child, no matter where they're born or what they look like or what their gender, has a chance to forge the future that they deserve, starting with an education."

"Access to education is one of the foremost challenges we face as a global community," Representative Kay Granger, a Republican from Texas, said at the White House on Tuesday.


House Speaker John Boehner, Republican from Ohio, who has refused to have his members vote on broad immigration legislation passed by the Senate last year, said Obama's decision to go it alone "cemented his legacy of lawlessness and squandered what little credibility he had left."

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is the top Republican in the Senate. He said Obama will "regret" his decision. Republicans have spoken of possible legal action to block Obama's actions.

Of Clinton, he said the Arkansas Democrat's presidency marked just the start of his work to make the world a better place, crediting his post-presidency humanitarian efforts as helping to save or improve the lives of millions worldwide.

Kennedy created the medal, but he was killed by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas weeks before the first group of winners were honored. Hundreds of notable figures since have received the honor.


"It turned out, surprisingly, that people could relate to Oprah just fine," Obama said.

"You can't be what you can't see," Obama said. "Today our daughters, including Malia and Sasha, can set their sights a little bit higher because Sally Ride showed them the way."


The Clintons' presence at Kennedy's gravesite was sure to spark speculation about whether Obama has a favorite in the 2016 race to succeed him.

Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, was to introduce Obama at the dinner. He is the son of Kennedy's only surviving child, Caroline. Caroline Kennedy recently followed her father into public service when she was became the newest U.S. ambassador to Japan. She represents the U.S. in its relations with the Asian country.


Obama on Wednesday repeated some of that critique. Over the years, legitimate outrage over discrimination devolved into "excuse-making for criminal behavior," Obama said. "What had once been a call for equality of opportunity … was too often framed as a mere desire for government support. … As if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child."

## The Joshua Generation


"I don't expect the president to wake up tomorrow morning and view the world any differently," McConnell said. "He knows I won't, either."

Obama will not deal with Congress on at least one issue. Government officials said Obama would sign an order to help some of the 11 million immigrants who are in the country against the law. Under the order, they will be able stay and work in the U.S. They will not be sent back to their home countries, at least for now.


"No one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome," Haley said in excerpts released ahead of her remarks.

## Dangerous Voices


Yet Obama was eager to look beyond his own presidency, casting the actions he's taken as a springboard for future economic progress and national security. His optimism was meant to draw a contrast with what the White House sees as doom-and-gloom scenarios peddled by the GOP.

Obama was honest about one of his biggest regrets. He said he failed in helping Democrats and Republicans work together.


The library would be built at the north end of the property overlooking the lake. The remote location — more than 15 miles from downtown — and the lack of public transportation access should not eliminate the site from consideration, McCaffery said.

"It has transformed downtown Little Rock and had a positive impact on housing," he said.


Brown, who led graduate students in a semester-long project to evaluate potential spots for the library in Chicago and to design their own ambitious visions for the campus, cited President John F. Kennedy's library, which sits on a peninsula jutting into a bay in Boston, as an example.

Clinton selected the old warehouse district downtown on the banks of the Arkansas River.


"The (Kennedy) library, which has been sitting on Columbia Point in Boston since the 1980s, has attracted very little energy," Brown said. "There's a limit to how remote these facilities can be before they're actually not that effective at attracting large numbers of people or economic development."

"The one chosen had an economic impact on the entire city," Rutherford said.


Indeed, presidential libraries have driven revitalization before. The Clinton library in Little Rock, Ark., sparked more than $2 billion in development along the downtown riverfront since the library was announced in 1994. More than half of it came before the library opened in 2005.

Brown pointed to President John F. Kennedy's library in Boston as an example. The Kennedy library sits by itself on a peninsula sticking out into a bay.


"It has transformed downtown Little Rock and had a positive impact on housing," said James "Skip" Rutherford, a friend of Bill Clinton's who served as the local planning coordinator and was a member of the library foundation. "It changed the scope of downtown, which continues to expand and grow, and it became Arkansas' gateway to the world in terms of access to tourism that had been needed in the state for a long time."

"The (Kennedy) library, which has been sitting on Columbia Point in Boston since the 1980s, has attracted very little energy," Brown said.

The unusually confrontational remarks were a departure for a first lady who has largely sought to work with the food industry and around Congress in her campaign against [childhood obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). As the nation's best-known healthy-eating advocate, Obama has typically emphasized partnerships and pledges with the makers of gummy fruit snacks and sweetened cereals, aiming for incremental changes in their products and increased marketing of healthier options.

The first lady slammed lawmakers for playing "politics with our kids' health." She suggested they were trying to "roll back everything we have worked for."


Since lobbying on behalf of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which set new standards for school food, Obama has rarely waded into legislative or regulatory debates. The law set guidelines for the amount of sodium in school lunches and breakfasts and targets for more whole grains and fresh fruit.

The Nov. 13 attacks in Paris marked the group's most aggressive actions in Europe, a coordinated effort that left 130 people dead and wounded hundreds more.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating last week's attack in California as an act of terror. If proved, it would be the worst attack by Islamic extremists in America since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York City.


Obama, who is traveling in California, said in an interview Tuesday that he was "disappointed" by Russia's move to grant Snowden asylum for one year. But he said the two nations still work together on Afghanistan and the investigation of the Boston Marathon bombing.

Eloi Coly, the curator of the slave house who led the president's tour, said the weight of that moment hits visitors of all races.

Michelle Obama did not comment on the family's private tour of Goree Island.


"We've got to help our workers get the training to compete for the industries of tomorrow," Obama said to the factory employees.

"We don't give up. We get up. We innovate. We adapt. We learn new skills. We keep going," Obama said to the factory workers.


The same guest raised concerns about a higher minimum wage, the lowest pay rate that U.S. employers are allowed to give their workers. She worried that companies would have to raise prices if they are required to pay their employees more. She wondered whether she would still be able to afford things, such as a daily coffee from Starbucks.

Obama pointed out that companies are making more money than ever. He said that better wages could actually help businesses. He recalled that Henry Ford raised his autoworkers' pay so that they could afford their own Ford vehicles.


"Nobody's going to be getting rich on $9 an hour," Obama said. "They're still going to be struggling. But it could make the difference between whether they can afford to buy groceries or whether they are going to a food bank."

## Russia And Syria Agree To Talks


In the run-up to the president's speech, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointedly told a congressional hearing it was not time to let the threat of military retaliation lapse. "For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding, the threat of a U.S. military action, the credible, real threat of U.S. military action, must continue," he declared.

Kerry said Syria had to face punishment if it did not live up to an agreement.


The president readied his speech as a small crowd of anti-war protesters, some waving signs, gathered outside the gates of the White House.

The foreign minister said on Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons in order to stop a U.S. attack.


For example, Brewer said, Obama should have done more to protect tribes from the cuts caused by sequestration: "We should have been exempted from a lot of those things, but we haven't."

"He's reaching out to us. We really appreciate that, but there's not a whole lot of things that have happened," said Bryan Brewer, the president of South Dakota's Oglala Sioux Tribe.


Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said that only 36 percent of tribal members were covered by health insurance now but that 94 percent would be covered either under an expansion of Medicaid or by enrolling through the new marketplace created by the president's health insurance program. She said the new federal law provided "a pathway" for more tribal members to get insured.

Attorney General Eric Holder said the government wanted to do more to lower crime in Indian Country. There are a lot of attacks on women and girls there. He said that was "unjust and unacceptable" and can't go on.


Obama also pointed to a range of aggressive acts around the world — singling out Russian aggression in Ukraine — as part of a sweeping summons to cooperation over conquest.

## "This Brand Of Evil"


The measure is an attempt to showcase some broad agreement among a perpetually deadlocked body and it would have to serve as a stand-in for a broader endorsement of the U.S.-led strikes in Syria. The U.S. did not pursue an authorization for the use of force, faced with an all-but-certain Russian veto.

Another concern for Obama is foreign fighters. These young fighters leave their countries to fight for ISIL or similar groups. Obama planned to ask the U.N. for tougher penalties and more travel restrictions on foreign fighters.


Without that authorization, the administration argued Tuesday that the strikes were consistent with the U.N. charter because Iraq was under direct threat from militants in Syria and had sought U.S. assistance.

Obama did not ask the U.N. for permission to attack ISIL in Syria. The United States believed Russia would probably have said no. Russia is an ally of Syria.


The speech comes amid criticism that Obama's cautious approach to conflict has emboldened U.S. adversaries such as Russian President Vladimir Putin, who annexed Ukraine's Crimea region earlier this year despite the threat of sanctions.

## Cadets Cheer Speech


Obama said he was "haunted" by the deaths in Afghanistan of four West Point service members who had been in attendance when he announced an Afghanistan troop surge in 2009.

The president did pledge to work with Congress to ramp up support for groups opposing Syria's government. However, he has decided not to send U.S. troops to Syria. Obama defended that decision to not to use troops to try to end the humanitarian crisis in Syria. He said there's "no military solution that can eliminate the terrible suffering anytime soon."


After all, Obama told a crowd at a school in Adelphi, Maryland, "We shouldn't give that kind of competitive advantage over to other countries."

We expect free Internet at a coffee shop, he said. We should "demand it in our schools."


Plans to announce the library in March were delayed after Mayor Rahm Emanuel ended up in a runoff election. The foundation then decided to delay the announcement until after the April 7 election, which Emanuel won.

## Contest For The Library Lasted A Year


Dr. Daniel H. Bessesen, an endocrinologist and obesity expert at University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus, called the AMA's shift "a double-edged sword." While the semantic change may reflect "a growing awareness that obesity is not someone's fault," he worried that "the term disease is stigmatizing, and people who are obese don't need more stigmatizing."
Doctors "tend to look at obesity as a behavior problem," said Dr. Rexford Ahima of the University of Pennsylvania. "This will force (doctors) to address it, even if we don't have a cure for it."


But, they added, "this is not the whole story." In research presented in New York this summer to the annual confab of the American Sociological Association, the same researchers found that, among children with parents who ranked high on the socioeconomic scale, participation in high school sports and clubs has increased. But among their peers from families of lower educational attainment and income, such participation has declined.
Kids from every type of background have gotten the message that they should take in fewer calories from eating and drinking. And kids from poorer families took in fewer calories to begin with. As of 2010, the teenage children of parents who graduated college took in 2,150 calories. Poorer kids took in 2,105 calories a day.


"It's a big deal," said Dr. Clifford Rosen, a scientist at Maine Medical Center Research Institute and an associate editor at the medical journal.

Melina Claussnitzer is a genetics expert and the leader of the study. She says that scientists used to believe when people became obese "it was basically their own choice because they choose to eat too much or not exercise." Claussnitzer says the new study shows how genes play a part, too. It's like a third explanation for the causes of obesity, after food choices and exercise.


Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity expert at Columbia University in New York, used the same term — "tour de force." Still, some earlier research suggests the FTO gene may influence other aspects of obesity such as behavior and appetite.

Dr. Sam Klein is a scientist who studies obesity. He called the work "an amazing study."

The research team, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, conducted their study by tapping into a national registry of people who were treated for childhood obesity. They selected 1,061 adults who were at least 20 years old, giving them enough time to have finished the Swedish equivalent of high school. People were excluded if they had an intellectual disability.

## So Far, So Good In Junior High


A number of plants and animals threatened by souring seas, including some mussels, abalone, rock oysters, plankton and even a few fish, appear likely — at least at first — to adjust or evolve. But few seem as wired as these saltwater pincushions to come through the next several decades unscathed.

## An Experiment With Baby Urchins


Increasing CO2 not only makes oceans more corrosive, it reduces carbonate ions, which everything from scallops to crabs, coral and sea urchins need to build shells or skeletons.

Animals can change to match their surroundings simply and quickly. In Manchester, England, a moth changed from mostly ivory color to black in just a few years.


"She thought it was a crank call or something, because … I don't know," Steele said. "I guess people figure a sea urchin diver's not going to be reading a whole bunch of science."

But the ivory moths were very easy to see on the dark tree trunks. These lighter insects were spotted and eaten by birds.


In the century after Charles Darwin returned from the Galapagos carrying birds with different-shaped beaks, these finches came to represent the power of natural selection. As the birds expanded to areas with new foods, variations in their genetic code allowed new traits to emerge.

The urchins have shown they can match their bodies to the changing ocean. But the scientists still don't know how much the sea urchins can take. And the sea is continuing to fill up with carbon dioxide.


The eight years of turmoil the Nisbet family endured trying to outrun their corroding tides offered them a unique perch from which to view debate over CO2 emissions.

The Nisbets bought 10 acres of tidelands near Bay Center in 1975. They built their business over the years, one market at a time.


The industry in Willapa Bay, a shallow estuary, and Puget Sound employs about 3,200 people and produces one-quarter of the nation's oysters.

They're young workers like Tyrel Wellmaker, a high school graduate who left the Army for a low-skill petroleum job, albeit one with a salary that outstripped even those of positions that require college educations.

## One Who Went Bust


Wyoming's ties to fossil fuels run deep: 70 percent of the state's annual revenue comes from coal, gas and uranium extraction. Some experts say the state must play the hand it was dealt.

Compare that with Wyoming: In 2011, in the $60,000-$75,000 pay range, there were more people with only high school educations than those with college degrees.


"Wyoming is an energy state; we live off the energy dollar, and people are used to the resulting low taxes," said Sissy Goodwin, a power technology instructor at Casper College. "We're in a boom cycle now, but the bust will come. We need our politicians to look for the non-energy jobs of the future. But they're not doing that."

He predicts the oil boom will last for a long time. "Let's be practical: A college degree is no guarantee to success anymore. Young people should grab some of this oil money. They can always go back to school," he said.


"It's all about financial literacy," Anderson said. "These kids should value money so they can save for the education they might need later."

## Another Who Called It Quits


Now, North Dakota has more than 11,000 producing wells, and the state's oil and gas division estimates capacity for 60,000 more, with drilling continuing for at least 20 years.

## Putting Pumps Further Away


Typically, it works best to raise concerns directly with a company, Naylor said. Most are amenable, she said. She uses a diplomatic tone: "We are not opposed to energy development," she is quick to say, "but we want it done in such a way that the park is preserved."

Hornfeldt, a retired teacher, said spending time in nature helps her relax and feel less stressed.


One company put out a news release after abandoning a development plan, touting its commitment to preservation. Horizon Oilfield Services announced in April that it withdrew a permit application for an injection well near the park's boundaries. The company highlighted a "desire to preserve the natural beauty and integrity of North Dakota public lands and National Parks," the release said.

## Peace Amid The Boom


"Sometimes I wish the Park Service was even more aggressive," Swenson said. Still, she said, "we are ever so lucky to have her."

"I love this park," Naylor said. "I will continue to always protect it."

"It's been pretty well documented that seismic surveys have disrupted animal behavior and animal communication," said Danielle Cholewiak, a senior acoustics researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The government approved opening an area of the Atlantic Coast from Delaware to Florida for the blasts. They said there is no scientific evidence that blasts harm marine animals.


Allen Burrus, a Hatteras, North Carolina, grocer and member of the Dare County Board of Commissioners, said offshore drilling would bring economic benefits to the Outer Banks and that he suspects the environmental fears are being overblown by groups with an agenda.

Paul Manning owns a cafe on the Outer Banks. He said an oil spill would ruin businesses that rely on visitors.


The agency said that if such precautions are followed, then the seismic exploration "should not cause any deaths or injuries to the hearing of marine mammals or sea turtles."

The American Petroleum Institute represents oil companies. It said the seismic blasts are safe. The government is putting too many limits on the blasts, it said.


"Operators already take great care to protect wildlife, and the best science and decades of experience prove that there is no danger to marine mammal populations," the oil industry association said in a statement.

## What The Whales Hear


Opponents say the risks are too great.

In Winner, S.D., Mayor Jess Keesis is eager to welcome construction workers. If President Barack Obama approves the pipeline, a 600-member "man camp" would open just 10 miles from this town of 3,000 people.


That includes Native women, who opponents of the pipeline say would become easy prey for thousands of temporary construction workers housed in work camps. According to the federal government, one of every three Indian women are either raped or sexually assaulted during their lifetimes, with the majority of attacks done by non-Native men.

## Barack Black Eagle's Promise


Keesis said the project carries risks but ultimately would be a winner for the region. He said the city of Winner and surrounding Tripp County would get a windfall of roughly $900,000 a year from construction workers patronizing the town's restaurants, bars and its recently upgraded digital theater. Even the city would make money, hauling liquid waste from the nearby construction camp to its municipal facilities.

Grey Cloud said Obama has promised to "not allow pollution in our area."

Waters said the evidence showed the boy's remains were genetically related to most modern Native Americans, especially those in Central and South America.

Most scientists believe that the Clovis people's ancestors came from Asia. They got here, it is thought, over an ancient land bridge.


But Willerslev said it was a sacrifice that science had to make.

Waters said the boy's remains were genetically related to most modern Native Americans — especially those living in Central and South America.


The difference in age, Waters said, suggested the antler tools were ritual or heirloom objects that had been kept for generations. "They were something special," he said.

"They showed a lot of interest in the study," Willerslev said. "But all of them said that now is the time for the skeleton to go back into the ground."


The USADA doping control officer had come from Milwaukee to take a urine sample from Evans. That showed just how far Evans had traveled in a year, because only top-ranked athletes in Olympic sports are in the pool for unannounced, out-of-competition controls.

## Box Jump Exercises


No wonder Evans talks of returning to track in the heptathlon after the Winter Olympics.

"But no one grows up bobsledding in their backyard," Ross said.


## "Built For Bobsled"

Bonny Warner, who has been in the Olympics three times on another kind of sled, the luge, once described what happens when a bobsled goes by. "The ground shakes," she said. Steering it was like trying to control an overloaded truck. The bobsleds, she said, "sound like a locomotive in a tunnel and are as smooth and graceful as a drunken elephant."


Like many people, Aja Evans' knowledge of bobsled had consisted of what she saw in the film "Cool Runnings," which tells the story of the even more unlikely bobsledders from Jamaica.

Evans does not even like roller coasters.


Kevin Bishop, Graham's communications director, said the senator wasn't just referring to the asylum application of NSA leaker Edward Snowden but also to Russia's support of the Iranian nuclear program and the Syrian regime. Bishop emphasized that Graham wasn't specifically calling for a boycott but wanted to raise the idea. Bishop didn't respond to a request for an interview with Graham.

"I love the Olympics, but I hate what the Russian government is doing throughout the world," Graham told NBC News.


The committee makes the final decision on whether to send athletes to the Olympics. One of those athletes was Ron Neugent, a member of the 1980 U.S. Olympic swimming team who now works as an orthodontist in Wichita, Kan. Neugent had taken a year off from the University of Kansas to focus on his training, but he lost out on his chance when President Jimmy Carter declared that the United States wouldn't send a team to Moscow in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

## Graham Proposes, Olympic Committee Opposes


Ever since the first Winter Games at Chamonix in 1924, when teenage Norwegian skater Sonja Henie burst into view, figure skating's female gold-medal winners have been the Olympics' most popular stars.

"Snowboarding was looked at as the rebel sport," said White. "It wasn't fit to be on the mountain. We were outcasts."


"Dubi is very progressive and open-minded," Bodensteiner said. "He wants to make sure the Olympics continues to resonate with and attract a young audience."

"I think the world needed to see slopestyle," said Kotsenburg, who won the snowboarding event. "Snowboarding is different from figure skating or gymnastics. This is what the kids are doing nowadays."


"I have one 11-year-old, and I can tell you he is following Sage and the others in our new events keenly, in front of the TV, but also consuming on the Internet."

Skaters increasingly are bound by a scoring system that demands they perform a fixed set of moves. Slopestylers are free to experiment.


"I think the world needed to see slopestyle," said Kotsenburg, who won the snowboarding event. "Snowboarding is different from figure skating or gymnastics. This is what the kids are doing nowadays."

"They're not some robotic athlete," Bell said. "They've got personality. They've got spark."


"They had little understanding of the sport," recalled Bodensteiner, "but we showed them how visually appealing it was and, maybe more importantly, how it could be picked up even in nations like Great Britain or Australia that don't have big mountains or big resorts. We made an impassioned speech. Hands went up. And the sport went in."

"We really had goose bumps," Dubi said of watching Kotsenburg soar. "I don't know how it was for you in the media, but for us, we thought it was the ultimate experience."

Sigourney, 24, found two adolescent dogs near the athletes village in the Caucasus Mountains, and well, it was love at first sight. She returned to the spot a few days later to check on her new friends. Sigourney found one of the dogs.

## Love At First Sight


Many share those sentiments. Silver medalist freeskier Gus Kenworthy plans to take five dogs home that he picked up on the streets of Rosa Khutor, close to the Olympic mountain venues.

"I wish I could bring this puppy home," Sigourney said.


Amanda Bird, U.S. bobsled and skeleton press officer, also plans to bring home a pooch. Those bringing back dogs are required to get two pieces of paper to do so: an international health certificate and proff of rabies vaccination. Her husband already has picked out a name: Sochi.

"I've been around animals all my life," said Kenworthy, of Telluride, Colo. "It's hard to watch."


Bird, who dreams of someday owning enough land to create an animal sanctuary, doesn't know if she will get a puppy home to Tennessee. Her charter flight doesn't allow dogs, so Bird is hoping someone will bring the animal home for her.

"Food is everywhere," Mayboroda said.


The online school was created in 2006, and has grown as an option for bullied students even as cyberbullying has become more prominent.

The school was given an "F" on the latest state report card. Not enough students at the school passed tests. Less than half of students at the school finish in four years.


The school has expelled and suspended students in the past, though it's not common, she said.

## A Happier Online Student


Sandra's case began when a nongovernmental organization filed for her habeas corpus in November, an unsuccessful petition that was later heard by the appeals court. Interest in procuring the orangutan's freedom dates back to 2012 when a previous administration at the Buenos Aires Zoo, led by zoologist Claudio Bertonatti, had considered the possibility of sending the ape to a sanctuary but never took any action.

## An Object No More


Individual whales can live much longer. Maximum longevity has been estimated at up to 90 years for females and 70 years for males, depending on the study.

## Lack Of Solid Information


The best known peer-reviewed study comparing annual survival rates between wild and captive killer whales was published in 1995 by a pair of fisheries service researchers. Using federal government records, they calculated an annual survival rate of a little more than 93 percent for captive orcas.

But there isn't much information out there. Scientists say it can be wrong to compare how long whales live in the wild to how long they live in parks. They say the better comparison to use is the "annual survival rate." That is an estimate of how many whales in a population can be expected to live through the year.


The survival rate "for captive killer whales seems to be improving, although that is certainly not the only metric that we should be using in evaluating husbandry practices in captivity," DeMaster said in an email interview. He added that newer data indicate that captive-born whales, in particular, appear to be surviving at about the same rate as wild whales.

That's a big difference. Put another way: Captive whales were dying three times as fast as wild whales were dying.


Orcas, also known as killer whales, are found in many of the world's oceans. The southern resident population, which spends several months each year in Puget Sound, is the only group listed in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

## "Lolita Is Healthy And Thriving"


New rules require boaters and whale-watching vessels to stay 200 yards from whales, but state enforcement has shown the response has been decidedly mixed, said Lynne Barre, head of protected resources for NOAA's Seattle office.

"They pick up contaminants from where they're going," Ford said. "L and K pods tend to pick up California-type contaminants, compared to J pod, which doesn't, and that's consistent with their distribution."

"One thing we're considering is that the northern-resident population may have first crack at the best salmon stocks," Hanson said. "A lot of the West Coast fish, they come out of the rivers. They turn right and head north."

Much of whale behavior can't be understood.


Ritzheimer warned law enforcement officials against creating "another Ruby Ridge," a reference to a deadly 1992 siege in northern Idaho between the FBI and backwoods cabin dweller Randy Weaver.

Harney County Sheriff David M. Ward has warned people in the area to avoid the refuge. He warned that the group stated that they just wanted to support local people who owned cattle ranches. Ranching families have had arguments with the government over the refuge.


"Yes, there are some people that are armed," Ritzheimer said. "We need to defend our rights. That's what the Second Amendment is there for, people."

In fact, Ward said, the protesters want to overthrow the American government.


"The FBI is on this every minute," Wyden said in an interview. "But based on comments from what we've heard in the community and what's been reported, we may be in just the early stages of this."

"Yes, there are some people that are armed," Ritzheimer said. "We need to defend our rights. That's what the Second Amendment is there for, people." The Constitution's Second Amendment says that people can own guns.


The Black Death was next, starting in 1334 in China and spreading along trade routes to Europe. It claimed an estimated 60 percent of the European population. Despite the massive losses, some say it may have played a role in ushering in the Renaissance, as the resulting huge labor shortages created a need for modernization.

The disease is certainly not common. Oregon has had only eight cases of plague over the past 20 years.


The final pandemic, the Modern Plague, also began in China, in the 1860s. It appeared in Hong Kong by 1894 and then spread throughout the world by rats on ships over the next two decades. It was during that pandemic that scientists discovered that the plague was caused by a bacteria and often spread through fleas.

## Rats Devour Oreos To The Last Crumb


"Just like humans, rats don't seem to get much pleasure out of eating (rice cakes)," Schroeder said.

In one experiment, rats were given Oreo cookies in one chamber and rice cakes in the other. It was clear, Honohan said, that the rats preferred the Oreos. They split the cookies apart and devoured the cream. Then, they went on to eat the cookies. Often they didn't bother to finish the rice cakes. But that was never the case with the Oreos.


There is also an element of reliability. After so many years of exposure to both the brand, which has been around since it was introduced by Nabisco in 1912, and the cookie's unique design, people are drawn to Oreos because no other cookie, no matter how similar, can replace the familiarity they offer. On the cookie's 75th birthday, in 1986, The New York Times wrote that "(Oreo) cookies are designed as consciously as buildings, and sometimes better."

On Twitter, Canada's justice minister and other government officials credited 58-year-old sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms. Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial hat.

According to witnesses, Zehaf-Bibeau carried a rifle and was dressed all in black with a scarf covering half his face. Zehaf-Bibeau shot the Canadian soldier guarding the memorial. The soldier's name was Nathan Cirillo.


In Washington, President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as "outrageous" and said: "We have to remain vigilant." The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.

## Guard Kills Attacker


Tony Zobl said he witnessed the Canadian soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I.

The Canadian prime minister promised to keep the country safe and work with Canada's allies to fight militants.


"I was just taking off my jacket to go into caucus. I hear this pop, pop, pop. Possibly 10 shots, don't really know. Thought it was dynamite or construction rather than anything else," said John McKay, a member of Parliament.

Government official Tony Clement wrote on Twitter that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament.


He said security guards then came rushing down the halls, herding them toward the back of the buildings.

"I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security," Kyle Seeback, another member of the government, wrote on Twitter.


Canada had raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday because of what it called "an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations." As recently as Tuesday, Canada sent eight fighter jets to the Mideast to join the battle against the Islamic State group.

## Events Canceled In Toronto


The unrest this month is the latest sign of disharmony between local musicians and their employers. The American Federation of Musicians has previously organized rallies against Marvel Studios for hiring London musicians to work on such movies as "The Avengers" and "Iron Man 3" even though those films were shot in the United States.

## The Movie Gets Whisked Away


A spokesman for Santa Monica-based Lionsgate declined to comment.

"'Draft Day' — what could be more American than that?" said violinist Rafael Rishik. "To say with a straight face that the only way we could do this without going broke is to score this in Macedonia — it's hard for us to swallow."


Producers and studio executives have long complained that California does not do enough to keep the movie business close to home. The state's tax credit, for example, excludes large-budget studio films. Musicians and other entertainment unions are backing legislation that would expand the credit.

A spokesman for Santa Monica-based Lionsgate declined to comment.


Musicians traditionally could count on film work being done in LA even when a movie was filmed elsewhere, because of the high level of talent here.

## It's A Financial Battle


Orchestras in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Macedonia also are attracting more Hollywood business.

The number of movie-scoring jobs has declined 50 percent in the last five years.


An official in the deputy commissioner's office of the adjoining Kech district, who also requested anonymity, said that district's latest death total was 43, based on doctors' reports. Media reports placed the number of known deaths across Pakistan at more than 285, including 20 bodies found Wednesday afternoon in an Awaran seminary.

By Wednesday afternoon,  216 people were confirmed dead in Awaran. Approximately 400 people were injured, according to a government official.


Tremors from the massive temblor were felt as far away as Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, and the Indian capital of New Delhi, several hundred miles to the east.

## "Our Whole Life Is Under The Rubble"


Jan Buledi, a spokesman for the Baluchistan government, told a news conference that its offices were sending 1,000 tents, 500 food bags, various types of medicine and a dozen ambulances to Awaran. However, steep terrain and the lack of paved roads continued to impede rescue operations, officials said.

"Right now, as I talk to you, I'm sitting on a rock beside the ruins," the teacher said. No government rescue workers had arrived yet, he said. "It's really hot, and we don't have any shelter. My three children were terrified, although they've now taken to playing in the debris. Our whole life is under the rubble."


"There are areas that are still not within reach, where fighting is going on, where we hope to get to sooner or later," Memon said. "But the quality of the campaign has improved."

The wide use of polio vaccines has helped to wipe out the disease in all but three countries of the world. Polio is still commonly found in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria.


The offensive focused largely on the North Waziristan tribal area, home to several militant groups including a Pakistani Taliban faction led by Hafiz Gul Bahadur, who banned the polio vaccine in June 2012 and said he would allow it only after the United States ceased drone strikes.

Mermon said that health workers are finding it easier to work in the tribal areas.


Ayub is gradually becoming a legend among his students, part of the dedication that led Irfan Siddiqi, a senior adviser to the prime minister, to nominate him for the "Pride of Performance" award, which is given to Pakistanis for contributions in various fields. Siddiqi, who is chairman of the awards committee, said he had read stories about Ayub; he went unannounced to see the school himself.

Ayub was not trained to be a teacher, but he taught students math. Ayub also taught the language Urdu and some beginning English.


"As soon as I looked at the camera, out popped the cub," she said. "I knew she still had one (cub) under her arm, so I knew she had had a second one."

The keeper reached into the den. He took out the cub that was lying on the floor.


Thompson ran out of the room, bumped into Dearie and shouted the news. They donned protective suits, booties and gloves in case they had to approach the panda enclosure or touch the cubs.

They wrapped the cub in a towel and carried it to the keeper's office, away from the den. "We don't want Mei Xiang to hear the cub," Thompson said. It would worry her to be so far away from her cub.


They wrapped the cub in a green towel and carried it to the incubator in the keeper's office, away from the den. "We don't want Mei Xiang to hear the cub," Thompson said. "We don't want to stress her."

Dr. Copper Aitken-Palmer is the chief veterinarian for an institute related to the zoo. When she arrived, she began calling people at a panda center in China.


"We were excited, but you're always nervous because you don't know if it's OK," she said. "But it sounded OK. ... Because it was squealing and carrying on, we thought, 'Oh, it's good.' But we ... were anxious for everybody to get there."

Many of today's teens are tethered to their digital gadgets and rarely crack a magazine or even a traditional, hardcover textbook. Yet students, teachers and industry experts say high school yearbooks remain surprisingly popular among the so-called digital natives of the Snapchat generation.

Surprisingly, many high school students don't want digital yearbooks. They still like hardcover yearbooks better.


Printed products have continued a downward spiral with the surge of digital technology. Yet despite a decline in spending per pupil on yearbooks, revenue on the publications nationwide has held steady for the past five years, in part because of an increase in student enrollment, according to a 2014 report from IBIS World, a market research firm.

## Students Prefer Hard Copies


Deborah recalls a recent chat in which a friend said Tatyana could next try the Iditarod sled race in Alaska. "Put a piece of tape over your mouth before she hears you," Deborah replied.

"What can I do next?" she says, describing her approach to sports. "I think that's the fun part."


Oh, and she also graduated from college.

"She is still very new in the sport," says her winter coach, John Farra. "But I would not count her out in any event she enters. They don't make them much tougher than this one."


Asked if she had time to enjoy it, McFadden smiles at the absurdity of her schedule. "I had a few days to myself after New York," she says, referring to her crowning marathon victory in November. One of her Illinois professors even gave her a cake in class.

## Birth Mom And Cousins At Sochi


Mucino, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a teenager, once saw herself as "just" a stay-at-home mom, with nothing to offer teachers, who she revered.

Ishimaru of University of Washington said parents are often left out when trying to fix schools. They are "the folks who have the most at stake and sometimes the most expertise on their own children," she said.

Friday was the second time this year that the City of Light has been a scene of mass murder; in January, Islamist gunmen attacked the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket, leaving a total of 17 dead.

The killers targeted spots where people were enjoying a regular Friday night. Soccer games, concerts and cafes were attacked.


World leaders rushed to condemn the attacks, and French President François Hollande vowed revenge on the Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility. "We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless," Hollande said outside the Bataclan concert hall, scene of the most bloodshed.

## Europe Is Targeted


Outside a popular cafe, witnesses reported seeing piles of bodies in the street, the cafe windows having been riddled with gunfire.

He said the wave of violence was not just an assault on France but "an attack on all of humanity and the universal values we share."

European governments let people move easily among European countries. Often, they do not have to show papers, like a passport. This might be changing. Sweden began border checks this week. It is trying to stop migrants coming in. Slovenia put barbed wire on its border with Croatia.

## French Newspaper Is Just For Kids


In Toronto, the school district's director of education issued guidelines Monday to help teachers and parents address the subject with their students and children. Tips included addressing students' concerns about the events and asking open-ended questions about their feelings.

In Paris, children went to school on Monday as usual. In one school, a teacher told a class of 7-year-old children to sit close together on the floor. She explained there were attackers. Then she said there were more and more police coming to protect people.


Experts say parents should avoid talking about the attacks with children younger than 6. For older children, parents should invite them to watch the news as a family and then discuss it, said Dr. Steven Berkowitz, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.

Donna Quan is in charge of education for schools in Toronto, Canada. Quan gave suggestions to help teachers and parents talk about the attack. She said that children should be able to talk about their worries. Adults should also ask them questions about how they feel.


Beginners who want to hit the ground running — but maybe not by running up a construction crane, James Bond-style — have the option of classes like those offered by London-Based Parkour Generations, a business with affiliates in California, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin, and that offers instruction in several countries including Thailand, Singapore and Brazil.

Parkour was developed in France in the 1980s. It mixes parts of martial arts, gymnastics, rock climbing and other sports. Participants use things like park benches, trees, handrails, and buildings as tools. They hop over them or under them to nimbly push themselves forward.

That's the idea behind de-extinction. Take DNA harvested from specimens stuffed in museum drawers, like Martha. Figure out which genes matter and then use the fast growing field of genetic engineering to edit the DNA of a closely related species into some version of the extinct species. If all goes well, a chimera of the long-lost Martha could be born and, one day, flocks of passenger pigeons could be restored to the regrown eastern North American woodlands.

When Martha died, it was the end of a species. Passenger pigeons had gone extinct.


De-extinction is not just for extinct species, after all. It could also be used to save a plant or animal that is on the verge of extinction. The black-footed ferret has been bred back from just seven viable individuals in the 1980s to thousands today, but the species may need a genetic transfusion to protect the new animals from the perils of inbreeding, which include reproductive problems, susceptibility to disease and genetic drift. So Revive and Restore has sequenced four ferret genomes, including two that had been stored in cell cultures from deep freeze at the Zoological Society of San Diego for the Frozen Ark Consortium, a global project to save the DNA and viable cells of endangered species. If genetic information from such frozen samples could be used to infuse robust genetics into a living population, it would be a first in the annals of conservation. "The northern white rhino has only four living individuals left. They are not viable," says Ryan Phelan of Long Now, who has petted the last individuals of this functionally extinct species. "Do we use genomic techniques and advanced genetic technology to keep that species alive or let it march over to the right on the continuum of extinction and become extinct?"

It works like this: Take DNA collected from extinct animals, like Martha. Figure out which genes matter and combine them with the genes of a closely related species that still exists.


And Paul has repeatedly sparred with some of his GOP colleagues, including both Sen. John McCain of Arizona, and likely challenger Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, over foreign policy and other issues. But as he has approached his presidential run, Paul has been mending fences with many Republican colleagues, including his state's senior senator, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell has endorsed Paul's push for a Kentucky presidential caucus, which would allow the junior senator to run for president and his Senate seat simultaneously.

Paul still works as an ophthalmologist, or eye doctor. Even now, he performs free eye surgeries. Paul did not hold elected office until running for the Senate in 2010. Yet he has been involved in politics for his entire life. He is the son of one of America's most famous politicians, Ron Paul.

Sunday marks the 73rd anniversary of the Japanese attack that killed about 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers. During a private event Sunday, the four men will toast their shipmates, drinking from replicas of champagne glasses from the Arizona. They will share a bottle of sparkling wine that was a gift to the survivors association from President Gerald Ford's visit to Spain in 1975.

The four survivors gathered on Tuesday near the memorial that sits on top of the sunken Arizona. The event was the last official gathering of the USS Arizona Reunion Association. However, the men said they still plan to get together, even if they can't come to Hawaii.


White pelicans, after all, are accustomed to communal living. When it's breeding season, thousands of them will take over an entire island, crammed together in a one big orgy of courtship and nest-building. They are serial monogamists.

## Brown Pelicans Are Much More Common


On March 8, state wildlife officer Heidi Cogburn and Orange County Deputy Kevin Oglesby, who works for the marine unit, were patrolling the St. Johns River near Sanford when they saw a small, struggling white pelican in the water.

That was on March 7.


Meanwhile, X-rays of Pierre reveal an injured joint that has started to heal. And in the weeks since his rescue, with physical rehabilitation, he has regained increasing mobility.

Lara Croft is a veterinarian at SeaWorld. Croft said Claire was hurt so badly she had to remove part of the pelican's wing. Claire will never be able to fly, but she is able to walk.


But he has not left Claire's side, except when forced. Her bandages do need changing, after all.

## Pierre Is Recovering Well


His eyes dart between the intruders and her, keeping tabs on both.

"They're always right next to each other," Croft says. "They walk together. They swim together. They rest together."

But watch this huddle of shuffling penguins long enough, and there emerge distinct waves of motion through the feathered masses as one penguin takes a step and the rest follow. It's a way of maintaining order — something humans have trouble doing, Gerum pointed out.

"If you look at a penguin huddle in real time, you hardly see any movement at all — they are all standing very still," said Richard Gerum. He is a German scientist. He is an author of the study published in the New Journal of Physics.


So the rover, while not perfect, was a marked improvement on many levels — a finding echoed by the scientists' rover tests among a population of emperor penguins within Adelie Land.

## All Dressed Up And Ready For Research


Emperor penguins are less territorial than the king penguins, and of the 158 birds tested, 28 percent "reacted with alertness," 47 percent didn't seem to react at all, and 25 percent appeared to be curious enough to come closer and check out the rover.

Scientists used the robot with emperor penguins in another part of Antarctica. They found that these birds were even more interested in the rover.


The researchers even tried out their rover on elephant seals, who didn't budge when a rover came close to their heads or tails (which is where they are usually tagged). That's a good sign; as a rule, an elephant seal does not react kindly to someone approaching its backside.

All of the adult and baby emperor penguins got very close when it approached. Some penguins even tried to talk to the disguised "baby" rover.


The discoveries of elements 113, 115, 117 and 118 were confirmed last week by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. The group vets the man-made elements seeking a permanent spot on the chart that adorns chemistry classrooms around the world.

Elements make up all matter. They cannot be separated into smaller materials. Atoms are the building blocks that make up elements. At the center of each atom is a nucleus. Inside of it are small particles or pieces called protons and neutrons. 


"It's really hard to smash two things together and get them to stick," Shaughnessy said. "There is so much positive charge — they want to repel each other."

Scientists cannot see unstable elements. Scientists know about the elements because they can measure what remains after the elements break down.


It takes several months to try this smashing experiment roughly 10 quintillion times (10 followed by 18 zeros). If just one of those attempts works, the experiment is considered a success.

## A Mashing Game Of Chance


The team from Lawrence Livermore and their Russian colleagues had previously named element 116 Livermorium in honor of the Northern California lab. No word on what 115, 117 and 118 might be called.

Element 113 was discovered by a Japanese group. They are the first Asian scientists to find a new element.

More disposable income has made the uptick in sales possible. Larry Morton, president of Hal Leonard Corp., an educational music print publisher, noted that the sale of new pianos is directly tied to real estate. As housing becomes available and affordable, new homeowners are more likely to buy big-ticket items.

Piano sales are not dying, just changing, said Dennis Saphir. He used to own a piano store. Saphir said there are too many used and digital pianos for sale. That cuts into sales of traditional, or acoustic, pianos.


Saphir shuttered his last showroom in April in favor of an online marketplace. The seventh generation owner of the family business — which started in Vienna, Austria, in the early 1800s — struggled to keep the business afloat after the 2008 economic recession. Five showrooms were gradually pared down to none.

Thomas Zoells fell in love with the piano growing up in Switzerland and has never grown out of it. He is one of Chicago's biggest piano fans. Zoells opened his shop, PianoForte, in 2004, and he sells very expensive pianos.

Pierson, a 30-year Secret Service veteran, was named director only 18 months ago after a prostitution scandal and other problems suggested poor discipline and inadequate oversight in the supposedly elite force responsible for protecting the president, his family and visiting foreign leaders.

Pierson stepped down following two serious events. Both could have put the president's life in danger, and in both cases, the Secret Service performed poorly.

In Zhulin, Pan's relatives had a reason for why he had gotten mixed up in that line of work. His wife, Hang Yaqin, hiked up her T-shirt. She unwrapped a strap of gauze and pointed to a tube. She explained she had received a kidney transplant in December 2010.


Their growing numbers at shelters have run counter to what otherwise has been a great success in animal care in recent decades — a steady decline in impounded and euthanized pets, due primarily to sterilizations and adoptions. In Chicago, the number of animals put down each year dropped by more than half from 2006 through last year, to about 8,000. The number of pit bulls impounded, however, went steadily up from 2010 to 2012, with the number euthanized generally also increasing.

To the extent that kids cut back on pizza, they did so at dinnertime. Calories consumed in the form of pizza dinners fell by 40 percent for younger children and 33 percent for teens. By the end of the study period, the amount of pizza eaten for dinner was comparable to the amount eaten for lunch.

But on days when they eat pizza it shoots up. Pizza makes up a fifth of young children's calories on days they eat it, the professors found. It makes up a quarter of teens' calories on pizza days. Calories measure how much energy a person gets from eating food. Sometimes people eat more calories than their bodies use. The body stores those extra calories as fat.


Technicians aboard the Australian ship Ocean Shield were set Monday afternoon to start deploying the Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle in the Indian Ocean, sending it 2.8 miles down to the seabed and using its side-scanning sonar arrays to look for wreckage from the plane.

Investigators looking for the vanished Boeing 777 have put away their pinger locating tool. They are about to call off searches on the ocean surface. They are sending the small robotic sub underwater. It will scan the ocean in an area bigger than the city of Los Angeles.


"You give it a track and it goes," said Charitha Pattiaratchi, a professor of oceanography at the University of Western Australia. "It doesn't transfer any imagery or anything while it's down there."

## Sub Below, Crew Above


On four occasions, starting April 5, a pinger locator towed by the Ocean Shield picked up transmissions from what investigators strongly suspect were one or both of the black boxes. But with no new transmissions in the last six days, investigators have apparently concluded that the batteries on those devices — which are supposed to last 30 days — have run out.

"You give it a track and it goes," said Charitha Pattiaratchi. He is an oceanographer. The sub doesn't send the crew "anything while it's down there."


However, investigators did not have any detected signals from the plane's black boxes, and repeated searches with underwater vehicles and sonar scanning equipment turned up no debris on the ocean floor for nearly two years. Finally, a Metron analysis helped identify a tract that had been searched only by a towed pinger locator and not by an underwater vehicle similar to the Bluefin-21. Within a week, the underwater wreckage had been located.

"It sounds like Angus Houston said some words to prepare everybody. They're going to, in a couple days, shut down all the air and surface" searching, he added.

"We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters in Berlin. "All that will be investigated thoroughly."

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box had been located at the crash site and "will be immediately investigated." He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.


"There is no indication of a nexus to terrorism at this time," U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said.

Merkel said that officials do not know much beyond the basic information about the flight. She said it was still too soon to guess what happened.


"It's going to be very difficult to get there. The mountain is snowy and very hostile," he said.

In Paris, French President Francois Hollande called the crash "a tragedy on our soil."


"Since 1869, baseball has been doing pretty well," Rose said. "The only rules they ever changed was the mound (height) and the DH. I thought baseball was doing pretty good. Maybe I'm wrong about the attendance figures and the number of people going to ballgames."

"You're not allowed to pitch inside. The hitters wear more armor than the Humvees in Afghanistan," Pete Rose said in a telephone interview. "Now you're not allowed to be safe at home plate? What's the game coming to?"


Citing player safety, Alderson said wording of the rules change will be presented to owners for approval at their Jan. 16 meeting in Paradise Valley, Ariz.

It seems "the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball," added Rose, who was banned from baseball for life following a gambling investigation.


Discussion to limit or ban collisions has intensified since May 2011, when San Francisco's Buster Posey was injured by Florida's Scott Cousins. Posey, an All-Star catcher, sustained a broken bone in his lower left leg and three torn ligaments in his ankle, an injury that ended his season.

The union did not want to comment while the rule is being reviewed.


Posey returned to win the NL batting title and MVP award in 2012, when he led the Giants to their second World Series title in three seasons.

"If the public has this type of technology with cellphones and iPads, why not all the better that we have this resource for our officers too?" De Anda said.


One chilly evening not long ago, a panel of police officers met with citizens gathered here at City Hall to offer advice on a subject that has come up in almost every city in America: What happens when a young African-American man is stopped by the police? What makes a traffic stop turn fatal?

Nothing like that has happened in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Recently, a group of police officers there met with residents to make sure it never does.


In that simple civics lesson is the root of the problem. Congress passes legislation to spend, but it's the president who must ensure those bills get paid. Those two objectives don't neatly line up. President Barack Obama complains that past presidents haven't been subjected to the types of conditions being asked of him in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling, but it just isn't true. To the contrary, there's plenty of precedent.

## Founding Fathers' Fault?


The debt ceiling actually fell, to $270 billion, after the war and stayed there until about 1954. The Korean War was paid for through higher taxes, not more debt. And between 1954 and 1962, the debt limit fell twice and increased seven times. It didn't return to the World War II high-water mark again until March 1962.

## Borrowing Limit Began 100 Years Ago


From that point forward, there were 69 changes to the debt limit through the end of the 2007-2008 fiscal year, including the largest single-chunk increase, $984 billion in May 2003, as America borrowed to pay for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq while also cutting taxes.

But the legal limit on just how much debt the federal government can borrow began almost 100 years ago. That is when Congress said the Treasury could sell long-term Liberty Bonds.


A study conducted with nearly three centuries of data (but also with tongue planted firmly in cheek) has found that after an election for parliamentary leadership or the presidency, losers lived four more years than did the winners who went on to serve as heads of state.

In Maryland, where the Whigs held four of their national conventions in the mid-19th century, the hub of the renaissance is in Cecil County. Tim Zane, a registered Republican and a former vice president and senior cash manager at a large international bank, is in talks to be in charge of the Maryland branch of the new and improved Modern Whig Party.

Heshy Bucholz is a software engineer in Philadelphia. He is also the first person to run and win as a Whig in that city in 157 years. He was voted in as an election judge last month. His victory has brought national attention to the party and caused hundreds of new members to sign up.


In Washington today, "one side shuts down so the other side doesn't talk," said Brendan Galligan, chairman of the New Jersey chapter of the Modern Whig Party, and an elected school board member in Westfield, N.J.

"They haven't done anything for a couple hundred years, but let me click on their link," Galligan said about his discovery of the Whigs.

"It is a rebellion against gridlock in Washington," Hay said.


"The old Whigs were about building the country. Now it's about helping us from falling apart," Galligan said.

"They'd think you were talking about a hairpiece," Hay said.


"I think if you ask people about the Whig tradition today, they'd think you were talking about a hairpiece," Hay said.

"The Whigs … can claim to be the first real party of the people," said Andrew Evans, national leader of the Modern Whig Party. Abraham Lincoln was among the party's famous members, he said.


Although all polygraph testing is controversial, many scientists are highly critical of its use in job screening, saying it's especially prone to inaccuracies because the questions are often more vague than they are in criminal investigations and therefore they're more likely to provoke reactions from the innocent that might seem like deception.

## Sweating It Out

## Pills (Lots) Swallowed In One Sitting


Dairy farmer Ron Koetsier's 1,200 cows produce roughly 90 tons of manure daily, and for the past three decades, he has tried unsuccessfully to turn the stinky dung into energy to power his 450-acre farm in Visalia, Calif.

Dairy farmer Ron Koetsier's 1,200 cows produce roughly 90 tons of manure each day. And for the past three decades, he has tried unsuccessfully to turn the stinky dung into energy. He wants to power his 450-acre farm in Visalia, Calif., using that energy.


All that could be changing as renewable energy companies develop new ways of running digesters to boost profits. They're improving technology to meet tough smog-control rules. At the same time, the state is trying out a streamlined permitting process to help remove costly regulatory hurdles. Koetsier will be the first dairy farmer to install a digester under the state's program. He said he is optimistic that this go-around — his third attempt to make a system work — will finally pay off. After hearing of the technological and other advances, he decided to "give it another whirl," Koetsier said.

## "Pasteurizing" Energy


Dairy farmers have plenty of manure lying around to convert to energy. A typical cow can produce as much as 150 pounds of dung daily. That presents a continuing challenge for farmers to dispose of waste and control the methane — a greenhouse gas — produced by decomposing manure.

## A Lot Of Cow Pies


The goal is to involve all the various permitting agencies in the beginning of the process to ensure there are no surprises later, Cal/EPA's Blue said.

It's also harder for the poor to get smoking-cessation counseling and nicotine patches than others who may receive help through insurance, experts said.

Not having money causes terrible suffering, Chilton said. It can hurt a person's mind. "One of the fastest, most convenient ways to help is a cigarette. It'll keep you sane, and keep you from hurting yourself or others."


Even as health insurance comes to the poor through the Affordable Care Act, smoking remains a problem: Smokers may be charged a premium of up to 50 percent, according to Frank Leone, director of the Comprehensive Smoking Treatment Program at the University of Pennsylvania.

## One Cigarette, Then Straight To Bed


"People smoke knowing is not good for them," said Leone of Penn, who is also a pulmonologist. "Nicotine gets into the part of the brain stem that creates a sense of safety, comfort, warmth. If you have to decide between buying bread or cigarettes, not buying cigarettes creates a disease and agitation in the brain that says there's only one way to fix this situation: Just smoke."

Elijah Anderson works at Yale University studying the way people live. He said people shouldn't "blame the victim" by simply criticizing smoking behavior. It's important to understand the effect of poverty and its causes. He added that many poor people don't see a future for themselves. For this reason, many see no point in protecting their health.


The steam has no role in powering the jump, according to the study. "No rocket effect," they wrote.

## Pop Into The Microphone


Security, already frayed by Francis' tendency to ignore the restrictive rules, and sheer logistics were complicated. The recently paved streets inside the favela are narrow; large parts of the slum are essentially in ruins, and the crowds, though perhaps admiring of the pope, are unpredictable. But the visit seemed to go off without any major hitches.




"I am absolutely sure the only reason" for the improvements "is that the pope is coming," said Rita de Cassia, 37, an occasional maid who was helping out at the small stone St. Jeronimo Emiliano church where the pope will pray.

"This is really important for us," said office worker Milena de Souza. "He's a representative of humility and caring and most importantly, true peace, which is something we need here. Because of all the violence we've had here, hopefully, the pope can bless us."


Government sharpshooters lined the route.

Rita de Cassia said the only reason for the improvements was the pope's visit.


To enter, Pari rang a hidden doorbell; if it were more prominent, he said, he's sure that hostile neighbors would ring it day and night. On Maundy Thursday this year, just before Easter, Pari said, an Orthodox Jewish man threatened to kill him if he prayed in the Upper Room. He said he was careful not to wear his brown Franciscan habit during the protests. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said no reports of death threats had been filed.

"It's exciting. It's very deep," Pari said of the room. "If you think that everything started from here. This is a place where you feel a lot of energy."


"Jews will not be able to pray here, and this is something no Jew can accept," he said.

He pointed to a smooth paved courtyard. Underneath, he said, were the tombs of David and several other ancient Jewish kings. A doorway from the courtyard led to a small synagogue, where men prayed in Hebrew.


Bendcowsky said she worried about the atmosphere in the area over the last few months.

Lili Garcia was 17 when she married the love of her life, Junior, in the church 54 years ago. On a recent afternoon, she was missing the church and her husband, who died a year ago.

Vianel Garcia runs the beauty salon. She and her mother, Amparo Duarte, plan to fly balloons outside the little shop on the big day. They are also planning a party inside the salon for people hoping for a glimpse of the pope.


Garcia held a black-and-white photograph of the wedding couple, she in a puffy white dress, Junior in a rented tuxedo. She clutched it to her chest and wept.

"I get goose bumps just thinking about it," Duarte said.


In addition to meeting a few pupils selected by lottery, Francis also will visit with dozens of refugees and immigrants while at Our Lady Queen of Angels, including some youths who were among the wave of unaccompanied minors who have entered the United States.

"I'm worried about business. Why do I care about the pope?" Sheeri said as he puffed on a cigarette.


Not everyone on the block is caught up in papal excitement. Danny Sheeri, who works at a plumbing store a few doors up from the beauty salon, shrugged.

"It's a big blessing to have the pope," Garcia said. "We know we're going to have a lot of change. We can feel it."


The Beatles and the Rolling Stones didn't spark the British Invasion of the 1960s, but they did fan its flames.

For one thing, the most important change in American pop music was the birth of rap in the early 1990s.


These are the conclusions of engineers and biologists who analyzed 17,000 digitized songs from Billboard's Hot 100 to produce an evolutionary history of American popular music — no listening required. Their results were published Wednesday, May 6 in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

## Dinosaur Fossils ... And Songs


"Why are there so many creatures?" he mused. "Why are there so many songs?"

Leroi said "culture can — and should — be studied scientifically." Evolutionary biology offers a perfect way to study the arts, he said.


To trace the evolution of pop, Leroi and his co-authors used 30-second snippets of 17,904 songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 list from 1960 to 2010. This digital music library represented 86 percent of all the singles that made it on the Hot 100 list during that 50-year span.

"Why are there so many creatures?" he wondered. "Why are there so many songs?"


By and large, the judgments of the computer and the humans matched up. Songs that the algorithms classified as Style 2, for example, had received Last.fm tags such as "hip-hop," "rap" and "old school." Songs computer-sorted into Style 8 had been described by listeners as "new wave," "dance" and "electronic."

They used computers to study and organize songs into different styles. The scientists decided not to use the kind of categories listeners might use. Listeners might label what they hear "hard rock," "folk" or "electronic," for example. Instead, the scientists grouped songs by features that could be measured, including chords (a group of notes) and rhythms.


"Everything sounds like Duran Duran for a while," he said.

## Lots Of Variety


Looking more closely at the works of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, the researchers discovered that those pivotal bands didn't initiate the widespread changes associated with the music of their era. Rather, they accelerated those musical changes by popularizing new trends.

"Quantification has triumphed in field after field of the natural and social sciences," he said. "It will here, too."

At Montna Farms, 5,000 acres outside the Sacramento Valley's Yuba City that produce sticky, short-grain rice for sushi, manager Jon Munger was pushing this week to get fields harvested, prepared and flooded again by the next day for the pop-up wetlands.

## Shorebirds Stand, Waiting


Five years ago, WIC began to include fruits and vegetables. White potatoes were omitted.

## Give The Potato Some Respect


Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from the potato-growing state of Maine, lauded the crop in a statement, saying, "The potato has more potassium than bananas, a food commonly associated with this nutrient, which is important for pregnant women and new mothers."

Mark Szymanski is a spokesman for the council. The decision to leave out the potato, he says, is not based on good "science or common sense." WIC, he said, "is singling out one item from the entire food basket." It is saying, "Do not eat this because it's somehow lacking."


White potatoes themselves pose a problem, said Chelsea Anderson, a registered dietitian at St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in North Philadelphia, a neighborhood plagued by childhood obesity.

## Too Many Fries


Obama also is asking lawmakers to increase paid leave for workers. And he's moved unilaterally to lower a mortgage insurance rate that could help attract first-time homebuyers.

## Dealing With Cuba


The White House rolled out many of the president's most significant proposals ahead of the speech. And rather than deliver an address littered with policy proposals, administration officials said Obama instead planned to talk more about the values that undergird his agenda and promote a story of economic recovery.

President Obama spoke about his decision to change how the United States deals with Cuba. The U.S. has not allowed any business with the communist country for more than 50 years.


House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, announced that his guest would be Cuban dissident Jorge Luis García Pérez, who spent 17 years in a Cuban prison. Florida Republican Senator Macro Rubio was bringing Rosa Maria Paya Acevedo, whose father was a well-known Cuban dissident who was killed in a car accident that his family believes was suspicious.

McConnell, the majority leader, said Obama should work with Republicans. They want to fix programs that give older people health care and money when they stop working. Republicans also want to make sure the U.S. doesn't spend money it doesn't have. He said Obama should not just tax people more.


Obama was touting his decision to resume relations with Cuba after a half-century of estrangement. He wants Congress to lift the decades-long economic embargo on Cuba, though administration officials say they don't expect lawmakers to move on that request quickly.

## "All About The Ripple Effect"


WASHINGTON — The overall picture of poverty among states is a familiar one: Some states, such as Mississippi, have long claimed the highest poverty rates according to the federal income standard. Others, such as Hawaii, Maryland and Massachusetts, often are at the opposite end, with poverty rates less than half those in more impoverished states.

WASHINGTON — Some of the poorest people in the United States live in some of the wealthiest states, says a new report.


The Census Bureau's measure of income includes earnings before taxes and a range of other benefits, but notably excludes food stamps and housing support, which often supplement poor Americans' household spending.

## Deep Poverty In Rich States


Other states, such as New Mexico and Louisiana, had above-average poverty rates in 1959 but have fallen further behind in the years since. In 2012, New Mexico and Louisiana had the second- and third-highest poverty rates under the current standard, which is household income of less than $23,492 for a family of four.

By 2012, just one out of every seven families was in poverty. The current poverty line is an income of less than $23,492 for a family of four.


Mississippi's nation-leading official poverty rate of 22 percent in 2012 falls to 16.1 percent under the supplemental measure. New Mexico's 20.4 percent drops to 16.4 percent under the supplemental standard, while Arkansas' 20.1 percent falls to 16.5 percent.

Mississippi had the worst levels of poverty in 2012. One out of every five families was poor under the old measure. But that falls to one out of every six under the new measure. New Mexico and Arkansas both had the same kinds of improvement.


Alas: Not really! As smug gentlemen and scholars have pointed out across the Internet, $1.3 billion divided by 300 million is actually a paltry $4.33\. (Also, not to nitpick here, but the U.S. population was 308.7 million as of the 2010 census - and only 234.6 million, if you exclude children under age 18.)

## "Poverty Solved!" Oops, Check Your Math


New research by the team that coined the term attempts to determine how severely predatory fish populations have declined worldwide since the start of industrial fishing. Scientists analyzed more than 200 published food-web (interacting food chains) models from all over the world, which included more than 3,000 ocean species. Their results show that in the 20th century humans reduced the biomass of predatory fish by more than two-thirds and that most of this alarming decline has occurred since the 1970s.

Top predators are at the top of food chains. Food chains can be thought of as a series of levels. Each level relies on the one below for food. An ocean food chain starts with plant life. Tiny animals like shrimp eat those, small fish eat the shrimp, and bigger fish eat those smaller fish. Each level helps control the populations at the lower levels, keeping all the ocean life in balance.

The nation's 28th president was having trouble persuading his political enemies in the Senate to ratify the Treaty of Versailles, the document that ended World War I. A two-thirds majority vote was needed to approve the treaty, which also provided for the creation of the League of Nations. To drum up public support, Wilson embarked on a whistle-stop tour of the country. Three weeks into the tour, on Sept. 25, 1919, in Pueblo, Colo., Wilson collapsed from exhaustion.

## Abraham Lincoln


"There was a question of what's in good taste and what's not in good taste, what would be reckless speculation," O'Toole said. "There was a great deal more circumspection about commenting and guessing in that time than there is in ours. People don't need a single fact now to go off on a tirade."

## Grover Cleveland


"There was important stuff, quite in addition to the fight over the Treaty of Versailles, that needed to be taken care of that just wasn't taken care of" between Wilson's stroke and the end of his second term, in March 1921, O'Toole said. He died Feb. 3, 1924, at 67, from complications related to his stroke and heart problems.

## John F. Kennedy


— Abraham Lincoln: What friends and observers simply described as "melancholy," we know now are the classic symptoms of depression, from which Lincoln suffered most of his life, even before the Civil War and the deaths of two of his sons. Lincoln "often wept in public and recited maudlin poetry," Joshua Wolf Shenk, author of the 2006 book "Lincoln's Melancholy," wrote in The Atlantic in 2005. "He told jokes and stories at odd times – he needed the laughs, he said, for his survival. As a young man he talked more than once of suicide, and as he grew older he said he saw the world as hard and grim, full of misery, made that way by fate and the forces of God." There are different degrees of depression, however, and clearly Lincoln was able to carry out his duties during the nation's darkest period.

## Ronald Reagan


Residents in Atlanta, Georgia, tied themselves to trees and lay down in front of bulldozers to stop the city from building a two-lane highway through a public park leading to President Jimmy Carter's library.

In College Station, Texas, people fought against having one at Texas A&amp;M University. The university had planned to move a pig farm to make way for the George H.W. Bush presidential library.


And in Little Rock, Arkansas, the city evoked eminent domain to tear down old warehouses where homeless people slept to make way for President Bill Clinton's library.

In Atlanta, Georgia, people tied themselves to trees and laid down in front of bulldozers. They wanted to stop a two-lane highway to President Jimmy Carter's library at the top of a hill in a park.


The University of Chicago proposed to build the library on 20 acres in either Washington Park or Jackson Park on the South Side.

## A Presidential Place


"In general, presidents don't want controversy. It doesn't help them," Hufbauer said.

## Two City Parks


In the end, the city seized the land on behalf of the university through eminent domain and the 347-unit complex was razed. The land is now is part of the grounds of the George W. Bush Presidential Center.

## Clinton And Carter


Like SMU, the University of Chicago is landlocked and for more than a decade has quietly been buying property in the Washington Park neighborhood. While the university has offered a 6-acre parcel across the street from the park — the largest lot it owns in the neighborhood — school officials said the space was too small for a modern-day presidential library. Clinton's library is on 38 acres and George W. Bush's is on 23 acres. The university also is offering an adjacent 5 acres owned by the city and the Chicago Transit Authority.

In Little Rock, officials argued over the meaning of a park. The city had plans to build President Bill Clinton's library on the edge of downtown. The problem was, there were already some unused warehouses there. This sparked a court battle that lasted nearly five years. The city argued that it could just take the private land, make it into a park, and then build a library for Clinton.


Each was asked to sign a contract promising to come to class every day and to follow small rules, like being on time. Teachers would assess their behavior on a scale of one to five during each period of each day. If they earned consistent marks, they could graduate from the program.

MIAMI — In a Federal Bureau of Prisons first, inmates serving time in a Miami federal detention center were allowed to dance with their daughters for an afternoon as part of a re-entry program. The theme: There's still time at the ball, still time to take an active role in their daughters' lives.

MIAMI — Ernest Williams had stopped asking his family to come see him in prison. The visits left him too sad and hurt, reminding him of his lost freedom.


Weeks later, Williams says, he had a dream while sleeping in his cell, an unclouded vision of him dancing with his three daughters. The next day, he said yes.

## There's Still Time


The fathers and daughters mingled until Luther Vandross' ballad, "Dance With My Father," began to play. The fathers escorted their daughters to the floor where they danced and hugged and wiped away the tears of their girls — and their own. Then the fathers performed a choreographed dance for their daughters to the Temptations' "My Girl."

Each of the girls walked through metal doors to get into the prison. They had to remove their shoes, jewelry and belts to go through a body scanner.

Briscoe created a prison literacy program in Tennessee called BRAINS (Books Rehabilitating American Inmates National Society), where men contributed $2 each to update the prison library. Recently, he's turned his focus to a different demographic, the high-risk 12-year-old Briscoes.

## A Finally Free Man


While still on parole two years ago, Briscoe founded a community literacy initiative called To Succeed You Must Read! The program reaches students in schools and libraries, and includes a summer book club. Last summer, 400 neighbors and friends celebrated the effort with a block party.

For the first time in 22 years, he was truly free.

They also have a captive audience. But roughly a third of California's inmates can't read above a sixth-grade level, according to state statistics.

## Two Things You Don't Criticize


Four decades earlier, Drummond had been a reporter for the Los Angeles Times. He wrote a story about a deadly shooting at UCLA that led to conspiracy convictions for Stiner and his brother. Now Stiner pens the "OG's perspective" column.

David Marsh earned a journalism degree more than 30 years ago but never used it before he wound up at San Quentin for selling drugs. He joined the prison newspaper.


Despite the benefits, the exercise and meditation can be a hard sell to some of the incarcerated men and women with traumatic backgrounds who have never encountered it before, Savelli said.

"The few poses that I had seen, I kinda just glanced it over and said 'oh, that's white people exercise,'" Feltus said.


At least three other Illinois Department of Corrections prisons also currently offer yoga or mediation programs of inmates, said Tom Shaer, spokesman for the department. At Stateville Correctional Center yoga had been offered but is on hiatus because of a lack of space, Shaer said. But because it's so well-received, it's expected to return.




The results aren't that shocking in the U.S., where many parents fret over chemicals in cured meats and the American Cancer Society has long cautioned against eating too much steak and deli.

## Bacon, Bologna And Colon Cancer




## Happy Doctors, Angry Meat Producers


An ounce and three-quarters is roughly equivalent to a hot dog or a few slices of bologna, though it depends on how thinly it is sliced.

The meat institute said cancer is a complicated disease, with many causes. It said cancer is "not caused by single foods."


Overall, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer in the United States is about 1 in 20, or 5 percent, according to the cancer society. By the WHO's calculations, having a cold-cut sandwich every day would raise that to only around 6 percent.

## Hot Dogs, Smoking And Danger


The North American Meat Institute argued in a statement that "cancer is a complex disease not caused by single foods."

Cancer expert Susan Gapstur said the WHO report is "an important step" in helping people make healthier food choices. She suggests choosing fish or chicken instead of red meat or processed meat.


And it is a market that is booming. Last year, analysts at Wells Fargo estimated the overall value of the e-cigarette market at $2.5 billion and predicted growth to $10 billion annually by 2017.

## Nicotine Is Not Harmless


So when an invention came along — e-cigarettes — that supply nicotine in much the same way as a tobacco cigarette, but without any apparent link to cancer or lung disease, there were many cheers.

It looked at scientific evidence from more than 7,000 articles on smoking and disease. Based on those studies, the report cited tobacco smoking as a major cause of lung and throat cancer.


Lives could be saved.

## An Anti-Smoking Aid


He says e-cigarette regulation should take into account the "continuum of risk: that there are different nicotine-containing and nicotine-delivering products that pose different levels of risk to the individual," and regulate accordingly.

How can they try to ban a product that saves lives?


And many other policy changes that redistribute income upward.

## "Reforms" Hurt Workers


If Congress mandated fast-food restaurants to pay $15 an hour, they would have to change operations to deliver the kind of productivity to justify those higher costs. That would mean replacing current workers with machines and hiring fewer, more skilled workers to maintain them.

American minimum-wage earners make more because they produce more. Better education and better-funded companies allow American workers to be more productive, raising their earnings.


Those who consider such a trade-off worthwhile miss the economic role of minimum-wage jobs. For most workers, they are entry-level positions where they can gain experience that makes them more productive and helps them command higher pay in their next job.

For better or worse, fast-food jobs are relatively low-productivity positions, typically filled by inexperienced workers. Most fast-food customers want a quick, inexpensive meal. They will not regularly pay premium prices for a burger and fries.


The Samoan economy collapsed. The islands' governor begged Congress to suspend the wage hikes, pleading: "Our job market is being torched. Our businesses are being depressed. Our hope for growth has been driven away ... How much does our government expect us to suffer?"

## Fast Food Is Entry-Level Work


Much of today's bottled water, however, is not glacier or natural spring water but processed water, which is municipal water or, more often, directly extracted groundwater that has been subjected to reverse osmosis or other purification treatments. Not surprisingly, bottlers have been embroiled in disputes with local authorities and citizens' groups in many places over their role in water depletion, and even pollution. In drought-seared California, some bottlers have faced protests and probes; one company was even banned from tapping spring water.

The environmental problems start early. Most bottled water comes from underground water. Much of this underground water could have flowed into rivers and lakes. Using this water can make droughts worse.


Although this will undoubtedly be tough for the one-child generation, an unintended side effect will be a surge in consumption, as its members will have little choice but to spend a lot more. A comparison of families that had twins under the one-child policy and those that had just one child offers an indication of the scale of the change in consumption (though, of course, the inability of twins' parents to spread out consumption spending over time means that it is not a perfect representation).

## Where Is The ATM Machine?


There is, however, a caveat. More children also mean less education investment per child, which could lead to lower human-capital attainment. Indeed, the average twin receives far less support after age 15 than the average only child, creating large differences in education outcomes. Twins are 40 percent more likely to go to a vocational high school than only children.

This innovative approach to policing has already produced results. Ol Pejeta has not lost an elephant in many years, and only a very few rhinos have been killed.

Around 50,000 elephants were poached in 2013. There are now only about 50,000 left in all of Central Africa. 


A New Orleans school board thought not. After adopting a resolution declaring that no school should be named after a slaveholder, it renamed George Washington Elementary School after an African-American surgeon who fought for desegregation of blood transfusions. Should the name of the country's capital city be reconsidered, too?

Wilson gave African-Americans lower jobs than the one they previously had. When they protested, he told them that segregation was good.


Wilson's contributions to the university, the U.S., and the world cannot and should not be erased from history. They should, instead, be recognized in a manner that creates a nuanced conversation about changing values, and includes both his positive achievements and his contributions to America's racist policies and practices.

In New Orleans, a school board decided that schools should not be named after slave owners, even if they were presidents. They renamed George Washington Elementary School after an African-American doctor who fought to end segregation in the way medicine was practiced.


Over the weekend, school principal Kathy Scott sent an email to parents bringing the draft to their attention and urging them to dissuade their kids from participating. "It is not OK for any student to be objectified or judged in any way," the letter said, adding that "this is not behavior that is consistent with our school's outstanding reputation."

The picks were announced to all the boys. They "were generally applauded," said one email to the media. The emails claimed the draft "was planned and organized with only the best intentions in mind." The yearly prom draft "provides a solution for two guys who want to ask the same girl." The prom is a dance usually held at the end of the last year of high school.


Forty senior boys assembled recently at a "private venue" clad in ceremonial sport coats to participate in the ritual, according to the emails. Numbers were plucked from a number ball roller and issued to the boys, who took turns selecting girls. Each boy was put on the clock and given two minutes to make a selection.

Over the weekend, school principal Kathy Scott sent an email to parents. Scott urged them to discourage their kids from participating. She said it is not OK for any student to be judged like that.


Katrina Foley, a Newport-Mesa Unified School District trustee, reacted quickly to the news by calling for district-wide ethics training for all students.

A tweet from one male participant proclaimed, "Many drafters on the prowl tomorrow for #freeagents so dress nice ladies." The tweet was taken down.


"Facts aren't fueling this fire. Feeling is what is fueling this fire, and until we express those feelings and those feelings are understood, we aren't going to get too far," said Daniel Watts, a Broadway performer who starred in a professionally choreographed Times Square flash mob in response to Eric Garner's death on Staten Island. He's also written two more spoken-word pieces about police brutality that others set to music.

Protest songs have not been heard in the United States since the 1960s. Then, singer and protester Pete Seeger helped make "We Shall Overcome" an important song of the 1960s civil rights movement. The civil rights movement fought for equal treatment of black people in the U.S.


Questlove, drummer for the hip-hop band the Roots, urged fellow musicians via Instagram and Twitter last week "to be a voice of the times that we live in," noting that "protest songs don't have to be boring or non-danceable."

Nephew wonders why music has not been a part of American protests since the 1960s. He thinks people are no longer used to singing together. Also, younger Americans are turned off by older songs about things that happened in the past.


"When I'm in my house I don't bother nobody and nobody bothers me," Cabrera said as he relaxed on his porch with his chubby brown Chihuahua, Dunko, an ashtray within arm's reach and a pack of Marlboro Lights in his pocket.

Luis Torres does not support the idea. He is 64 years old. Torres has lived in New York public housing for 44 years. He has been ticketed for smoking in the hallway, which is illegal. He doesn't smoke in his apartment because his son has asthma. He is upset about the ban. He doesn't want to be told what to do inside his own home.


The rule would ban lit tobacco products — cigarettes, cigars or pipes — in all residences, indoor common areas and administrative offices. Smoking also would be prohibited outdoors within 25 feet of buildings. Electronic cigarettes that emit vapor but not smoke would not be subject to the ban.

"That's private. You can do everything you want in your apartment," Torres said.


"I love you Mike. That's all I've got to say," Ewing said, standing on a stage behind a casket laden with red roses and a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap.

"Nobody is going to help us if we don't help ourselves," said Sharpton.


"Nobody is going to help us if we don't help ourselves," said Sharpton, challenging listeners to stop "sitting around having ghetto pity parties."

"I love you Mike. That's all I've got to say," Ewing said. He stood on a stage behind Brown's casket. The casket was piled with red roses and a St. Louis Cardinals baseball cap.


It was a message that resonated with the listeners.

"A fit — you get mad and run out for a couple of nights," Sharpton said. "A movement means we've got to be here for the long haul and turn our chance into change, our demonstration into legislation."


"I've got these two young boys to look after," she said. "This is a wake-up call for our young black men. I don't want them to be victims."

"A lot of people feel they could be next," said Chris Gray, 29. He came to the funeral from Minnesota. "There's a historic possibility here for young people to take ownership of a new civil rights movement."


"They think because they wear a badge, they hold life in their hands," said Demond Wright, 23, a dishwasher from Ferguson.

"The real question is how many days will pass before another unarmed black man is killed?" Parker said.


"It was not a proud time in his life, so it was only mentioned in passing, never in detail," Fong said. "I've asked all my relatives, and they say he never talked about it."




"It's perceived (by adults) as a more of a girl thing, but the kids just ignore it," said John Flanagan, owner of Learning Express Toys of Geneva Commons. His son Conor, 11, regularly sports an armful of bracelets, and at his soccer tournaments, almost every player wears a Rainbow Loom necklace in team colors, Flanagan said.

Seve Zdunek owns Learning Express Toys in Geneva. He told Angelo's mom that boys come in all the time. Parents buy nearly half of the Rainbow Looms for boys.


Authorities debriefed relatives of Rainier's latest victims Sunday, according to the father-in-law of one of the climbers. The man, who declined to give his name, said he had flown in from the East Coast on Friday night. His eyes were red and puffy as he grabbed a hasty lunch at Whittaker's Motel &amp; Historic Bunkhouse in Ashford, Wash., not far from the headquarters of Mount Rainier National Park. He said he hadn't eaten in two days. And he did not want to talk.

Climbing Rainier is always hard, and never easy.


"It's like being on a stair stepper at a steep angle for 10 hours, and that's for just a normal route," Grigg said. Liberty Ridge, the route the ill-fated climbers took last week, "is one of the most difficult on the mountain."

Eric Linxweiler has scaled Rainier several times. Climbers on the peak, he said, hear rocks crashing down the mountain.


"That ridge is steep enough and long enough that, once you get started falling, unless you can stop immediately, there's no stopping," Maude said.

More rational environmental policies would consider the costs and benefits of recycling programs and scrap those that are wasteful and harmful to the environment.

If recycling saved money, companies would be lined up to buy your trash. Do not bother looking because they are not there.


The amount of municipal solid waste produced annually in the United States has tripled since 1960, and in 2013, it totaled 254 million tons. That's 4.4 pounds per person every day.

We have gotten a lot better at handling garbage. People began recycling much more after the mid-1980s. Now, on average, Americans recycle about one-third of their trash.

But Sillett and other researchers working on an ambitious, four-year study found that growth rates of coastal redwoods and giant sequoia trees in California's old-growth forests increased during the 20th century, even as other parts of the Earth's environment — from polar bears to coral reefs — suffered from climate change.

## "An Incredibly Hopeful Story"


Dawson said although the trees are doing well now, the researchers found that redwood and sequoia seedlings die when soil moisture levels fall below 15 percent. So the project, which is seeking new funding, will need to study how seedlings and trees on the edges of the redwood range fare as climate continues to change, he said.

But does the company have to?

"We're not asking for this or that," he said. "If it's broccoli, tell us it's broccoli. If it's pork, tell us pork."


A year ago, King County Superior Court Judge Mary Yu granted Gate's request to dismiss the workers' lawsuit, saying state law does not require employers to accommodate religious practices.

A year ago, Washington judge Mary Yu threw out the Gate workers' lawsuit. She said state law does not force businesses to allow for religious practices.

Fuqua, who claims to have uncovered the disputed painting at a flea market outside Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, insists that she's entitled to it.

Fuqua is a former blackjack dealer who now teaches driving in Virginia. She has indicated that she plans to file a claim. Reporters could not reach her for comment and her attorney did not return a phone call.


The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in Paris on Friday that left 129 people dead and hundreds wounded.

States can "completely shut down these refugee relocation programs," Texas Governor Greg Abbott said. "The states are saying we are not going to accept any more of these refugees," he said. The government must first come up with a better way to spot terrorists, Abbott said.


Democrats did hold New Hampshire, where Senator Jeanne Shaheen turned back a strong challenge from former Senator Scott Brown. And they stopped the Republicans, at least for now, in Louisiana. Since no one got a majority, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu will face Republican Representative Bill Cassidy in a runoff next month.

## Anger At Obama


— Georgia. Perdue won the Republican nomination campaigning as an outsider who would shake up Washington, but Nunn gained by questioning his business record. Democrats had at least hoped no one would get a majority and the race would go to a Jan. 6 runoff. Instead, Perdue got enough to win outright. He'll succeed Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss.

In Kansas, Democrats appeared to be counting on Greg Orman. He did not run as a Democrat or a Republican. He ran as an independent. Orman was up against Senator Pat Roberts, a Republican. Democratic Vice President Joe Biden said he supported Orman on Tuesday but it wasn't enough. Roberts still won the spot in the Senate.


— West Virginia. Republican Representative Shelley Moore Capito won election as the state's first woman senator, defeating Democratic Secretary of State Natalie Tennant in a race that was never considered close. Capito will be the state's first female senator.

In Louisiana, the election was not yet clear. Three popular people were running in the southern state. Because the votes were split three ways, it was still not known who the winner will be. There will be a second election next month so the state can decide between Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, and Bill Cassidy, a Republican.


The PulsePoint app was the brainchild of Richard Price, former fire chief of the San Ramon Valley (California) Fire Protection District. It was developed through collaboration between the district and Northern Kentucky University, and uses citizen crowdsourcing to assist patients who suffer cardiac arrest.

A free app called 911HelpSMS informs a user of where he is located before he calls 911 in a medical emergency. It also instantly texts family members and gives them the person's GPS location.


But Helm said neither turned out to be a problem because citizen responders who assist during a medical emergency are protected from liability under Good Samaritan laws, which every state has enacted, and they're attending to victims in public places and aren't even aware of their names or other personal information.

Shannon Smith works for PulsePoint. She said that the app gives people who have been trained in CPR the ability to find someone who is in distress and to know where to find a defibrillator. This helps increase the chances of the patient surviving.


It's not clear why this happens, though psychologists have several theories.

##  Do You Remember The Way?


One explanation is that the return trip effect has to do with paying attention to time itself. When you pay more attention to time passing - let's say you're late, and keep checking your watch or phone - time seems to take forever. But when you're distracted by other, more interesting things, time passes quickly.

The study says that the "return-trip effect" has something to do with how people remember an event. To experience the effect, you need to know that you are making a return trip.


The conclusions of the 2011 study were that people are often too optimistic on their outbound journey, which makes that portion of the trip seem to take longer. On the way back, they revise their expectations too far the other direction. They expect the trip to be shorter than it actually is, which then it seems longer. According to the author of the study, this is why we don't experience the return-trip effect on our daily commute: We've taken the route so often that we have accurate expectations about how long it will take.

In a 2011 study, scientists asked people to ride bikes to a fair. They then split the group in half after they arrived. One group rode home on the same road that they took to get to the fair. The other group took a different way back, but it was exactly the same length as the first group. Both groups reported feeling the "return-trip effect."


"This is the most sophisticated management strategy devised," he said. "The conservation hunt is a hero in the hunting community."

"More than ridiculous," said Wayne Pacelle. He is the president of the Humane Society of the United States. "It's absurd. You're going to help an endangered animal by killing an endangered member of that population?"


Some animal preservation groups are bashing the idea.

## Rhino Hunted For Its Horn


Poachers long have targeted all species of rhino, primarily for its horn, which is valuable on the international black market. Made of the protein keratin, the chief component in fingernails and hooves, the horn has been used in carvings and for medicinal purposes, mostly in Asia. The near extinction of the species also has been attributed to habitat loss.

He called the auction the best way to preserve the rhino. "The conservation hunt is a hero in the hunting community."


Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal Welfare, disagreed, describing the club's argument as "perverse, to say the least."

Jackson said the rhino hunt will actually be a good thing. Killing an older, bad-tempered rhino means that more rhino calves will be born, he said.


Rick Barongi, director of the Houston Zoo and vice president of the International Rhino Foundation, said the hunt was not illegal but remained a complex idea that "sends a mixed message."

Ben Carter said money will mean a lot in the fight to protect the rhino. Carter is the president of the Safari Club.


Pacelle said the Humane Society would work to oppose the permit.

## Getting A Trophy Permit


"Because the alternative is you can lose them all," he said.
To get the permit to bring back the rhino, it must be killed as part of a well-managed program that protects the species.


"There's got to be a way to have real-time data on the animals, real-time data on the poachers and then a software system that enables us to mobilize people to get to the right place at the right time," Roberts said.

## Eyes In The Sky


The criminal syndicates have even tempted some of the people whose job it is to protect rhinos. In neighboring Mozambique, investigators think that rangers helped poachers kill all the rhinos in the section of the park that borders South Africa. Mozambique is widely considered the entry point for many of the poachers who enter South Africa.

## Math, Science And Saving Rhinos


"Before Richard III was king he was a notably loyal lieutenant to his brother, King Edward IV, keeping order in the north on behalf of the king. But when Edward IV died, Richard usurped the crown from his brother's 12-year old son, Edward V, justifying his actions on the spurious grounds that the boy and his brother were illegitimate. Later, Richard quite probably — although this is ultimately unproven — had Edward V and his brother murdered ...

Richard did not manage to get away and was killed by the soldiers of his rival, Henry Tudor.


That pollution means nearly all beaches dotting the 148-square-mile (383-square-kilometer) bay have long been abandoned by swimmers, and some health experts warn of risks to athletes who come into contact with the water. Elite sailors have warned that high-speed collisions with floating detritus could damage or even sink sailboats during the Olympics.

## Water Safe For Sailing?


Three mid-sized boats weighing 4 tons and with the capacity to hold 37 square feet (3.5 square meters) of trash began operating on Friday. Rented from a local firm, each mid-sized boat costs $842 daily to operate, including fuel and a three-person crew consisting of two sailors and a garbage collector. Serva said six small boats and one large barge will join them by March.

The boats don't deal with sewage. But authorities insist they'll make a big dent in the overall pollution.


Mario Moscatelli, a biologist and outspoken environmentalist, said that the eco-boats are a positive step in the right direction, but are too little, too late.

## A Call For "Eco-Barriers"


But scientists have only recently begun figuring out the life-and-death nuances of the currents. The 22 "data-logging drifters" that the team on the beach deployed Wednesday up the center of a weak rip current are thought to be the first ever used on the U.S. East Coast.

The way dangerous currents work seems straightforward: Water piles up between the beach and a sandbar in the ocean. A sandbar is a buildup of sand that is in a line. In a riptide, the water will find a low point in the sandbar and rush back out to sea. Sometimes swimmers are carried along with the flow.


One of the volunteers Wednesday was something of a celebrity in the world of coastal research — Rob Brander, who was visiting from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, as part of a multinational research trip.

One of the volunteers Wednesday was Ron Brander, a well-known scientist from Australia.


The formal recommendation for escaping rip currents has long been to swim parallel to the beach until you're out of the relatively narrow band of flowing water. That has been the theme of a national rip current awareness campaign that for more than a decade has been an international model.

## Stay Near A Lifeguard!


Car accidents killed more than 34,000 people last year on U.S. roadways, an increase from about 32,000 in 2011, according to NHTSA estimates. Human error causes more than 90 percent of auto accidents. Proponents of self-driving technology say computers can navigate roads better than people, who are much more error-prone than machines are.

## Should People Be Allowed To Drive?


MegaBots initiated the challenge, and Suidobashi accepted last month, but the American startup and its paintball-shooting machine are not quite ready for the speed and crushing hand-to-hand combat skills of the Japanese model, Kuratas, which sits on a wheeled tripod and carries a high-powered Gatling gun.

Kuratas can fight with its hands. Mk II is built to shoot its weapons from a distance. "It can't really take a punch or swing a punch," Oehrlein said.


"Right now, it has more in common with a vehicle than a robot," Cavalcanti said. "The lower half is almost entirely manual. But the final version of the robot will be much more autonomous."

## Bring On The Robot Battles


A partnership with San Rafael-based Autodesk, which makes engineering and construction software, inspired the co-founders to move MegaBots to the Bay Area this spring from Somerville, Massachusetts. They found the co-working studio in West Oakland, a hub for large-scale mechanical artistry, and used Autodesk's waterfront facility in San Francisco to weld the weaponry.

MegaBots started in Boston. The company moved to San Francisco to have a better place to build robots. It was hard to build big robots in Boston, Oehrlein said. There were not enough spaces to build properly. San Francisco has more buildings with room to do that, he said.


The team also wanted an abundant supply of tech talent as the company scales up and expands.

There is no reason to worry, Oehrlein and Cavalcanti say. It will always be just sport.

There's a moment in nearly every rodeo that reveals the first-timers in the crowd. Veteran hands know the moment, relish it, and it comes during calf roping.

That was it. A half-second and the show was over for Runyan.


Tenths of seconds matter: Runyan won last year by roping his first calf in 10 seconds flat. His next-closest competition came in at 10.70.

This is the way it is in rodeos. There is no showy victory lap. Just a handshake and a check, this one for $2,000.


Americans are regarded as enemies in North Korea since the two countries never signed a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. Thousands of U.S. troops are still based in South Korea, and the Demilitarized Zone between the North and South is one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world.

The Hall of Fame basketball player has been given the red-carpet treatment on each of his trips. But visiting North Korea for any high-profile American is risky and lots can go wrong. To keep the game itself friendly, the two sides will only play against each other in the first half, and then mix together in the second.


In Italy, the Roma are trotted out every time a government or a politician is in trouble, Tavani said. "Politicians see easy votes in vowing to rid Italy of these thieves, robbers and kidnappers," she said.

Hitler's Nazi Germany killed between 250,000 and 500,000 Roma. But people in Germany hardly stopped hating them after World War II.


The demonization of the Roma is hardly limited to Italy.

## Last Hired, First Fired


In Slovakia, city governments build walls around Gypsy camps. In the Czech Republic, neo-Nazis lead protests against their presence. Famously tolerant Norway banned outdoor camping in Oslo to keep homeless Roma away.

Romani Rose is head of a Roma council in Germany. Standing next to a year-old memorial to Romani victims of the Nazis, he said the hate remains widespread.


Martin Korol, a center-left politician from Bremen, recently said, "Roma come from an archaic world. … The prospect that they will ever contribute to the national product or pension funds is zero."

Cordula Simon, a Berlin government official, is eager to help Romani immigrants.


A far-right political party recently capitalized on those prejudices with the slogan "Geld fur die Oma, nicht fur Sinti und Roma," or "Money for Grandma, not Gypsies."

One of the most positive stories, she said, involves education. Young Roma children, many from desperately poor rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria, arrive in Berlin schools extremely unprepared. Many have never been to school before.


In the years since, green roofs have gotten a lot of attention, and Chicago has been recognized as one of the leaders in North America. The city has more than 5.5 million square feet on more than 500 rooftops, Strazzabosco said.

Washington officials said the city has 2.3 million square feet of green roofs. Philadelphia reported more than 1 million square feet.


A 1957 memo from civil rights organizer Bayard Rustin gives her talking points for a speech at the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom, an event held at the Lincoln Memorial that helped vault King onto the national stage.

Geraldine Hoff Doyle was the strong-armed model for the "We Can Do It" poster produced by Westinghouse Electric Corp. Doyle only worked for a few weeks in a military plant. She played the cello and realized how easily the work could damage her hands, Croston said.


One of the most recognizable is Geraldine Hoff Doyle, who was the strong-armed model for the "We Can Do It" poster produced by Westinghouse Electric Corp. But Doyle, a cellist, worked only a few weeks in a defense plant, stopping when she realized how easily it could damage her hands and music career, Croston said.

"She had the right name, the right job and was in the right place at the right time. You can't plan that," Croston said.


Monroe never profited from her "Rosie" role. She just considered it her patriotic duty, Croston said.

"The work they did was incredible. Can you imagine holding that 6.8-pound rivet hammer for eight hours?" said Nash. She noted that a modern rivet hammer weighs 2.5 pounds. Nash's grandmother was a "Rosie," who filed down metal parts in a plant.

## Putin Praises Athletes After Winter Games


In congratulating the medalists, Putin noted it was important for Russia to showcase not only its new modern sports facilities in Sochi but also its elite athletes, "those who are worthy of carrying the banner of its great and glorious traditions."

WADA said the athletes should be kept out of the next Olympics. The International Olympic Committee said any athletes who were doping will lose their medals.


The Russian ban on poultry is not a first. U.S. poultry was banned during the Bush administration in 2003 and 2004 when Russia objected to trade penalties levied against Russian steel. Poultry was again targeted briefly in 2010.

## "On Their Own People"


DONETSK, Russia—Tatiana Poludnitsina fled her home in the eastern Ukrainian town of Luhansk in her robe and flip-flops after artillery shells hit it in mid-August.

DONETSK, Russia— Tatiana Poludnitsina has nothing. All her belongings and papers were burned when her home in Ukraine was bombed last month.


The number of residents displaced within Ukraine doubled during three weeks in August to 260,000 since Jan. 1, the U.N. agency said. But the number is probably higher since many people were "staying with families and friends and had chosen not to register with the authorities," the agency said.

About 814,000 Ukrainians have entered Russia since the beginning of the year, according to the United Nations. Most of them seem to be Russian-speaking or have family ties to Russia.


Many of the refugees in Russia blame their plight on Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, President Barack Obama and leaders of other Western nations that have sided with the government in Kiev.

Refugees here defended the pro-Russia fighters. They claimed the rebels were ordinary citizens protecting the lives of Russians in Ukraine. They thanked the Russian government and its president, Vladimir Putin.


The morning after the opera I spent an hour with Gergiev, who has mostly avoided Western media, to get his side. He agreed as long as he would be allowed to put politics in the larger perspective of his musical priorities.

## A Long Friendship With Putin


For Gergiev this emphasis on tradition was also a reminder of what he calls the humanistic role of art. Russia in the post-Soviet era, he notes, needed then "as many leaders as possible to bring it back to normal."

## Performing Charity Concerts


"I do it without any contract," Gergiev explains. "There is no way to make a contract when you want to react to something that happened two days ago. I did that in the Beslan school bombing in the south of Russia," when Islamic extremists seized the school in 2004 and 318 hostages died, including 186 children.

"The Crimea issue is not something from five years ago or three years ago. You have to go back 200 years, 100 years," he says.

The Rwandan genocide was triggered April 7, 1994, when a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira, both Hutus, was shot down near the Kigali airport. The source of the attack is disputed, with Kagame's government saying that Hutu extremists in Habyarimana's military assassinated him as an excuse to exterminate Tutsis.

## People Left Unprotected


The downing of the plane undermined the peace deal and triggered the mass killing of Tutsis and some Hutus by Hutu extremists. Some of the perpetrators were radio hosts, who used their programs to call Tutsis "cockroaches" that should be exterminated.

In the Central African Republic, killings of Muslims by Christians have been taking place for months. A proposed U.N. force to halt the slaughter has yet to be sent.


Kagame speaks scathingly about the U.N. mission in eastern Congo, the largest in the world. "You have a (U.N. military) mission in Congo spending $1.5 billion every year for the past 12 years," he said in an interview last year. "Nobody every asks, 'What do we get out of this?'"

## Neat And Orderly


There was early evidence that Ryan might be the unifying force most Republicans hoped he would be.

## "We Are Adding" To Problems, Ryan Says


Boehner, who cast the final vote for Ryan, bid farewell by saying he leaves the House as "the same regular guy that came here" from the Cincinnati suburbs 25 years ago. He recited a list of his accomplishments, including major spending cuts, ending earmarks and preserving the D.C. school voucher program.

Following the vote, Ryan made a speech calling for unity among Republicans, and with the Democrats.


"I leave with no regrets, no burdens," he said.

"Let's pray for each other, Republicans for Democrats, and Democrats for Republicans," he said. "Pray for a deeper understanding."


Webster, in an interview, said Ryan is "hoping he gets a semi-pass" on the spending bill "because it's been sort of dumped on him."

Brownback said Ryan has an important job. He has the power to help decide what problems the next president would work on, if a Republican wins.


JERUSALEM — The crowd that gathered at the recent grand opening of Cinema City hadn't come for the movies. They were there in droves to protest a government regulation that keeps the 19-screen multiplex closed each week from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.

JERUSALEM — A crowd chanted "Jerusalem, wake up! Nonreligious people are equal too!" Guards blocked them from entering a new movie theater.


"When I see a Jewish person in a car on the Sabbath, it hurts me," said Daniel Katzenstein, an ultra-Orthodox father of nine who moved to Jerusalem from Brooklyn. "Any threat to my lifestyle I am going to protest."

Wharton is a city councilwoman. Her secular political party led the protest outside the new 19-screen multiplex. The theater was built on city land. It may not show movies on the Sabbath, according to a rule written by an ultra-Orthodox lawmaker. A small number of people are "telling the rest of the city what they should do," she said.


"There's a lack of tolerance here, the feeling like you're not welcome," said Elisheva Mazya, who runs a nonprofit called New Spirit that works to keep young people living in Jerusalem by helping them find jobs and obtain mortgages. Her group has tried to block ultra-Orthodox families from moving to certain neighborhoods so the streets there can remain open on the Sabbath.

Most of West Jerusalem, which is mainly Jewish, shuts down every Friday afternoon. Stores are closed, bus service is stopped, and cars are blocked from streets in and around Orthodox neighborhoods. Sometimes the ultra-Orthodox throw stones at drivers who break the Sabbath.


For Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, who is secular, running the city has been a balancing act. He has tried to stay out of the fray on issues such as whether Cinema City should be allowed to open during the Sabbath while putting a priority on attracting secular young people, whom he calls "the engine for growth."

More than 60 percent of ultra-Orthodox men study at religious schools. They do not work, and few of them serve in the army. In Israel, most young people serve in the army. Israeli families receive money from the government based on the number of children. And the ultra-Orthodox tend to have many children.


"I hope that we can be together not just in the workplace but everywhere," she said. "But it's a process."
"We feel everyone's against us," she said, adding that cooperation is possible.


They said they have been denied formal consultations over an animal that was once widespread across their ancestral homelands. Consultations on matters affecting tribes are required under treaty obligations and prior White House executive orders.

"They have a very deep connection to the land and the animals and the environment," she said. "We certainly want to respect that."


"We need to hear from them on when and where we can meet, because we are ready to meet at any time," Baker said.
"These are our treaty lands, our ancestral homelands," said Lee Juan Tyler, a leader of the Shoshone Bannock Tribes. "We want the grizzly bear protected with those lands."


"On the advice of my counsel, my outside counsel, we are accepting applications for marriage but we are not processing any right now," said Judge Tim Russell in Baldwin County.

On Feb. 9, the Supreme Court declared that it would not stop Granade's order. With that ruling the court has opened the way for gay marriage in Alabama.


Ecstatic couples received marriage licenses in scenes similar to those in many other states that had legalized same-sex marriage. Some had been waiting for hours.

Judge Tim Russell in Baldwin County said he would accept requests from same-sex couples looking to get married. However, he added, he would not be willing to marry any gay couples at the moment.


In Birmingham, a marriage license went to Dee and Laura Bush, who have been together seven years and have five children between them.

"It's about time," said Shante Wolfe, 21. She and Tori Sisson of Tuskegee had camped out in a blue and white tent and became the first in Montgomery County to receive a marriage license.


In Montgomery, a police spokesperson responded to questions about protests and arrests with, "Protests about what?"

The Bible does not permit marriage between a man and a man or a woman and a woman, he said.


At the southern end of the state, in coastal Fairhope, the Rev. Jerry Henry sat in a study lined with books such as Biblia Hebraica and Analytical Greek New Testament, pondering what the changes might mean for the church.

"He was at a juncture," said Robert H. Hirst, general editor and official curator at the Mark Twain Project and Papers housed in the University of California, Berkeley's Bancroft Library, where he has worked intimately with Twain's legacy since 1967. "Even when he's in Angels Camp, he still has not made up his mind to make his career in literature. And he's not going to make that leap until he is forced to, economically."

The frog story turned out to be a huge hit — Twain had finally struck gold.


"Our president doesn't want to use the term," he said. "But it turns out it probably was related — radical Islamic terrorism."

There are many different kinds of Islam. Most have nothing to do with fighting, and most Muslims are peaceful.


White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that Obama was not backing off his push to drive a conversation about gun measures. White House lawyers are continuing to search for ways Obama can expand required background checks without congressional approval. Earnest argued that the shooters in San Bernardino, regardless of their motives, could have been stopped if the gun laws were changed.

By Thursday, both Obama and Trump were talking differently about Wednesday's attack. Other Democrats and Republicans were speaking differently about it also.


"All the themes we see underneath these events, that's one thing that really has to get addressed," House Speaker Paul Ryan, (R-Wis.) said Thursday morning on MSNBC's "Morning Joe." Ryan was cautious not to label the shooting, before the facts were known.

On Thursday, the president chose his words carefully. He asked for patience and told Americans they were safe. He did not call for gun control as strongly as he usually does.


In populous Southern California, immigration agents have tended to work more closely with sheriff's departments that run the county jails, where most serious offenders wind up. Smaller city jails like the one in Huntington Beach usually serve as short-term holding centers for misdemeanor arrests.

Last year, some cities stopped holding immigrants in jail because of the Oregon decision. In response, immigration officials said they would not ask police to keep a person in jail. Instead, they would ask police to let them know when an immigrant will get released. Then the immigration officials could arrest him or her for coming to the U.S. illegally.


At first glance, the irascible Sanders seems like a strange fit for the platform, where users can send photos and short videos to their friends that later evaporate. "What is this Snapshot thing and why do I only get 10 seconds?" Sanders tweeted on Monday to announce his new account. He's a late adopter: His Democratic rivals, Martin O'Malley and Hillary Clinton, have been on the platform for several weeks, as has every major Republican candidate except Jeb Bush, Donald Trump and Rick Santorum.

## It's SnapCHAT, Not SnapSHOT!


In comparison, Clinton, who joined in early August, has been praised for her amusing account, which often features throwback photos of the candidate or images mocking her Republican opponents.

Sanders's first story featured scenes from a speech he gave. His second story was about his plan for immigration. Immigrants are people who move to the United States. His stories are very serious.


"We believe that these young people who are now supporting him in very large numbers can be persuaded to participate in large numbers as well," Devine said, "and that can make a huge difference in terms of the outcome."
"I think a lot of the things that he says are things that people our age believe in," Smith said. "And he's the only one who's really just saying them."


Devine said that a big advantage of Sanders' style of raising money is that he can return again and again to the same donors for additional contributions, given that most of them are giving well under the $2,700 limit for the campaign cycle.

Devine said the Sanders campaign decided not to try to compete with Clinton in one area. It will not match Clinton's spending on television ads early in the campaign. It wants to save money for when it needs it. "We wanted to have as big a pile of cash on hand," he said.

CUPERTINO, Calif. — Almost nothing can scratch it, yet it responds keenly to human touch. And it oozes the luxury feel that Apple craves.

CUPERTINO, Calif. —  Apple is putting a lot of money into sapphire. The company isn't buying up the precious gem. Instead, it just signed a $578 million deal with another tech company to make artificial sapphire crystals. Experts think that man-made sapphire will soon be used in Apple touch-screens.


A spokesman for Corning, which manufactures Gorilla Glass, defended the product's durability and sensitivity. And experts note that the toughness of sapphire depends on the cut, meaning a screen made from the mineral might not necessarily hold up better than one made of Gorilla Glass.

Apple has been using Gorilla Glass in its iPhones. A screen made of sapphire would likely be tougher to scratch or crack than Gorilla Glass. Sapphire's hardness could be a strong selling point with customers. Nearly one out of 10 iPhone users have a device with a cracked screen, says SquareTrade. The company sells insurance for electronic devices.


The technology could also make Apple products more accessible to the nursery set. Although many young children have an affinity for technology, touch-screen devices with glass screens do not always pick up on their tiny fingers, Hsu said.

A sapphire screen could improve the experience of "gaming, typing and playing instruments in apps like Garage Band," says Carolina Milanesi, a technology expert.


It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California's sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world's top fishing ports.

## Sea Lions, Brown Pelicans Hurting


Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service.

## A Night Without A Bite


Melin's research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.

Hanson is an example of how fishermen have been affected. Just a few years ago, Hanson didn't have to travel far from shore to find sardines. He'd pull in nets overflowing with sardines.


"We are likely to see more local events like this if sardines disappear or redistribute along the coast and into deeper water," said Selina Heppell, a fisheries ecologist at Oregon State University.

Not anymore. If his crew catches sardines now, they are larger, older fish. They are mostly shipped overseas and ground up for pet or fish food. Largely absent are the small and valuable young fish that can be sold for bait or canned and eaten.


"If the new SAT succeeds, it will be the first time America is able to systematically shape the views, beliefs and ideologies of hundreds of thousands of Chinese students every year, not through a popular television show or a politician's speaking tour, but through what the Chinese care about most — exams," she wrote.

## The Test Will Go On


Opponents of the ban say it means families have to employ expensive private drivers and makes it difficult for women to work or to do many other basic daily tasks.

## Religious Conservatives Clamp On The Brakes


The hajj, a central pillar of Islam and one that able-bodied Muslims must make once in their lives, is a four-day spiritual cleansing based on centuries of interpretation of the traditions of Prophet Muhammad.

## "Here I Am, God"


The tradition of banning women from driving is rooted in the kingdom's hard-line interpretation of Islam known as Wahabbism, with critics warning that women driving could unravel the very fabric of Saudi society.

No laws prevent women from driving in Saudi Arabia. But, the government won't give them drivers' licenses. Many of the women who drove last weekend had licenses from other countries.


Rights activist and campaigner Ali al-Hattab from the coastal city of Jiddah said the monarchy uses the religious establishment's opposition to keep women from driving.

Alaa Wardi of Riyadh says he is not involved in the fight. But, he has produced an online video called "No Woman, No Drive." It uses a Bob Marley song to make fun of comments by a famous sheik, or religious leader, who said driving can harm a woman's ovaries. It has had more than 8 million views so far.


The activists have been careful not to gather for fear of being accused of organizing a protest. Instead, they work independently in several cities to edit and upload the videos and help manage the campaign's website and Twitter and YouTube accounts.

"He is well and healthy," al-Qassem said.


Two women said they were followed by undercover agents, while five others said they were contacted by the Interior Ministry and told not to drive.

## "Women Will Drive"


Many couples, including Alkhudair and his wife, are finding that they need two incomes to afford the lifestyle they want. At the same time, companies are under pressure to hire Saudis to fill quotas demanded by the government before they can employ foreign workers to fill posts that locals either are not qualified for or consider too menial.

It can still be very hard for Saudi women to find jobs. Many companies do not want to hire women. Their bosses are old-fashioned and think women should stay at home.


Nevertheless, Saudi women's basketball is on the rise, and women from the ultraconservative kingdom are even playing in other Arab countries. Hadeer Sadagah, 20, started playing eight years ago with Almaeena at Jiddah United. She now plays at the collegiate level for the University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates.

## The Running Rebels


There's also a strong conservative sentiment against women playing sports. Well-known clerics have spoken out against sports like basketball, saying the exertion could tear a woman's hymen and cause her to lose her virginity. Others argue that sports blur gender lines and make women more masculine.

The sport has grown into a network of teams in different cities. No proper league exists. Women's teams play in private tournaments.


It makes sense that Jiddah would become the incubator for women's basketball in Saudi Arabia. The coastal city is easily the country's most liberal and cosmopolitan. Jiddah's residents are a melting pot of ethnicities whose ancestors settled along an ancient trade and pilgrimage route, unlike the largely tribal roots of other Saudis. The result has been a distinct and more open culture than Saudi cities like the capital, Riyadh.

Women often struggle to find places to train. They are not allowed to attend matches in stadiums.


None of the companies work with drivers who use their personal cars to convey passengers at a fraction of the cost of a taxi or limousine service, a practice that has stirred conflict with transportation operators and regulators elsewhere. In Saudi Arabia, they say, they get their cars and drivers from licensed companies and charge comparable rates.

And it looks just like she is in an ordinary car.


San Francisco-based Uber, which operates in more than 300 cities in 56 countries around the world, entered the fray a year ago. In that time, the number of users has increased twentyfold, one of the fastest growth rates in the Middle East or Europe, said Majed Abukhater, who serves as the company's regional general manager.

Mudassir Sheikha owns Careem. He says his company is trying to follow rules and offer a better service.


Late last year, the transportation committee of the Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it was looking into the operations of several apps, which it accused of using drivers who were not authorized to carry customers in the kingdom — charges denied by Uber and Careem.

"There are some (women) that take five to 10 trips with us every day," Sheikha said. "We don't see that kind of traffic anywhere."


"There are some (women) that take five to 10 trips with us every day," Sheikha said. "We don't see that kind of traffic anywhere."

Radwan and her husband do not use a driver because they are expensive.


In the 2011-2012 school year, black students represented about 16 percent of the student population, but accounted for 27 percent of all student referrals to law enforcement, and 31 percent of school-related arrests, according to a federal report from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.

There are no national rules for training school police, said Mo Canady. He is the head of the National Association of School Resource Officers. School police are usually called resource officers. When they are trained well and work closely with school officials, arrests in schools go down rather than up, he said.


At least three students who were in the classroom at Spring Valley High said the teacher tried to discipline the unidentified student for looking at her phone.

The deputy drags the student. He throws her across the classroom, the videos show.


There's also a financial incentive for districts to expand breakfast. The federal government reimburses schools for each meal served. At LA Unified, the number of participating children has grown from 29 percent to 81 percent in three years, generating an additional $16 million, according to Laura Benavidez, the district's deputy director of food services.

## Missing Learning Time


Parents at UCLA Community School, where Ramos' children attend, also organized. They said the initiative took away instructional time from low-income and English-learner students, a group that scores persistently lower in reading and math. They also worried about unsanitary classrooms. The district temporarily delayed implementation but plans to soon start breakfast in the classroom at the school.

## The Cafeteria Is For Eating


The guidelines are not the first administration action regarding tough-on-crime laws or policies of the 1980s and '90s that have lost support more broadly since then. Holder announced last summer that he was instructing federal prosecutors to stop charging nonviolent drug offenders with crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences, a change affecting crack cocaine sentences that have disproportionately affected minorities. And just before Christmas, President Barack Obama commuted the sentences of eight people serving long drug sentences.

## Looking At Zero-Tolerance Rules


James said he hopes the administration's effort will provide leverage for districts with parents, teachers and communities.

Saying "that educators are discriminating against kids across the country" is "inappropriate," Hinson said. "If there are problem areas that need to be addressed, you address those areas."


The school district in Buffalo, New York, adopted a new code of conduct to reduce suspensions after a 15-year-old, Jawaan Daniels, died in a drive-by shooting in 2010 as he left school to begin serving an out-of-school suspension for wandering the halls of school.

And in Miami last November, Broward County Public Schools agreed to create an alternative to zero-tolerance rules. The goal was to stop kids from ending up in prison.

The idea is either horrible or innovative, depending on whom you ask. Critics say it adversely affects students' education. Supporters say it makes teachers better. Students? A senior girl shrugged and said she was looking forward to sleeping in an extra day.

## "Our Teachers Love It"


In North Carolina, the state Senate's proposed budget called for cutting 70 of the 260 school nurses hired with state funds. State lawmakers are still working to hammer out an agreement between the House and Senate versions of the budget.

North Carolina has about 1,200 school nurses. Most of them are paid by local school districts. And they care for students in more than one school. There are more school nurses than 10 years ago. But even more nurses are needed, said Cheryl Blake. Blake serves as president of the School Nurse Association of North Carolina.


Saurer, who founded N.C. Parents Advocating for School Health, said the additional county money to pay for more school nurses will mean Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will have one nurse for every 900 students. The county commission approved the budget this month.

"Sometimes a school nurse is a child's only health provider," said Tina Gordon. She is the head of the North Carolina Nurses Association. "They can catch things early and perhaps treat them in the school. That's much less expensive than the emergency room."

"This critical report shows that racial disparities in school discipline policies are not only well documented among older students, but actually begin during preschool," Attorney General Eric Holder said. "Every data point represents a life impacted and a future potentially diverted or derailed. This administration is moving aggressively to disrupt the school-to-prison pipeline in order to ensure that all of our young people have equal educational opportunities."

"It is clear that the United States has a great distance to go to meet our goal of providing opportunities for every student to succeed," Education Secretary Arne Duncan said.


Daniel Losen, director of the Center for Civil Rights Remedies for the Civil Rights Project at UCLA, said the findings are disturbing because the suspended preschoolers are unlikely to be presenting a danger, such as a teenager bringing a gun to school.

Reggie Felton helps run the National School Boards Association. He called the situation "unacceptable." He said there's more training going on to ensure teachers are aware of the importance of keeping students in school.


"I think most people would be shocked that those numbers would be true in preschool, because we think of 4- and 5-year-olds as being innocent," she said. "But we do know that schools are using zero tolerance policies for our youngest also, that while we think our children need a head start, schools are kicking them out instead."
Judith Browne Dianis co-directs the Advancement Project, a group that specializes in social issues affecting minority communities. The findings came as no surprise to her.


WASHINGTON — It used to be that when children hopped onto a yellow school bus to get to and from their classes, taxpayers picked up the tab.

WASHINGTON — Most students on big yellow school buses are getting a free ride. The money that pays for the driver, the bus and the gas to run it comes from tax dollars. People pay taxes to their state. Then the state government gives money to schools.


Fees vary from district to district. The Jeffco Public Schools in Golden, Colorado, for example, charge $150 a child per year. Students in grades 7 through 12 in Franklin, Massachusetts, pay $325 each, with a cap of $975 per family. And the Poway Unified School District in San Diego County, California, bills $575 a year per child, with a cap of $1,437 for three or more children.

## Traffic Jams Outside Schools


"This is complex, but as a parent and a principal, I truly believe it behooves us to be thoughtful about our next steps here so that we can have a diverse student council that is truly representative of all voices at Everett," she wrote.

Todd David is a parent at the school. His son Noah is in eighth grade. David said that what the principal did was wrong. He said it showed students that their choice may not matter.


Not surprisingly, when kids were offered sauteed broccoli in garlic and olive oil or vegetable soup instead of hideous piles of indistinguishable greens, they tended to eat more of the healthful food, said Juliana Cohen, a research associate in the school's nutrition department.

## Tasty Food Was More Popular


The cost of middle school lunches packed at home averaged $1.76, less than the $2.05 that they would have had to pay to buy lunch at school.

## What To Do?


"It's not about government standards," Kansas Republican Senator Pat Roberts said in a speech to the association's members as they wrapped up their lobbying efforts Wednesday. "It's about taking the opportunity to make government programs work for the people and not the other way around."

## What's It All About?


In Roberts' home state, nearly 15 percent of 10- to 17-year-olds are obese, as are 30 percent of adults, according to a report by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

## Stacking The Lunch Trays


Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota, announced Monday that he plans to introduce a bill endorsed by the School Nutrition Association that would amend the sodium and whole-grain rules.

USDA spokesman Cullen Schwarz said the department has shown flexibility in the timing and implementation of the school lunch rules. He also said the USDA has done so without the need for legislation.


The idea is to give students a rehearsed response aimed at halting bullying instantly. For example, a student who sees someone bullying another could walk up to the aggressor and say, "Stop," or use a hand signal and then tell a teacher.

Under the program, schools know that any student may bully others and be bullied themselves.  Students help point out problems at their schools. All teachers and students are trained in a program called "Stop, Walk and Talk." They learn exactly what they should say and do to stop bullying.


Soon after the forum, administrators from all eight schools in Bloomingdale's Community Consolidated School District 93 adopted a multitiered plan that now includes an Expect Respect Club at some schools, where kids wear brightly colored T-shirts emblazoned with the logo.

"There aren't any quick, easy solutions that are going to happen after one hour or an afternoon," she said.


Some districts have combined or closed low-enrollment schools, forcing families that stay put to send their kids on longer bus rides on mountain highways to the next-closest classroom. Chain-link fences now surround empty schools that had served as gathering places in some small communities, hosting potlucks, pancake breakfasts and even doubling as support centers during mining disasters.

Many families have moved away from the area. The kids who stay have to ride along mountain highways to the next-closest classroom. Fences surround empty schools.


During the pilot project in Thurston County, engineers are inspecting each school, looking for structural weaknesses and hazards like bookshelves that aren't bolted to the wall. Those observations will be combined with the data Cakir and his team are gathering on how solid — or shaky — the ground is at each site.

Leaders in the state of Oregon checked their schools this year. They found that over 1,000 school buildings might fall in a big earthquake. Oregon is paying to fix the buildings.


Not as a replacement for recess or PE, but school systems instead were asked to develop new and innovative cardio programs to weave into an already time-pressed day.

## Yoga Before First Bell


"We're preparing more students for college and helping parents in the pocketbook when it comes time for college tuition," said Long Beach Unified spokesman Chris Eftychiou.

"It's a delicate balancing act," said Shelly Tan. Her son, Douglas, failed to get into an AP biology class after doing the summer work during a family vacation. "Yes, you want to give all kids opportunity — but not at the expense of kids who can do the honors work."

The Obama administration still supports annual standardized tests as a necessary assessment tool, and both House and Senate versions of an update to the No Child Left Behind law would continue annual testing. But the rewrite legislation would let states decide how to use test results to determine what to do with struggling schools. Differences between the two bills still need to be worked out.

## President Wants Limits On Testing


That's a break from the long and controversial history of what some critics have called the military-entertainment complex, a close association between the armed forces and Hollywood that more or less made the Defense Department a gatekeeper for action movies. After "Top Gun," the columnist David Sirota explains, the Pentagon shrewdly began using its cooperation as a kind of leverage against filmmakers. If your script didn't portray the troops in a favorable light, you could forget about getting access to the ships, tanks and bases that served as your props and sets.

## Oops, We Forgot Him On Mars!


Johnson also illustrates the poems with simple watercolors, ranging from a sunlit iceberg to smokestacks and a swing set on a grassy slope. The latter is paired with the verse:

_Glaciers and ice sheets  




melt worldwide, speed increasing  


_Forty years from now  

Sea ice, snow retreat_


In a way, it is a return to classical tradition. Through much of history, artists were scientists, a role epitomized by Leonardo da Vinci. Only within the last 200 years have the two diverged into separate academic disciplines.

## Math And Music


"People have been waiting for decades. It's this masterwork they've never been able to experience," said Sean Malone, CEO and president of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. "They've seen photos and can see it from outside, but they've never been able to come inside. Frank Lloyd Wright buildings are visceral and meant to be experienced."

## Come On In!


The two floors opening for tours have been returned to the glory of their product development days — cabinets restored to the original Cherokee Red paint along with beakers, flasks, centrifuges, balances, test tubes and graduated cylinders set out on counter tops as if the folks who invented Off! had just stepped out for a coffee break.

The opening is creating quite a stir. This is partly because of the tower's beautiful design, but also because it has never been open for tours.


Because visitors must walk up a narrow circular stairway, the tower is not wheelchair accessible.

## Bright Lights, Big Ideas


However, with polls suggesting that as many as 40 percent of families are divided over the referendum — and with at least 20 percent saying the debate has led to heated family arguments — the art of friendly persuasion has not exactly been easy.

## Voting For The First Time


The Better Together camp says older voters have a wealth of experience to impart on younger ones.

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said the Generation Yes campaign was 'inspired.' He said young voters now have a great excuse to visit their grandparents' house for meals.


"I urge you to use both your vote and your voice to remind your children and grandchildren of suffering endured together, sacrifices made together and achievements earned together with friends, neighbors and relatives in England, Wales and Northern Ireland," Brown said. "Tell them how we fought and won two world wars together."

"My Dad stopped talking to me when I said I was going to vote Yes," said 21-year-old student Laura Brown. "He even blocked me as a friend on Facebook."


For his part, Cameron — aware that his Conservative Party is widely loathed in Scotland — begged voters not to use a vote for independence as a way to bash his party.

"There is not a cemetery in Europe that does not have Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lined side by side," Brown said in his final speech before the vote. "We not only won these wars together, we built the peace together."


All the while, though, justice remained undone for some of the boys as they became men, went into hiding, and eventually died with the stigma of rape on their reputations. That changed only after a long campaign by a Scottsboro woman.

Pardoning the Scottsboro Boys means the men had their names cleared.


"An old, thin paperback," she said Thursday. A book about nine boys who were black, like her. What she read changed her life.

## Reputations Ruined


In 1978, her brother died in Kilby Prison, where the boys had been held. Guards had killed him, she said, after he had killed a white man in a fight.

A fight started, and the outnumbered white boys jumped off and went to the police. In Paint Rock, Ala., officers boarded the train. They arrested every black male, ranging from 13 to 19 years old. They also found the two white girls, who claimed they had been attacked.


After almost two decades of work she opened the Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center on Willow Street, where visitors could learn about the case out in the open, free of plastic wrap and pillowcases.

Sheila Washington's father caught her as she read the boys' story and he snatched the book from her hands. She heard fear in his voice. "You don't need to know about that," he said. "Just keep quiet about this now."


At the court, Chief Justice John Roberts again voted with his liberal colleagues in support of the law. Roberts also was the key vote to uphold it in 2012. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a dissenter in 2012, was part of the majority on Thursday.

Representative John Boehner is a Republican lawmaker from Ohio. He said Republicans will continue their efforts to reverse the law. The Republicans oppose Obama's Democratic Party. They do not think the government should require people to have health insurance or make health insurance cheaper.


Nationally, 10.2 million people have signed up for health insurance under the Obama health overhaul. That includes the 8.7 million people who are receiving an average subsidy of $272 a month to help pay their insurance premiums.

Justice Antonin Scalia strongly disagreed.


He said the Civil Rights Act of 1964 puts the legal burden on employers not to discriminate. It gives "favored treatment" to religion, he said, and "religious practice is one of the protected characteristics ... that must be accommodated."

In court, the clothing company said it wanted all its workers to have a certain "look." After all, it is a clothing store. The look it wants simply does not include wearing a headscarf.


Carlene Benz, a spokeswoman for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, denied that the company had discriminated against Elauf and said the retailer allowed workers to wear headscarves when requested for religious reasons.

From now on, workers and job seekers will not have to ask for a "religious accommodation," said lawyer Michael Droke. It will be up to companies to make accommodations whether they are asked or not.


Even though the Civil Rights Act has been on the books since 1964, the Supreme Court has said remarkably little about its protection against religious discrimination. The law is better known for banning racial discrimination by schools, colleges, employers and businesses.

The Supreme Court's decision on Monday was based on the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The act says businesses may not "refuse to hire" someone because of their "race, color, religion, sex or national origin."


The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces the law, sued on Elauf's behalf. A federal judge ruled that she was a victim of illegal discrimination and a jury awarded her $20,000 in compensation.

Thomas said the company's dress rules covered all workers equally. Wanting a particular person to follow those rules is not discrimination, he argued.

The ruling ends a 12-year-old lawsuit by a Jerusalem-born American, Menachem Zivotofsky, and his U.S. citizen parents.

The White House has refused to recognize any nation's control over Jerusalem. It wants to wait until Israelis and Palestinians settle their disagreement.


Justice Antonin Scalia read a summary of his dissent from the bench, saying the Constitution "divides responsibility for foreign affairs between Congress and the president." Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito joined the dissent.

Justice Anthony Kennedy was one of the six judges who voted to strike down the law. He said that the president has the sole power to recognize foreign nations. Recognition of a country involves accepting that country's right to control a particular territory. Part of the president's power of recognition is the right to determine what a passport says.


In a separate dissent, Roberts cast the court's decision as dangerously groundbreaking. "The court takes the perilous step — for the first time in our history — of allowing the president to defy an act of Congress in the field of foreign affairs," Roberts wrote.

"Recognition is a topic on which the nation must speak with one voice. That voice must be the president's," Kennedy wrote.


"If the environment is really bad and adult females can't find food, then a young pup that doesn't really have experience feeding itself is going to have trouble, too," Melin added.

Keith Matassa is the director of the mammal center. "That is a high number, but it shows there is something wrong out in the wild," said Matassa.


By performing a series of calculations on the pup count number, he can come up with an estimate for the entire sea lion population.

## Warm Water Disturbs Feeding Cycles


In recent years, as ocean conditions have changed, the sardine and anchovy populations have collapsed. And fishing may be exacerbating the problem.

—Diet: Squid, anchovies, mackerel, rockfish and sardines


"I only do this for important events, like the Seahawks (Super Bowl championship) parade and the Gum Wall," she said, after whipping a bottle of hand sanitizer out of her purse and handing it around to her Seahawks-clad children.

## Gum Selfies And Bridal Portraits


Allison Hazen and Philip Prahst, transplants from the Midwest, swooped into the gum alley on an August day in 2012, a time of year when gum is at its goopiest. It was their wedding day, she trailed a long white gown, and they wanted to commemorate the moment with a backdrop of Hubba Bubba and Trident.

Leonard Garfield runs Seattle's Museum of History & Industry. Before the wall was finished being cleaned, he was asked if he thought the wall would remain gum-free.


Katie Benmar, a sophomore, doesn't think the new start time will make anything better. She expects her life will just shift one hour later — from after-school activities to dinner to homework and bed.

Bridget Shelton is a freshman at Seattle's Roosevelt High School. She thinks the change in start times will help her get more sleep. This year, she sleeps six to seven hours a night. Next year, she hopes to get eight hours a night.  


Attendance has dropped the most at the San Diego location, and the decision to end orca shows will be limited for now to that park, the original home of Shamu, its first orca.

SeaWorld is based in Orlando, Florida. The company is not doing as well as it used to. It has not made as much money since a 2013 movie came out. The movie is called "Blackfish." It looks at how orcas react to being confined. It also described the case of Tilikum. The killer whale caused the death of a trainer in 2010 by pulling her into a pool at SeaWorld Orlando.


The killer whale shows at the Shamu stadium in San Diego were the park's main draw in the 1970s and helped build SeaWorld as a top tourist attraction. Trainers would ride the whales in the giant pool before getting out and signaling for the orca to slap its tail in the water to splash spectators in a "splash zone."

Also, fewer people are visiting the SeaWorld parks. The San Diego park has seen the biggest drop. Orcas shows will be stopped only in San Diego. They will continue at the other two SeaWorld parks in Orlando and San Antonio, Texas.


The new plans did not impress a main critic of SeaWorld's orca program, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), which has called for the orcas to be put in large-scale ocean sanctuaries.

## "Bigger Prison Is Still A Prison"


The Orlando-based company also conceded for the first time that attendance at its theme parks has been hurt by negative publicity caused by a drumbeat from animal rights activists about the alleged maltreatment of the orcas.

## Orca Show Its Most Popular


A petition on change.org has collected more than 220,000 signatures, calling for SeaWorld Orlando to release a whale featured in "Blackfish," Tilikum, to a sea pen.

## Unhappy Ending For "Free Willy" Orca


Dold, SeaWorld's chief veterinarian, said sea pens can also expose whales to viruses passed on through other fish in the pens or toxins and oil spills that wash in with the tide.

Ingrid Visser started the Orca Research Trust. It is a group dedicated to the study of orcas. "We can put a man on the moon, surely we can move an animal out of a concrete life," she said.

His capture after vaulting the fence was a bit of good news for the agency, which has been pilloried since last month when a man with a knife in his pocket scaled the fence, ran across the lawn and got inside the White House before he was apprehended. President Barack Obama had just left for Camp David when the man jumped the fence.

Adesanya was unarmed at the time of his arrest. He was treated at a local hospital for dog bites.


People who replace even half an hour of sedentary time with 30 minutes of light activity can improve their health, researchers said. Stand-up bingo, anyone?

This is true no matter how much exercise a person gets, concluded the researchers. The study was published Wednesday in the Journal of Physical Activity &amp; Health. Researchers came from four universities and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


"A sedentary lifestyle is associated with a variety of poor health outcomes, including increased incidence for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality," the researchers wrote. But many people may have thought they'd done what they needed to if they met the government suggestion of 150 minutes a week of moderate activity.

## Get Up And Go


The people in that sample spent almost nine waking hours a day sedentary, and 3.6 percent of them reported disability in their activities of daily living. The average waking time was 14 hours.

Apparently not so.


That's not to suggest there's no value in moderate exercise, which they said is an inexpensive way to be healthier and reduce health care costs. But the current study is looking "at a very different question," which is how people stay independent, out of nursing homes and able to fend for themselves, Semanik said.

## The Couch Question


But they wrote, "Even a large daily dose of moderate-vigorous activity may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects of a sedentary lifestyle."
So how much coach potato time is OK?


"We're not people who run around with signs saying 'Repent, the end is near,'" Fowler told the Atlantic in 2012. "... You don't have to have some kind of global catastrophe for this thing to be useful. We're losing biodiversity right now, and it isn't necessarily because of some global catastrophe."

## Guarding Against Disaster


Buying sexy, fast cars for garages could evolve into buying seat-miles in appliance-like pods, piloted by robots, parked in public stalls.

## Fast Cars And Horses


Certainly, there are skeptics.

## We Love Our Cars


Then, he said, skeptics asked: "Why would any rational person want to replace the assuredness of that hot horse body trustily pulling your comfortable carriage with an unreliable, oil-spurting heap of gears, belts and chains?"

## Computers Will Run The Show


Automakers that survive will shift most of their business to create transit companies, or to selling their vehicles to those who do.

Cars will slowly, steadily take over more of the driving, Schwartz said.


"New mobility, car sharing, ride sharing, what does that mean for us? We are thinking through that," Mark Fields, Ford's chief executive, said at a recent investor conference. "We are thinking like a car and truck company, but we are also thinking like a mobility company."

"The robot will take over," Wardle said. "In the end, people will think: Why am I even bothering to drive at all?"

Dan Sullivan, the Republican former state attorney general who's challenging Democratic Senator Mark Begich, moved to the state 17 years ago. Sullivan went to Washington in 2002 to work for the National Security Council and, later, the State Department. He kept his home in Alaska and returned to the state in 2009.

The senator does not own a home in Kansas. He registered to vote at the home of a person in his Senate district. Roberts said he paid rent to the owner of the home.


## Arkansas

## Alaska


Republican Representative Tom Cotton, who's in a neck-and-neck battle for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Mark Pryor, doesn't own property in the state. He does point out his sixth-generation state roots, noting that he lives in a home his father owns. He's running an ad, filmed in front of that house, where he pledges, "I'll stay connected to my roots."

Dan Sullivan, the Republican who's challenging Democratic Senator Mark Begich, moved to the state 17 years ago. Sullivan went to Washington in 2002 to work for the government. He kept his home in Alaska and returned there in 2009. Now Begich is attacking Sullivan for spending so much time away from Alaska.


It could matter in a close race. "It's a small matter, but something the Pryor people are positioned to take advantage of," said Arkansas Poll director Janine Parry.

Republican Representative Tom Cotton is running against Democratic Senator Mark Pryor. Cotton does not own property in the state. He points out that he is a sixth-generation Arkansan and lives in his father's home. Cotton filmed a commercial in front of that house, where he promises, "I'll stay connected to my roots."


Republicans tried to get her off the ballot, saying she didn't fulfill residency requirements, but a Louisiana judge dismissed the suit last week. Landrieu said she still lived in Louisiana. She, her siblings and their mother jointly own the family home in New Orleans where she grew up.

Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu listed her Washington address as her home when she registered her Senate candidacy.


While the issue may have singed Cochran, he fought back by citing the projects, or earmarks, he'd obtained for the state during his four decades in Congress. "That money could be used to build a bridge somewhere so people could cross the creek to get to church," said Marty Wiseman, a Starkville, Mississippi, political analyst.

## New Hampshire


Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, locked in a tight race with Brown, is reminding voters of his background in another state. "This is my home. This is where my kids grew up," she has said. "My goal has been to serve the people of New Hampshire, not to serve myself."

## Kansas


Brown might benefit from the influx of Massachusetts residents into the state. Among those who live near that state's border, he has a 22 percentage-point edge over Shaheen in the latest WMUR Granite State poll.

Back in Kansas, Roberts spent 97 days from July 2011 to August 2013 in Kansas.


Luke McGregor, a 48-year-old Delray Beach resident, also has to do his share of educating. On a flight home from New York last week, McGregor witnessed a woman who claimed to have an "emotional-support dog" that whined and scratched at its cage throughout the trip — behavior considered unacceptable in a legitimately trained service dog.

"Somebody will take Fluffy with them into a restaurant, and the dog will bark or snap at someone, or poop on the floor," said Kris Baker, 63, who lives in Orlando. That causes problems when people come in with a real service dog. "We get the questions and the resentment. It's harder for us."


One day a big bull head-butted a gate and knocked it into Owen, who is legally blind from a childhood eye infection. That gate cost her 60 stitches and almost her leg.

## PHARM Dog Is Unique


"If I had to sell my animals, I think I'd lose the ambition to live," Harig said.

For Allenbrand, the big problem was money. She did not have money to pay for dogs and training.


"But here's the thing about farmers — and I'm married to one — they're stubborn," Allenbrand said. "It's what they do. Most were born into it and they don't want to give it up."

Owen said she could work only because of Sweet Baby Jo.


The researchers also say those effects probably come from "Sesame Street's" focus on presenting viewers with an academic curriculum, heavy on reading and math, that would appear to have helped prepare children for school.

## TV Show Prepares Kids Like Preschool


Under the supervision of University of Texas psychology professors Ryan L. Boyd and James W. Pennebaker, machines churned through 54 plays — 33 by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobold — and tirelessly computed each play's average sentence-length, quantified the complexity and psychological valence of its language, and sussed out the frequent use of unusual words.

## Who Was Theobold?


The mechanism behind the reduction in shark attacks remains unclear. It's likely relevant that many species have declined by 50 percent to more than 90 percent over the past several decades worldwide, primarily due to overfishing. In California, the recovery of elephant seal colonies that sharks feast on may play a role. (The seals are thought to draw predators away from humans.)

Shark bites increased much less over the same period of time. Ferreti said that means the risk of an attack has actually declined by quite a bit.


The agency wrote only five citations for possession of protected shark species last year, one for a boat, the others on land, with three of those from a single enforcement stop, spokeswoman Amanda Nalley said.

Rama Shuster, a state wildlife officer, noted catch-and-release laws. He said it is not OK to keep animals when only catch-and-release fishing is allowed. People are never allowed to drag sharks up on the beach to take pictures.


Shiffman, the UM scientist, said he was astounded at the wildlife agency's apparent failure to investigate or charge anyone, given the fact there's video evidence all over the Internet.

Robert Hueter, from a shark science center, said many tired sharks die from catch-and-release fishing. Hammerheads can still die after long fights.


The money being spent by the government to evaluate this issue would be better spent trying to evaluate this question: Is the number of white sharks rising or falling?"

## A Fake Seal As Shark Bait


State and federal regulators, who are expected to make their decision on endangered species status this year, have conducted research and held hearings to analyze the accuracy of the census.

## Set That Shark Loose


Among the rebuttals to the census is one from Michael L. Domeier, a leading shark expert and president of the Marine Conservation Science Institute.

Chris Lowe is a scientist who has been researching white sharks since 2002. On a recent weekday, Lowe watched as fishermen at a Manhattan Beach Pier tried to catch halibut and other fish.


George H. Burgess, curator of the Florida Museum of Natural History's International Shark Attack File, is among nine scientists nearing completion on a separate census study that will show that there are more than 2,000 adult and sub-adult white sharks off Central California. That study is expected to be submitted for review by state and federal regulators.

Eric Martin, of the Roundhouse Aquarium at the end of the pier, remembered a day last July when a fisherman hooked a great white. Martin explained that it was illegal to land the fish, but the fisherman refused to let it go. Martin cut the line with a knife.


"It's really something you see more in Florida than in California, where we have more of a conservation ethic," he said. "People should be viewing these sharks as wonderful animals that are important to the ocean and admiring how beautiful they are."

## Too Much TV Terror, Too Little Science


Wegner said some of his colleagues had reached out to the fishermen who caught the shark, hoping to collect samples to learn more about the fish. The shark was probably a female based on its size, he said; male makos typically max out at 500 to 600 pounds.

The scientists said the mako population is stable and did not have scientific concerns about the catch.


"The law is unfair," said Gian, whose store in Los Angeles' Chinatown sells shark fins for $599 a pound. "Why single out Chinese people in California when shark fins are legal in many other states?"

Eighteen months ago, California Governor Jerry Brown outlawed the sale of shark fins in his state. Stores were only given permission to sell what they already had in stock. On Monday, even that became illegal. Those who break the new law could be jailed for up to six months. They could also be fined up to $1,000.


Shark fin soup dates to the Ming Dynasty, when it was reserved for emperors as a symbol of status and power over the most dangerous predators. "Back when it was quite a physical feat for a fisherman to land a shark, it was the ultimate symbol of yang, or male energy," said Ki, a spokeswoman for the Asian Pacific American Ocean Harmony Alliance.

Across town, retired science teacher Judy Ki explained why she thinks the ban is a good idea.


The state, and supporters of the ban, hope that will change.

## More Demand, More Hunting


Island native Lorraine Alesna, who has long fished at Makena Landing — a popular launching spot for kayakers and snorkelers — shook her head at the jet skiers, kite surfers and other tourists who zoomed into the waves without paying attention to pupping season for sharks (the winter months), or common-sense tips like avoiding turbid water that attracts them.

## Sharks Hunting Green Sea Turtles?


The sharks, known for their distinctive silvery skin with dark spots, have been swimming through breached earthen levees into former Cargill salt evaporation ponds, where they are gobbling up herring, crabs, worms and other species that have exploded in number as the ponds have been opened to bay waters.

Great white sharks eat people. Leopard sharks do not.




## Easy Eating For The Sharks




## Not Like "Jaws" At All


Thirteen bodies were recovered after Friday's avalanche. Three Sherpas were still missing in the ice and snow, and are presumed dead.

## Climbing Trips Canceled


Tusli Gurung, a guide who was at base camp Wednesday, estimated that nearly half the Sherpas had left.

Ed Marzec is an American climber at base camp. He said that Sherpas were loading their equipment onto a helicopter.


Dali, 28, lost her husband Pen Tenji, 27, in the avalanche. His body is yet to be recovered.

"Our father was the only one who earned in our family. We live in a rented apartment. Our grandparents need regular medication. And all of us are still in school. We have no idea how we are going to support the family," said 17-year-old Phinjum, Kaji's second daughter.


The sinking of the Concordia, attributed to the irresponsible behavior of its Italian captain Francesco Schettino, has been a national shame. The image of the half-sunken ship was also associated with the crisis-stricken state of the country.

All those working on the rescue "are a great (source) of Italian pride," Prime Minister Enrico Letta wrote on Twitter. He invited Gabrielli and others for a meeting in Rome.


Candace Witherspoon, a wardrobe stylist in Los Angeles, went to a store in Century City last April to buy a purse and shop for one of her celebrity clients. She was wearing a T-shirt and jeans. In a letter to the company, Witherspoon said the sales associate barely greeted her, then ignored her, in contrast with her treatment of white patrons.

Toni Duclottni runs a fashion website in Los Angeles. She went to a department store and wanted to spend about $4,000 on shoes. But she spent the money in another store when after she got ignored.


"We will conceivably see more years like this in the future," said geologist Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.

Scientists expect they will see less and less snow in California in the future.


Adapting to more winter runoff could literally require an act of Congress. Dams are operated according to a fairly rigid set of rules developed for each reservoir by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and written into federal law. They are designed to maintain the delicate balance between water supply and flood control — and Congress has to authorize any changes.

## "You Can't Wait"


"I see groundwater becoming incredibly important in the ability to store water from those years that are wet and warm," Mount said. "When you've got it, put it in the ground."

"Who wants to be the responsible person for not having that flood space in the reservoir?" asked Iris Stewart-Frey, who teaches environmental studies at Santa Clara University.


That was the day that Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the Treasury would reach the current $16.7 trillion debt limit, and could no longer borrow to meet its obligations.

The Treasury will be able borrow normally through Feb. 7 or perhaps a month longer. It would also pay for the government through Jan. 15. More than 2 million federal workers will be paid under the agreement.


"When the stakes are highest Mitch McConnell can always be counted on to sell out conservatives," said Matt Bevin, who is challenging the party leader from the right in a 2014 election primary.

Sen. Ted Cruz said the measure was "a terrible deal." He criticized fellow Republicans for lining up behind it.


The shutdown initially idled about 800,000 workers, but that soon fell to about 350,000 after Congress agreed to let furloughed Pentagon employees return to work. While there was widespread inconvenience, the mail was delivered, Medicare continued to pay doctors who treated seniors and there was no interruption in Social Security benefits.

## Tea Party Allies Come Up Empty


Most of the Treasury Department's law enforcement support functions tied to the Bank Secrecy Act will be halted, interrupting efforts to crack down on money laundering and other financial crimes.

## Planes Will Fly, Trains Will Run


But the Department of Transportation said that all air traffic control services will continue without interruption, which is good news for the flying public. Amtrak doesn't expect disruption of passenger railroad service, either.

Most of the Treasury Department's law enforcement will be halted. This may interrupt efforts to crack down on crimes involving money.


The Defense Department is also allowed to maintain emergency police, fire and medical services during a government closure. But about half of the Pentagon's 718,000 civilian employees will be barred from working. All travel and training of both military and civilian personnel will stop, as well, except for activities needed to support exempt military operations and emergency services.

A shutdown won't affect the military immediately. Soldiers will get paid. But they might face delays in receiving that pay if the shutdown lasts for long.


— All Social Security and Supplemental Security Income payments to beneficiaries will continue without interruption. Field offices will remain open. New and replacement Social Security cards and proof-of-income letters will not be issued, nor will replacement Medicare cards. The Social Security Administration plans to furlough just over 18,000 workers, but its core services will continue.

## What's Closed, What's Open


— The Internal Revenue Service will continue its automated tax collection process, but many tax-processing functions will grind to a halt, including tax refund payments. The IRS said only 8,826 out of 94,516 agency employees will be working under a contingency plan that keeps computers running so that electronic returns can continue to be received.

— All Social Security check to retired people will continue.


— The U.S. Postal Service doesn't rely on congressional appropriations for its budget, so post offices nationwide will be open for business as if any other day of business.

— The Internal Revenue Service will continue to collect taxes. But tax refunds won't be sent out.


A Yellowstone employee involved in reservations told McClatchy, on the condition of anonymity because he lacked authorization to speak, that call volume was high as people who began booking reservations back in May 2012 now face the prospects of ruined vacations. One call stood out, he said, because it was from a man whose wedding and honeymoon are planned for the park and are in jeopardy.

The National Mall, often called the nation's front lawn, will be closed to tourists. The National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of the American Indian and National Gallery of Art will be shuttered.


No one was amused, however. The United States, after all, is not a bit player on the international stage like Greece. It is the unquestioned global leader. And while after a decade of controversial war it's not so unusual for Europeans to express hostility toward the United States, many were shocked to see how hostile Americans seem to be to one another — and disinterested in how their internal fight might affect the rest of the world.

The writer nicely summed up how Europeans seemed to view the United States during the fight: broken, like Greece, and bossy, like Germany.


"This is a window of opportunity now, for two continents with shared goals, to make a partnership under which they will not diminish," he said. "Of course, they cannot wait 20 years to make this happen. This is a moment, and it must be seized. Instead, we have dysfunctional governments on both sides of the Atlantic."

The United States will long remain the world's most powerful nation, he noted. And Europe, troubled as it may be, remains a big force in business.


President Barack Obama said as much Thursday in remarks from the White House.

"Europeans really don't understand," Post said. "The United States is the model democracy; it should be leading by example. Instead, there is no talking, there is no compromise. The lesson to the rest of the world is that the United States these days can't be relied upon."


For years, Yosemite was an emblem of something different — the very notion of preserving American wilderness "for all people, for all time," said Mike Tollefson, its former superintendent.

## "The Timing Is Horrible"


Small rescue teams will still be available; this is a popular time of year for climbers to scale the park's famous "big walls," such as the monolith known as El Capitan. There will still be hikers in the backcountry for days to come; most were warned before leaving that a government shutdown was possible. And basic services — a market, a post office — will still be available to park employees who live there.

Anybody left had to leave the park by 3 p.m. Thursday. Hotels will serve breakfast to remaining guests that morning, then begin shutting down.


Determined to curtail development and industry, Congress approved a bill in 1864 that protected Yosemite. Technically, it was not the first national park — that honor goes to Yellowstone, created eight years later. But it was the first time the federal government had protected a piece of wilderness for the public's use and enjoyment.

The closure of Yosemite feels particularly significant and painful to some.


Jenkins directed his team to a pair of 7-foot-tall contraptions next to a chain-link fence — escape baskets that once sat near the top of the shuttle, ready to slide astronauts to safety should something go wrong before launch.

Earth to Sky Calculus began seven years ago, when Phillips started teaching calculus to his daughter and a few of her friends during their lunch break at school. The kids were in fifth grade at the time.

They've tried to measure changes in the ozone layer during a solar storm, and on the anniversary of the Voyager I spacecraft launch, they sent a rubber chicken into space with a "golden iPod" — their version of Voyager's iconic, but to their minds dated, golden record. (Sorry, Ann Druyan.)

The pair marched briskly up a 3.7-mile trail that rose 2,500 feet.

Across the United States, Sikhs and Muslims are banding together to defend their respective religions. Someone bent on harming Muslims wouldn't understand — or care about — the distinction between the two faiths, they say, and both deserve to live in peace.

That was less than a year after white supremacist Wade Michael Page killed six people and wounded four others at the Oak Creek temple. Kaleka said his father, Satwant Singh Kaleka, was the last person killed inside the temple, after Page broke into an office where the elder Kaleka was calling 911.

An adjacent building was also evacuated and 16 people had to leave, Cuellar said.

All guests had been accounted for, and no one was injured. Caldwell said they were moved to other buildings on the property.


Experts in Lake County recently told the Orlando Sentinel the region could expect more collapsing earth as companies that repair sinkholes are seeing an increase in complaints.

Officials investigated a possible sinkhole at another Florida home in June. The homeowner's pool cracked and shifted in the ground. The hole — 40 to 50 feet wide and 30 to 40 feet deep — stabilized.


Months later, enrolled in his first astrophysics course, he learned classmate Richard Vo had discovered an unusual stellar object — possibly the densest ever found.

Sandoval stumbled upon his unusual find after only a week of looking. He and his professor have named what he spotted a hypercompact cluster. They believe that it is the remains of one galaxy that has been swallowed up by another.


They are keeping the names and locations of both findings secret until they have been published.

Instead, he and Vo are rushing to release their findings together with Romanowsky.


"The government has been telling us for years that they're going to rebuild the hotel, and it never happens," said Sabz Ali, 18, trudging up the slope with his Japanese-made skis over his shoulder. His family owns a small hotel nearby called the Green View, which pulls in about $20 a month, on average, from a smattering of guests. "The (big) hotel is the main thing. If they build it, people will come."

When the Taliban tried to kill 15-year-old Malala Yousafzai in October, it brought world attention to Swat. People feared the Taliban might bring more violence back to the valley.


Pakistan is more than just a world of fundamentalist clerics and car bombers. The world's second-highest peak, K2, beckons mountaineers to the Pakistan-China border region. In southern Sindh province, the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro opens a window onto the ancient Indus Valley civilization, with ruins that have survived for 4,600 years.

## Still Waiting For Help


But the pinnacle of Pakistani tourism has been the 91-mile Swat Valley, about 140 miles northwest of the capital, Islamabad. Members of the Gandhara civilization dating to the third century B.C. left behind massive cliff-side carvings of Buddha and stone shrines that still stand. Some of the country's best trout fishing can be found in the meandering Swat River and its network of creeks and streams.

"The government has been telling us for years that they're going to rebuild the hotel, and it never happens," said Sabz Ali. The 18-year-old trudges up the slope with his skis over his shoulder. His family owns a small hotel nearby that makes about $20 a month. "The [big] hotel is the main thing. If they build it, people will come."


Khan contends that provincial and federal officials have made the revival of tourism in Swat a low priority. His requests to meet with top officials are largely ignored, he said, along with pleas for financial assistance.

"Swat is now totally cleared of the Taliban," said Syed Aqil Shah, tourism minister for Swat Valley. "What happened to Malala was just one incident that made people start talking again about Swat security.


Making matters worse, the region was hit by the epic floods that washed over a swath of Pakistan in 2010. More than 120 hotels in Swat were damaged or destroyed, and only 20 have been rebuilt, with the owners paying for the work themselves.

"But I assure you that Swat is as safe as any other place in Pakistan right now." Still, tourism is not what it used to be.


Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa officials say the provincial government has the will to revive tourism but has not received enough federal aid. As for Malam Jabba, Shah says the ski resort's restoration plans were held up by an administrative dispute over whether the hotel property is owned by the federal or provincial government. Government officials have now agreed, Shah said, that the provincial administration will oversee the hotel's reconstruction, which should begin this summer.

Reviving tourism in Swat is a low priority for the government, Khan said. Top officials ignore his pleas for meetings and funding.


"The jury will make up its own mind after it sees the video and hears the other testimony," Wilson said. No trial date has been set.

## Police Department Fired The Officer


Walter Scott's brother Rodney Scott said the family is "very happy and pleased" with the indictment of Slager.

Slager was fired from the police force immediately after the video became public.


Slager's lawyer did not want to comment on the indictment.

Walter Scott's brother Rodney Scott said the family is "very happy and pleased" with the charges against Slager.


Chris Stewart, a lawyer for Scott's family, said in a news conference after the indictment that they plan to file a wrongful death lawsuit against North Charleston and its police force.

Slager's lawyer did not want to comment about the charges.


Prosecutors cannot try anyone for a serious crime in the state without an indictment, unless the defendant waives the grand jury hearing. Defense attorneys said it is rare for a grand jury not to indict because just 12 of the 18 jurors have to agree it is probable the person charged committed the crime.
Only one of the officers went to trial, but the jury could not agree on a decision. A retrial is set for next week.


Simpson Miller did not raise the reparations issue in her remarks but spoke of slavery's enduring legacy. She noted that even after Britain passed a law on March 25, 1807, abolishing the slave trade, slavery continued.

Ban said he hopes the memorial will become a call to action against modern-day slavery.


The conference, Gonsalves said, "is the first step in the Caribbean's quest to address and redress a psychic, historical, socio-economic and development wound" that is 400 years deep and Caribbean-wide.

## European Leaders Say No To Reparations


And despite former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's assertion in 2007 that slavery was "a crime against humanity," Britain still hasn't apologized, activists say.

Instead, the city posted warning signs, stationed sentries at the hill and put hay bales around trees and pads around posts.

Omaha, Nebraska, banned sledding at a popular hill as a test. After people ignored the ban, the city was forced to allow sledding again. City lawyer Tom Mumgaard said the ban was just not going to work.


Overland Park will, too, said city spokesman Sean Reilly, although he said most of the city's best sledding hills are on private property.

Russell Pope said he hopes Overland Park will never ban sledding.


"Kids' safety is paramount to us parents," he said. "But there's always a risk. And I understand there's money involved, but you can't take all the joy out of being a kid. If you don't go sledding in the winter, all you've got is your iPad and SpongeBob. I'd rather they get out there and get some exercise."

## Protesters Of All Ages


The later start is urged for middle and high schools so kids can get the 8.5 to 9.5 hours of shut-eye they need to grow and learn, the academy said. But only about 15 percent of U.S. high schools have an opening bell that rings at 8:30 a.m. or later, according to federal data.

## "Not The Healthiest Way"


"So the 10-year-old who went to bed at 9 p.m. becomes the 13-year-old who can't get to sleep until 11," Owens said. This biological shift occurs at precisely the time that the brain and body are developing at a rapid clip, and school commitments become more intense, making it "the perfect storm," she said.

Owens said starting school later is a simple and effective way to make sure young people are getting enough sleep.


At Community High School District 230 based in Orland Park, 8 a.m. is the regular start time every day but Wednesday, when students get to school at the blissful hour of 9:30 a.m., to allow for staff professional development.

When she arrived at Disney's office, the theme park pioneer made her an offer: Design costumes for a new ride he was planning for the 1964 New York World's Fair. That ride would be, he promised her, an attraction that would bring joy "to every child from 1 to 100."

At Disneyland in California, Disney World in Florida, and Disney parks in Japan, France and Hong Kong, you'll find a simple, old-fashioned boat ride: It's a Small World.


Small World's technology is outdated, and some say it perpetuates broad stereotypes, with Arab dolls flying on magic carpets and Mexicans wearing sombreros. And the famous theme song is so annoying that a recent online poll ranked it the world's worst ear worm, beating "Gangnam Style" and "Who Let the Dogs Out?"

## Song's Message Of Hope


Even state-of-the-art technology doesn't guarantee success.

## "Innocent And Pure"


"Ultimately, technology is going to fade," theme park consultant Phil Hettema said. "What sticks with people is a story."

Rolly Crump helped design Small World in 1964. He said a simple theme and detailed artwork have kept the ride popular.


Production has yet to begin, but Turteltaub said he expects to rely on computer-generated imagery to create a "world of laughter, a world of tears."

On Small World, riders see the world through the eyes of children, said Disney designer Kim Irvine.


Disney imagined a flume journey with more than 200 animatronic dolls, dressed in traditional garb from around the world. The theme song, written by Richard and Robert Sherman, plays an average of 1,200 times in a 16-hour day. The Sherman brothers originally wrote the song as a slow ballad, intended as a message of hope following the Cuban Missile Crisis. But Disney ordered them to speed it up.

Twenty-five years ago, Juanita and Mark Harrigan brought their daughter on Small World. Today, they are bringing their young granddaughter.


"The technology today is burning people out," he said. "This ride is so simple, so clean and nostalgic."

"He likes the singing and the animals," she said.


The overhaul angered some purists but did little to diminish its popularity.

He called the ride "innocent and sweet." It provides a rest from "the noise of our society," he said.

## Accent On Fast


Ronald Goldfarb, a former federal prosecutor, curated "After Snowden," an anthology of essays on security versus privacy in the Information Age that examines the fallout from the NSA leaks for the news media, the courts, the intelligence community and the whistleblowers.

Sergei Markov works for the Russian government. He said Snowden needed Russia's protection.


"We didn't begin this book as a defense of Snowden. Everyone has his own views, that he's either too much an angel or too much a devil. But he has raised profoundly important issues," said Goldfarb, who advocates a more moderate prosecution of Snowden in light of the surveillance reforms that have resulted from his disclosures.

"We can't send him back just because America demands it," Markov said.


"It would be wise on both parties' parts for him to plead guilty to the technical crime he's committed. There is no question he took property he shouldn't have taken," said Goldfarb, whose work for the Justice Department goes back to the Kennedy administration.

Ben Wizner is one of Snowden's lawyers. He said that Snowden is not likely to leave Moscow soon.


Don't get me wrong: that's bad enough. Most people don't want to share the intimate details of their personal lives with government snoops. But the Obama administration has managed to convince some of the more naive among us that the NSA's big data sweeps just sit in some huge storage facility that are sifted with algorithms to identify or investigate targets that may have something to do with terrorism.

But our government's actions obviously had nothing to do with terrorism.

No wonder the Aussies were angry. For years they had cooperated covertly with Indonesian intelligence services. Overt cooperation was out of the question, due to Jakarta and Canberra's longstanding war of words over "Bali, boats, and beef" — the treatment of Aussie tourists, South Asian "boat" people, and cattle exports.




Democracies operate under the concept of "ordered liberty." They establish rules to protect both the individual and the community as whole — guarding both individual freedom and public safety. No one has the right to discard those rules and substitute rules of his own devising. Flouting ordered liberty doesn't advance freedom. It creates chaos. And chaos enables evil and kills democracies.

Lawrence Bardon, 67, purchased a fire hose when he bought his home. When he smelled smoke Wednesday, he hooked the hose to a nearby fire hydrant.

He raced home to San Marcos where he felt it would be safe. Instead a fire erupted there and covered his neighborhood in smoke. Without waiting for an evacuation order, Bye left.


Meanwhile, the Tomahawk fire, in the northeast section of Camp Pendleton, burned more than 6,000 acres, forcing evacuations of two housing areas on base and two schools, one on base and one in nearby Fallbrook.

## "A Scene From Armageddon"


A blaze dubbed the Twin Oaks fire prompted the evacuation of Cal State San Marcos and nearby homes as a fixed-wing aircraft dropped water.

And in the canyons next to Rancho Santa Fe and Fairbanks Ranch, firefighters continued to battle the Bernardo fire. This erupted on Tuesday. By early Wednesday, it had burned 1,500 acres.


In 2007, the Witch fire burned 197,000 acres and destroyed 1,202 homes, killing two people and injuring 40. The Rice fire, burning at the same time, burned 9,472 acres and 206 homes, leaving five people injured.

Legoland did not burn, but the rides were shut down and the park was evacuated.


Curtains will descend from the roof automatically to close off the upper sections, creating the sort of intimate atmosphere that works better for less-attended MLS games.

The league welcomed its newest team with a street festival. Hundreds of fans came to celebrate. Arthur Blank and Don Garber arrived by helicopter to talk to newspapers and television. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed also attended.


The league has added five teams in the past five years, including the hugely successful Seattle Sounders. Garber said there is no worry about growing too fast given the abundance of soccer talent around the world.

"There will never be an MLS game in Atlanta where NFL lines are shown on the field," Blank said.


His first priority is to hire a team president for the MLS venture. He will also be exploring possible locations for a state-of-the-art training facility.

## Not A Side Show


"We don't want any stepchildren in our family," Blank said. "We want to make sure the people running soccer get up in the morning thinking about soccer and go to bed thinking about soccer."

"I don't know exactly what that means," Erika says. "But it's something big, and we're not going to rest until she gets there."

Erika cheers on her daughter, in Spanish. She says, "You can do it, Luisa!"


At 34, she's the kind of woman who hardly pays attention to herself: frizzy hair tossed back in a bun, old sweatpants and dark circles under her eyes.

Every day, Erika says, don't take no for an answer.


Occasionally friends help her pick up a day of work counting tortillas on an assembly line — so long as it doesn't clash with the children's schedules.

"On the field, they're all the same," Zein said. "It doesn't matter how much you make or where you live or who you are."


There were some players below the thresholds who experienced FA and memory problems, suggesting that some individuals may be more sensitive to heading the ball.

Lipton and his team did not find a connection between heading and players' attention spans. They did not find a connection with the ability to do things that involved difficult thinking, either.


Lipton suggests that soccer start keeping a "head count" to monitor the number of headers players use in a given game. The head count would be analogous to the "pitch count" in baseball that ensures pitchers don't throw too many pitches in a single outing.

Simply heading a ball did not lead to more injury.  Players could safely head the ball 885 to 1,550 times a year without having white matter problems. It took almost 1,800 headers for players to have trouble with their memory.


Bolor Erdenebat, a 17-year-old junior who arrived from Mongolia in early 2013, said that back home, she didn't know the meaning of "human rights."

Omar Benitez is one student who has benefited from the program. The 18-year old from Colombia made his first school friend — from Liberia — on the soccer team.


Reyes' eyes lighted up. Her school had no athletic budget and a demographic comparable to the camp's. She pressed Gucciardi to stick around as a volunteer and help with physical education and after-school soccer. By 2008, Soccer Without Borders came together with a boys team. The girls followed.

Bolor Erdenebat is 17 and from Mongolia. She went to a school board meeting to argue for a soccer field. She was impressed by the school board members, who listened to all points of view.


Upsets galore: After the dust settled in Week One, reigning champion Spain and perennial power England had already been eliminated. That left the door open for such countries as Colombia, Costa Rica, Algeria and Chile to show their stuff.

Shaky goaltenders: Few keepers demonstrated they could single-handedly steal a game for their side. Any shot became a good shot in Brazil. That's quite different from hockey's Stanley Cup playoffs, for example, where you sometimes wonder if anybody is going to score.


"USA, USA:" Despite being placed in the same division with such heavyweights as Germany, Ghana and Portugal, the Americans made it out of the so-called "Group of Death" and took Belgium to overtime before being eliminated.

Until now, that's where the infatuation has ended. Once kids stopped playing the game, they fell into the more traditional viewing habits of college football on Saturdays, the National Football League on Sundays, with a baseball and college basketball game when there was more at stake.

## Keep On Playing

Until now, that's where it ended. Once kids stopped playing the game, they watched football, baseball and basketball like everyone else.


Or in which "injured" players are regularly carried off on stretchers — when's the last time you saw that in any American sport? — only to return to the game seconds later.

### CON: Soccer's a "fine game," but not for me


But I am not here to mock. I've tried to like soccer. It seemed like the open-minded thing to do.

WASHINGTON - Soccer is easy to make fun of.  In what other sport can we put together a scorecard of the number of fake "injuries" or the time the supposedly injured players spent squirming on the ground?

## It's All Good Fun


"The rules are there," Blake said. "The game can be physical, but the officials have to make those calls to keep it from getting overly rough."

Comstock says the best way to decrease head injuries is to try to stop the amount of rough play between athletes.


If referees are going to make errors, he added, they should "err on the side of safety for these kids."

"We don't have to allow soccer to turn into football," she said.


Parents can help by making sure their children are playing for a coach who doesn't encourage overly aggressive behavior and in a league that hires referees who appropriately call fouls and give penalties when players are too rough, Comstock said.

Roger Blake leads the group that governs high school sports in the state of California. He agrees that safety must come first too.


Russia's last gold came Sunday in four-man bobsled. The games' signature moment for home fans was Adelina Sotnikova, cool as ice at 17, becoming Russia's first gold medalist in women's Olympic figure skating.

Russia's golden run started with its victory in team figure skating.


So what about the remaining 30 percent?

Sochi organizers said that seven of every 10 tickets available have been sold.


CoSport, the official ticket reseller in the United States and six other countries, said the Sochi Games generated "good demand" for tickets and packages.

"I expect it to be orange," said Jeroen de Roever, the head of official Duch ticket seller ATPI. "We have been sold out for quite a while."

Uhls, who is the lead author of the study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, wanted to see what would happen if a group of children had to spend an extended period of time communicating completely device-free.

## Looking At People Making Faces


To Neil Bernstein, a psychologist in Washington, D.C., who specializes in child and adolescent behavior disorders, the researchers' findings seem consistent with what he's seen on the ground in working with children for more than 30 years. And while he says he agrees with the importance of teaching self-control and social skills, he would add empathy to the list, too.

Due to these findings, these "soft" skills "should be a larger part of our education system, says Kenneth Dodge. He is a professor at Duke. Dodge was a main investigator in this study as well as in the original Fast Track project. Parents should do all they can to encourage these skills with their children, Dodge says.


Several parts of the Fast Track study have been picked up successfully in other school settings, Sorensen says, such as a social-emotional learning curriculum called Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies, or PATHS. Programs like Fast Track need buy-in from school systems, teachers and parents, she says, and that can be a tough sell. But she adds that it's a strength of Fast Track that the students get support both at school and at home.

Lane W. Martin, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, agreed that the approach had potential.

## "Excitement And Satisfaction"


Sharks are critical to the overall balance of ocean ecosystems, but commercial fishermen catch them by the millions for their fins, cartilage and meat.

## Like A Smartphone


Because most sharks don't linger near the surface — in direct sunlight — the solar-powered tags are programmed to collect data for about six months while running on conventional batteries. Then the tags detach and float to the surface, said Mahmood Shivji, director of the Guy Harvey Research Institute, part of Nova Southeastern University.

Antonio Fins runs the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation. "We've learned a lot from tagging sharks, not least of which is that they are highly migratory," he said. "They are not American sharks or Bahamian sharks or Mexican sharks. They don't know borders or nationalities."


"If you have a solar panel, in theory, that tag should be able to transmit 100 percent of its data," he said.

## Floating Up To The Light


At 22, Mohamed is a newly minted cop on the beat, a community liaison officer making a courtesy call to a local merchant — a time-tested neighborhood policing method. But her visit, and each one she makes in this immigrant bastion, breaks new ground.

## "Love Takes Time"


Some officers complain she is breaking a long-standing uniform code.

Strangers told her to "take the towel off your head," and "go back to your terror state."


"And here comes Kadra Mohamed, who has defied logic for whites and Somalis alike," said local activist Omar Jamal. "She's a mystery to both cultures."

St. Paul's Assistant Chief Todd Axtell said that uniform rules, and all rules, must be changed when necessary.


Spokesman Josh Earnest would say only that the White House considers the breach of one of Hollywood's largest studios to be a "serious national security matter."

"How do you sanction the world's most heavily sanctioned country?" asked Asia expert John Park.


One possibility would be to unleash the United States' own hackers in the military's Cyber Command to disable the computers that launched the attack and stop them from doing more damage. But to do that runs the risk of damaging computer systems in China, where, experts say, North Korea bases some of its cyber capabilities.

## A Useful Tool For North Korea


In June, the nation called the plot of "The Interview" an "act of war." After the attack on Sony began, though, North Korea said it had no part. Still, it lauded the hacking as a "righteous deed of supporters and sympathizers."

His advice for Americans, the president said, "would be that people go to the movies."

Then last week, violent attacks on immigrant shopkeepers in Durban townships exploded and have continued since. Dozens of immigrants in Johannesburg and other cities shuttered their shops Wednesday as anonymous cellphone text messages warned that Zulu people were coming to kill immigrants in neighborhoods with large migrant populations.

Last month, Zulu king Goodwill Zwelithini told his followers that foreigners should pack up and leave. Zwelithini is the leader of a large group in South Africa called the Zulus. President Jacob Zuma's eldest son, Edward, joined in. He said that foreigners were "taking over the country" in a "ticking time bomb."


Mobs looted shops Wednesday in the KwaZulu-Natal city of Pietermaritzburg, and the African Diaspora Forum reported a threat to firebomb a building in the town of Mthatha, in the Eastern Cape, that houses many foreign-owned shops.

## Durban Sees Worst Attacks


President Zuma last week condemned attacks on foreign nationals, adding that his government was taking steps against illegal immigrants, including curbing illegal migration, arresting foreigners involved in crime, and shutting down unlicensed shops.

"We have heard it's going to continue," Fana said. "We're trying to highlight it and bring it to the attention of the authorities, to create awareness and protect their lives and protect their businesses."


"Citizens should also provide information to the police if they know of foreign nationals who are engaged in criminal activities. They should not be attacked," Zuma said.

## Actions Against Illegal Immigrants


It turned out there were 10 owls in Bagu's dark, warm attic. Owl catcher Hussein Mduduzi, jumping from roof strut to roof strut, managed to catch two owlets, but the eight grown owls flew off.

Bagu's husband called EcoSolutions. It is a company that moves owls.


Owl catcher Mduduzi, who grew up in a village in KwaZulu-Natal province, remembers huddling in bed in a circular hut at night, hearing the hoots of owls. It meant there was something evil and dangerous lurking outside. He nestled down in fear.

"I started developing a love for owls," Ramathopa said.


"People would think that maybe someone sent that owl as a curse or maybe as a sign that someone would die," he said.

## Fear Changed To Love


Founded in 2012, The Rhino Orphanage says it has successfully raised and released nine rhinos back into the wild. Because of security concerns, the staff do not say how many rhinos are at the facility, which has no identifying signs at the entrance.

The poachers kill the rhinos because some people in Asia want their horns. These people believe the horns can be ground up and used as medicine. There is no scientific proof that the horns work as medicine.


"A lot of Republicans here are concerned about electability," Moore said. "It's not enough to cast a protest vote, and it's not enough to show you're angry at Washington. They want to elect a president."

Ken Wezl was waiting in the restaurant to hear from Bush. He thinks Bush would be "a good president."


His wife, Karen, wants to vote for Jeb Bush. "There's something about him, though; I'm not sold on him yet," said Karen Wezl, 68. "Sometimes I don't think he wants it."

In Spartanburg, Ron Pockette was at the Beacon Drive-In. He was checking out Ohio Governor John Kasich, another Republican candidate. He likes that Kasich says what he thinks. Kasich used to be a congressman and tried to make sure the government did not spend too much, Pockette said.


"He has lots of experience in Washington and in running a state, and he sounds strong, like he'll push his ideas forward," said Pockette, 58, a retired nurse and Navy veteran. "He has a proven track record."

Pockette said he will not vote for Donald Trump. He said Trump is entertaining, but he will not be a good president.


He won't vote for Trump, though he said the mouthy businessman keeps him entertained. "I like to hear him go off, but the guy can't carry the load," Pockette said.

## Trump Leads In The State


The agency responsible for the marine environment is the State Oceanic Administration. The traveling journalists, who are being supported on their tour by the East-West Center, dropped in to meet with Zhang Haiwen, director general of the Department of International Cooperation.

Ouyang Yujing works for a Chinese government agency. He said China is not breaking the law by building the islands.


Building artificial islands, she said, "is an international norm." It creates a benefit for the region and the country. China has been in strict compliance with both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its own tough regulations, she said.

## Many Sources Of Danger For Reefs


When asked to describe the damage to the coral that her agency monitors had presumably witnessed while the Chinese military was building the artificial islands, Zhang stood up in exasperation.

According to Haiwen, building artificial islands is normal in the international community. There are laws regarding island development. She claims China has been is compliance with both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its own tough regulations.


With the FAA sidelined in part by the congressional restriction, the task of crafting regulations for space travel increasingly could fall to NASA — which is not a good thing, said Gold, who leads an FAA advisory panel.

NASA is not an agency that makes rules, he said. And it "has no desire to become one." On the other hand, the FAA does make rules and would be best to do so for space flight.


Lead author Don Gurnett, an Iowa State plasma physicist and a Voyager project scientist, said the data showed conclusively that Voyager 1 had exited the heliopause — the bubble of hot, energetic particles that surrounds our sun and planets — and entered into a region of cold, dark space called the interstellar medium.

NASA officials said Thursday that the delayed confirmation was based on new evidence involving what is called "space plasma density." This is a measure of the amount of electrons in gas that comes from our sun and other stars.


"Even though it took 36 years, it's just an amazing thing to me," said study coauthor Bill Kurth, a radio and plasma researcher at the University of Iowa.

Lead author Don Gurnett said information from the spacecraft showed that Voyager 1 had exited the heliopause. This is the bubble of hot pieces of matter that surrounds our sun and planet. It entered into a region of cold, dark space called the interstellar medium. Gurnett is an Iowa State scientist who works on the Voyager project.


Voyager does, however, have two plasma wave antennas that stretch from its base in a wide V shape. The antennas, which are connected to a radio transmitter, detect the oscillation, or vibration, of excited plasma particles. The device will convert the oscillations into an audible noise that is recorded on Voyager's vintage eight-track tape recorder.

"The instrument failed in 1980, so the spacecraft is sort of instrument-challenged," Gurnett said.


Gurnett and his colleagues arrived at the crossing date of Aug. 25 by extrapolation.

Fortunately for Voyager scientists, the antennas picked up two long-lasting vibrations. The first was in October and November of 2012 and the second was in April and May of 2013. Both cases suggested that the plasma was cold and dense. Voyager was in interstellar space.


He said that any time a person dies, it sends the message of how dangerous these ventures are. Virgin will now have a harder time attracting customers, he said. Virgin's space plane had looked safer than a rocket to the public, he said.

"It's rocket science. It's dangerous, it's risky, it's complicated. Most of us who bought tickets know that," he said.


All indications are that he will do just that. But there have also been clouds for the monarch, who has reigned since 1975. More than other European monarchs, he had to fight for every scrap of popularity he attained.

But that protective aura has since ebbed, a trend that became noticeable when criticism emerged about a 2012 luxury hunting expedition to Botswana, conducted in the midst of an economic crisis that eventually left nearly a quarter of the Spanish workforce jobless.

"They kicked us out and now they're making us go through hoops?" said Victor Amira, a member of the "Ladineros" — a group that meets weekly at The Summit at First Hill, a Jewish retirement community, to study letters and texts in the onetime language of the Sephardim.

## A Large And Busy Community


But lately, thanks in big part to the Internet, the nation's 38 million Spanish speakers have been finding a lot more to read. The explosion of portable reading devices such as Amazon's Kindle and Barnes &amp; Noble's Nook has for the first time allowed publishers of Spanish-language content to market electronic books to U.S. buyers — often at a fraction of the cost of printed versions.

It was frustrating. Even in heavily Latino cities such as Los Angeles, readers of "libros en espanol," or "books in Spanish," could find few.


Michael Kelley, a student at Wichita East High School, attracted national attention after his mother said he was told last year that he should not wear a jacket bearing a varsity letter she had purchased. District officials have maintained that no one asked the student to remove his jacket.

## Who Is A Varsity Athlete?


A crowd favorite and the youngest speller, Hussain A. Godhrawala, 8, of Barnwell, South Carolina, seemed overwhelmed with joy when he got his word relating to nails or claws: unguiculate. Nine-year-old Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, got a rousing reaction to his winning word phaeton, an open automobile.

This year's Spelling Bee was especially dramatic. The first round on Wednesday went through 41 spellers without a mistake. But 24 spellers got sent home after stumbling on such words as Keeshond, a Dutch dog breed, and paradigm, which refers to patterns.


Semifinalists will take a further written test Wednesday evening.

A crowd favorite was Hussain A. Godhrawala. The youngest speller, Hussain is 8 years old and from Barnwell, South Carolina. He seemed almost overwhelmed when he got unguiculate. It means relating to nails or claws. Nine-year-old Kasey Cuenca Torres of San Angelo, Texas, got a rousing response to his winning word, phaeton. A phaeton is a kind of car without a roof.


The first stage round of the Scripps National Spelling Bee eliminated 24 of the 281 who began the day, with contest-ending stumbles on words such as Keeshond, a Dutch dog breed, and paradigm, referring to patterns.

In the second on-stage round, spellers were knocked out by some especially tough words. They included jeroboam (a wine bottle) and obtundent (lessening pain). Palatalize (use of the tongue in producing sounds) and diphtheria (a childhood illness) sent other spellers home.


MRI scans that measured the density and integrity of the brain's white matter — the bundles of fatty tissue that speed electrical signals among neurons — showed that after a single season, football and hockey players experienced changes that were greater than anything seen in the brains of the athletes who played noncontact sports. In addition, players who had the biggest changes in white matter had the worst performance on postseason tests of verbal learning and memory.

The researchers looked only at athletes who didn't have brain injuries during the season. They made important links between blows to the head and changes in the brain. They also found changes in the brain's abilities. The changes were there weeks after the season ended.


As live sports programming has become more expensive for networks to acquire, multimillion-dollar salaries for professional athletes and college coaches have increased as well. And some of the costs have trickled down to individual subscribers — sports fans or not.

All are angling for cable dollars, whether you want sports channels or not.


Time Warner subscribers in Southern California likely will see their bills increase because of the cable company's impending $7 billion deal for rights to broadcast Los Angeles Dodgers games. The Dodgers had an opening-day payroll of $216 million, the second-highest in baseball.

Cable companies do not want this. They like to sell popular channels like ESPN together with less desirable ones.


The answer, by all accounts, is money. "Spider-Man" and "Star Wars" stamps vastly outsell those commemorating the Civil War, insects and spiders, and Pacific Coast lighthouses.

"Harry Potter is a perfect example," Martin said. He's not pleased to see a stamp honoring the fictional boy wizard or his British creator, J.K. Rowling.


In an interview, Bailar said the stamp program "deserves more than comic strip characters and pop music characters."

Toni DeLancey is a postal service spokeswoman. She said the postal service needs "to change and improve." It needs, she said, to "serve the changing needs of the American public." When it comes to younger Americans, she added, the new stamps are probably the kind "they want to see."


The committee chair, Janet Klug, said she was disappointed by Bailar's resignation and does not think he represents others in the group.

DeLancey defended the 12-member committee that helps pick future stamps. The group, she said, is just keeping up with the times.


"I don't even know if the post office is making more money," she said. "I'm sure they would like to make more money. Who wouldn't? But it's also trying to engage a broader public and get them interested in stamps."

The member who quit, Benjamin Bailar, served as head of the Postal Service during the 1970s. He suggested that the committee be discontinued. The only purpose of the new stamps, he said, was to make more money.


"How likely is this disease to maintain itself and keep populations suppressed?" Raimondi asked. "How likely is it to jump to other species? Those are really important questions. And the jury is still out."
Starfish dying off is a natural event that may or may not be caused by humans, Murray said. It will continue on its own path, and hopefully starfish will survive, he said.


Heck's bill, called the Marine Disease Emergency Act, would require federal agencies to create a rapid response plan and free up research money for scientists, though it's uncertain what it might end up costing.

"The truth of the matter is we have absolutely no system in place to respond. None," Heck said.


Democratic Representative Derek Kilmer of Gig Harbor, Washington, who teamed up with Heck in 2013 to create the Puget Sound Recovery Caucus, said he wanted to back the effort because starfish were "turning into goo" and their survival was necessary for the health of the region's waters.

"It feels pretty good to be able to provide them something to eat," Perez said. "Kids have more energy, they're more excited to come. We have more kids."

"Sometimes I'll have 20 kids show up to help," Deichler said. "They're eating chili dogs at 8 in the morning — they're starving."


Now, in the fifth year, The Star hopes to push that total past $1 million.

"That was dinner," Deichler said. Their parents were "fighting in any way they could to put anything on the table for the kids."


Paul Southern, head of licensing for Disney's Lucasfilm, said part of the problem was high demand for hundreds of products featuring Rey meant some shoppers couldn't find her on store shelves. Target spokesman Lee Henderson said Rey toys and apparel are selling "exceptionally well" and most stores are selling as fast as they can stock shelves.

Monopoly is made by Hasbro. Early in January, an 8-year-old girl wrote to Hasbro. She wrote that "girls matter." Last week, both Disney and Hasbro decided to add a Rey piece to Monopoly games that will come out later this year.

Still, Ava's parents remain dedicated to helping with Mayo's research. "We wanted to participate, not only because we thought that at some point Ava might benefit, but we also wanted to help all the other babies … and to try to give them the best shot," DeShaw said.

Ava cannot take part in the stem cell study, since she already had her second operation. The stem cells are put into the heart during that second operation.


Clinics in various countries in Europe, Australia and Asia offer far more aggressive therapies. Patients can have stem cells taken out then grown in a laboratory for weeks, producing millions more cells.

"Everybody wants answers right now and you can't have them right now," Bradley said.


Although damage to crops — inflicted when stink bugs pierce fruit with their mouths and suck sugar out — has decreased since 2010 and 2011, there's no reason to believe the insect is in any permanent state of decline, said Gerry Brust, a state integrated pest management vegetable specialist for University of Maryland Extension.

## Can Escape The Cold


Stink bugs can escape cold conditions by living in dead or rotting trees, rock outcroppings or buildings, said Donald Weber, a research entomologist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

"That's what insect populations do. It goes up, down," he said.


According to a team of researchers funded by the USDA's Specialty Crop Research Initiative, Maryland and every state it shares a border with, plus New Jersey, are the only ones in which "severe agricultural and nuisance problems" related to stink bugs have been reported.

"They're perfectly capable of surviving the winter," Weber said.


Identifying and deploying natural enemies could take a long time. Introducing a stink bug predator could take three to five years and would require the approval of scientists from all three North American countries, Weber said.

Brandon Clarke, an administrator at the private Berkeley Carroll School in Brooklyn, New York, is enthusiastic about the project. He said StoryCorps, which is headquartered near the school, interviewed some of his teachers while developing an instructional guide for the Thanksgiving project.

Dave Isay is the founder of StoryCorps. He says "The Great Thanksgiving Listen" is an assignment that will last for many years.


A couple weeks before the holiday, Berkeley Carroll students may get some classroom exercises aimed at sharpening their interview skills, Clarke said.

Teens will be giving their "great-great-great-great-great-grandkids" a gift, Isay says. Listeners will have a chance to understand more about who their ancestors were.


Thus began a nine-week rehabilitation project with the ambitious goal of taking a stray of unknown provenance and giving her a future with purpose. It would be an uncertain undertaking with no promise of success.

Skaziak started the Throw Away Dogs Project. It is a group that rescues shelter dogs and gives them to the police. Jason Walters is a police officer who works with K-9 dogs. He helped Skaziak start the group. 


"There is no better feeling than saving a dog's life and giving them a job, [and] helping out our family in blue," Skaziak said.

Trainer Steve Primavera took Rousey to an empty field. He wore a padded bite sleeve. He swatted the sleeve with a stick.


Skaziak met Walters while working at a boarding facility near Philadelphia International Airport, and SEPTA was a client. During her time at the facility, she came up with the name "Throw Away Dogs" because people would drop off their pets and never return.

Rousey was not scared at all, Spaid said.


Inside a cavernous training building, Hope fetched a rubber toy and tennis balls. She had some trouble sniffing out hidden objects, but she didn't give up. And that meant she had a strong hunt drive.

It was time for Skaziak and Walters to say goodbye to Rousey.


Walters moved outdoors and had Hope fetch on cut grass and in tall weeds. Hope nailed it each time.

Skaziak would miss Rousey. She started to cry.

"We need fewer, better and fairer assessments," Susie Morrison, chief education officer and deputy superintendent at the Illinois State Board of Education, said at a recent meeting of state school officials in Washington.

Morrison is not against testing. She said that parents deserve to know how their children are doing in school. A large number of students graduate from high school but need special classes in reading and math before they go to college. Testing makes it clear what students know and do not know, she said. Then they can get extra help earlier in school.


"There's always been a group of parents that don't like testing," said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education research center. "I think the reason it's been brought to a rapid boil lately is because of these teacher evaluations."

Testing is not a good way to measure a child, said Jensen, a former teacher who has two children in high school.


Tests that states require to measure progress in math and reading cover about 20 percent of teachers, Petrilli said. Many states have standardized tests in other subjects so that all teachers can be evaluated by the results.

"None of this has anything to do with better education," she said.

New Hampshire and Missouri lawmakers said schools can't require students to use ID cards equipped with radio frequency identification (RFID) technology that can track them. The new laws are similar to one Oregon passed last year and what Rhode Island lawmakers passed in 2009.

This year, Florida became the first state to stop biometric technology in schools. Biometrics recognizes a person by scanning a fingerprint, eye or palm. Other states have passed similar laws. Kansas said that a student or parent must give permission for that information to be collected. New Hampshire, Colorado and North Carolina said schools cannot store the information in student records.


Hunger said RFID readers pick up a number of a student's badge that can be correlated to a student's identification in a school's central computer. If a badge is lost, she said, "no one else can read it; they'd only get a number if they did."

Florida State Senator Dorothy Hukill proposed the law that prevented the use of biometric technology in Florida schools.


Hunger said the industry recommends RFID technology as part of a "holistic approach" to school security, along with video cameras and trained personnel, especially after such incidents as the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in December 2012 in Connecticut, in which 20 students and six adults were killed.

She said students should not need it to buy a hot dog or check out a library book.


CAMDEN, N.J. — Ice and mud surrounded the water tower in a rough neighborhood in this roughest of cities. Graffiti on the tower and on boarded-up windows of nearby houses spoke of despair: "Stop the Violence." "Stop Hating." "Keep Camden Clean."

CAMDEN, N.J. — Inside a water tower in a rough part of this rough city, girls and a few boys peeled off coats and scarves. The kids gathered in giddy groups, chatted, laughed and practiced dance moves and cartwheels. A man pulled drums from a storage space.


As darkness fell, police cars cruised the grim streets, their headlights illuminating barren residential blocks and commercial stretches pockmarked by vacant storefronts.

At the center of it all was a cheerful woman. She wore orange jeans and a baseball cap.

Opponents warn of a slippery slope that starts with sugar but doesn't end there. Any number of other ingredients could be targeted next as a de facto warning to consumers, they say.

## Who Says Sugar Is Sugar?


"I was shocked," Sharp said. "I mean, it's turkey. Why is there sugar in it?"

"That one line on a label seems like a small thing," said Deborah Bailin of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "But not having it covers up a very big fact that the food industry does not want people to know."


"When you pick up a bottle of salad dressing, you can already see there are 47 different kinds of sugar in it," said Baylen Linnekin, executive director of the Washington-based Keep Food Legal Foundation. "By forcing what amounts to an added-sugar warning on the label, the government is attempting to skew consumer demand."

"I was shocked," Sharp said. "I mean, it's turkey. Why is there sugar in it?"

In March, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the GOP vice-presidential nominee in 2012, gave a speech in which he said the federal government was providing "a full stomach and an empty soul" to children who were getting free lunches.

"Less kids are buying school lunches," said lawmaker Robert Aderholt of Alabama. He said it was time "to hit the pause button" on new guidelines.


In Washington state, only 9.8 percent of eligible students go to the congregate settings, Murray said. The state ranks 38th in participation.

"My water bill is $80 a month, my gas bill is $200 a month, my electricity bill is $45 a month," Edwards said.


Noboru Yoshimura, administrative chief of the federation, said he was worried about sumo's declining popularity. Even though martial arts became part of the junior high school curriculum in 2012, kids are choosing kendo and judo over other options.

"Sumo is not a familiar sport compared to others like soccer and baseball," said Kento Nakazawa. He is with the Japan Sumo Association.


"Some high school clubs make you eat until you throw up, but some clubs just leave it to you to bulk up," said Akiteru Kiyomiya as he watched his sons, 13-year-old Itto and 10-year-old Kenshi, train. "If this is the path they want to take, then yes, I'll support them."

Coach Shinju Taira said he was worried that sumo isn't as important as a sport now or as part of Japanese culture. Not every sumo student will become a professional wrestler, he said. However, sumo is important because it helps children learn to become leaders.


But the boys' mother, Yumi Kiyomiya, was not so sure. "I actually don't want them to get big," she said. "I just feed them balanced meals."

Hisao Yoshiyoka has two sons learning sumo. She said they were learning how to live in Japanese society and about Japanese traditions.


States such as Florida, Arizona and Nevada — "the poster children of the boom and bust" — still aren't pulling in as many people as during their boom years, Frey added. His analysis found that the number of people moving to those "high flyers" from other states actually fell between 2012 and 2013.

"People were sort of frozen in place by the recession," said Kenneth M. Johnson. He teaches at the University of New Hampshire. "Things are better than they were during the worst of the recession, but nowhere near where they were before," he said.


California "used to be a state that received people from all over the world and the rest of the United States," said Hans Johnson, senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.

"We're not back to normal," said Brookings Institution's William Frey. He's an expert on population changes. Sunbelt states such as Florida, Arizona and Nevada still aren't attracting as many people as before the recession.

Supervisor Jane Kim said the message she got from Mayor Ed Lee's office is that the city is specifically targeting the site for homeless services because of the Super Bowl. Kim criticized the city's estimated $5 million cost to provide support, including additional police, saying taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for a corporate marketing event. The game itself will take place Feb. 7 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, a Silicon Valley city about 38 miles south of San Francisco.

David Perry works to get the city ready for the Super Bowl. At a community meeting, he said that they will be working more than usual in the next few weeks. He said that teams will be out to help homeless people. He also said that San Francisco wants to make the Super Bowl safe and clean for everyone.


"The homeless outreach team staff informed homeless people in that area that the event will be coming there, that there will be construction, road closures and crowds," Kagan said. "It will be very different than usual for the next few weeks, and the team made sure that the people who live there are aware of that."

The city should offer help all the time, Kim said. It should not help only when it expects lots of visitors come to town.


Christine Falvey, a spokeswoman for Mayor Lee, said homeless people are being approached at the festival site with offers of shelter and longer-term housing because of the winter weather, a citywide effort that includes adding 1,100 beds at emergency shelters. Falvey denied the city is specifically targeting the homeless around Justin Herman Plaza, the heart of the future village, because of plans to build Super Bowl City.

Rachael Kagan works for the city's health department. She said that the homeless are not being asked to leave. Instead, workers have told the homeless that changes are coming. There will be construction and crowds. Things will be different for a few weeks, and the homeless should know that. 


"Shelters are nasty," James said. "Eleven years ago, I stayed in a shelter. It was just a weird feeling."

"It's associated with cold, wet winter," Falvey said. "It is dangerous and unhealthy to live on our streets."


JENNINGS, Mo. — School districts don't usually operate homeless shelters for their students. Nor do they often run food banks or have a system in place to provide whatever clothes kids need. Few offer regular access to pediatricians and mental health counselors, or make washers and dryers available to families desperate to get clean.

JENNINGS, Mo. — In Jennings, Missouri, the school district is different from schools in other places. The school leaders provide food, clothing, shelter and more for their students.


Public education has long felt like a small and fruitless weapon against this town's generational poverty. But that's starting to change. Academic achievement, attendance and high-school graduation rates have improved since Anderson's arrival, and, this month, state officials announced that as a result of the improvements, Jennings had reached full accreditation for the first time in more than a decade.

Students in Jennings have not been doing well in school for a long time. Anderson said that schools can do more to help poor students. She thinks that helping students with things like housing, food and clothes will help them to do well in school.


Together, the siblings rode to the hospital in an ambulance. Paramedics assured Amanda that her brother would be OK, that her brother was in good hands.

Amanda called their mom, Holly Robillard. She immediately drove to the hospital.


Robillard got into her car in Boca Raton and headed north. She said Amanda described her son's injuries as relatively minor, a stitch or two maybe.

Shapiro remembers the moments after the shark attack very clearly.


But then, she thought, why was she making the drive? The 90 minutes from Boca Raton to Fort Pierce seemed like a long way to go for just a few stitches. In her heart she said she knew it was something much more serious.

His pain was really terrible, he said. All he could think about was whether he could ever surf again.


She thought of her son's other surfing accidents. A couple of deep cuts here and there. Once a staple in the head after he hit it hard on his board.

## "I'm Not Scared"


Shapiro has surfed the Treasure Coast since he was 4, she said. He had traveled all over to surf. He was experienced. She started wondering what could have happened, but didn't picture it was a shark attack.

On Tuesday, Shapiro found himself back on the beach. He could not stay away from the water for long. Instead of surfing himself, he was watching his friends surf. In a couple of months, he thinks he will be healed enough to get back on his surfboard.


"You don't think this is ever going to happen," she said. "You always say, 'What are the odds?'"

"I'm not scared," he said. "It wasn't the shark's fault or anything. I'm just trying to get more people to be aware of the water."

Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, issued a statement that said: "Having gone past the brink, the Senate must now embrace the necessity of acting responsibly."

"This is what we fought the Revolution over. Are we going to so blithely give up our freedom? ... I'm not going to take it anymore," Paul said.


Obama supports the USA Freedom Act, which passed the House overwhelmingly May 13.

Senator John McCain complained bitterly to reporters about Paul's actions. Paul cares more about running for president than he does about the safety of the nation, McCain said.


Masayuki Tsukada, 34, who started training to become a sushi chef at 18, shrugs off how there are so few female colleagues.

## "This Tastes So Good"


Ahmed's suspension — his parents have since withdrawn him from the school — reflects the rigid disciplinary policies that many U.S. schools adopted in the 1990s. But many districts, including some of the nation's largest, have been softening their approach, forgoing automatic suspensions, expulsions and calls to the police for one-on-one counseling and less severe forms of punishment.

Ahmed built the special clock himself. He was proud of it and wanted to show it to people. His teacher did not believe him. The police were called, and Ahmed was arrested.


Last year, the Obama administration asked schools to abandon policies that send kids to court, issuing guidelines encouraging training school personnel in conflict resolution.

## Student Clockmaker Forced To Stay Home


The idea: Cultivate communication between teachers and students by gathering in weekly circles to discuss concerns and form one-on-one "harm circles" between students, parents and counselors when conflicts arise.

## Teaching The Teachers


Luciani trained the school's teachers over the next summer. Teachers were instructed to first work on building trust by gathering students weekly and asking questions about their lives. Students talked about relatives that had been killed by gun violence or deported.

Howard Zehr is an expert on restorative justice. He says students learn what they did is wrong when they talk directly to the students they harmed.


"We are not used to having to see this type of deep poverty. We've worked methodically for the past 100 years to get rid of it," said Martin Valfridsson, who was appointed by the government this year to coordinate efforts to deal with the issue.

And the industrial canal has arguably never been particularly good for swimming, starting life as a meandering tidal stream in a swamp more suitable for wading before industrial use started in 1848. This very magazine lauded the new techniques used to turn what was marsh and "waste land" into solid ground in 1872. We also noted, with approval, the canal's use as a sewer in articles in 1892, though C.E. Wilson took to our pages in July of 1911 to worry about the health effects of what he called a "fermenting pool, the odor of which may produce a serious nuisance for considerable distances from its banks." Indeed.

"I don't ever worry about being in the water," he says. His suit acts like a bubble, protecting him, he explains.


You could say that we've been covering the Gowanus from the beginning, and it's clear that for 200 years or more, people have been dumping in the waterway, starting perhaps with those who began to fill in the canal with middens of shells from the then- abundant oysters. After all this time, no one can be sure exactly what's down there, from shipwrecks to cancer-causing pollution or "90 percent guns," as author Jonathan Lethem put it in Motherless Brooklyn.

## No Other Crazy Swimmers


In fact, the EPA even considers living on a houseboat on the canal a potential hazard. When I canoed the canal a few years back, I took extra care to avoid splashing or even touching the water as I got in and out of the canoe.

"I'll jump in if you'll jump in," someone calls out to her friend across the canal. No one accepts the dare. Swain is the only one crazy enough to go in the water.


But in 2008, lead author and University of Chicago paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim was working in Morocco when a Bedouin fossil hunter approached him with a cardboard box of sediment-encrusted bones. Ibrahim looked in the box, noting a strange bladelike fossil with a red line running through it.

The first Spinosaurus dinosaur was discovered in Egypt in 1912. It was studied by German scientist Ernst Stromer, who took the skeleton back to Germany. In 1944 the bones were destroyed in a bombing raid during World War II. Aside from the careful drawings Stromer had made, all evidence of the discovery was lost.


Later, he was visiting a museum in Italy when colleagues told him about some strange fossils in the museum basement, sent from Morocco. "My jaw dropped," Ibrahim said — it was a rich collection of leg, foot and rib bones — and the same strange spines with the red line running through.

## A Box Of Bones, And A Museum


"A barrel falls and 10 minutes later people return to what they were doing," said Muhammad, a young man working at a makeshift gas station: 12 oil drums resting on their sides serving six varieties of gasoline.

In a shoe store, a woman tries on a pair of wedge heels. She decides that they are not comfortable enough to run away in. A 1-year-old with curly hair and big brown eyes speaks mostly in mumbles, but one word she knows clearly: "tabit" — it fell.


The next day people walked by without a glance; the destroyed vehicles had become one more addition to the city's apocalyptic backdrop.

Hours earlier, a barrel bomb had struck a street. It hit three vehicles and killed eight people. With the blood fresh on the sidewalk, motorists stopped and peered at the deadly damage.

## Empty Neighborhoods


CHICAGO, Ill. — For nearly four years, Fatima and Fadi Adris and their family have been fleeing the brutal civil war in their native Syria.

CHICAGO, Ill. — Fatima and Fadi Adris were living happily in Homs, Syria's third-largest city.


So began their desperate flight to safety. At once shocking and all too familiar, their harrowing story of bombings, executions and refugee camps before finding a safe haven in Chicago is just one of thousands coming out of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, the Middle East and Europe.

The family fled to Damascus, the capital of Syria, about 100 miles south. Within five months, the war caught up to them.


Suzanne Akhras Sahloul, 43, who moved to the Chicago area from Syria about 30 years ago, knows the pain of refugees such as the Adrises, the family from Homs. About a year ago, Akhras Sahloul's cousin in Syria was killed by a sniper in front of her children. Around the same time, her sister-in-law's home was destroyed during a bombing, forcing her to flee Syria. And recently, a cousin in his early 20s told relatives he wanted to take a boat from the Turkey refugee camp he was living in to seek asylum in Europe. Family members expressed their alarm and disapproval but haven't heard whether he decided to take that risk.

"They take me to the lake, they take me to the park," said Fatima Adris, the mother from Homs. "I find everything beautiful here. We go walking, we go shopping. We don't feel like we're alone."

Syrian opposition figures decried the agreement, saying it failed to hold Assad accountable for the deaths of hundreds of civilians in chemical weapons attacks. But defected Gen. Salim Idriss, who heads the U.S.-backed Syrian Military Council, said his group would "facilitate" the work of inspectors and would hold its fire when inspectors pass through government-held areas where rebels are fighting. He said under no circumstances, however, would the rebels observe a general cease-fire.

Syria and Assad did not immediately react to the agreement. Syria probably will do what Russia has agreed to. Syria gets most of its weapons from Russia.


The Cultural Heritage Center has a two-year grant to study how historic material is used in conflicts, said Richard Leventhal, the center's executive director.

## Three Years Of War


Damage done by the extremist group Islamic State (ISIL) is clearly intentional. One of their targets, he said, is Christian graves. ISIL "has been destroying these things left, right and center," Daniels said.

## Protecting Museums And Books


The next step is to better establish a timeline for the damage at each site. The ultimate goal, the report said, is to "enable U.S. policymakers and other humanitarian agencies working in conflict zones to design more effective interventions."

The report does not assign blame for the damage. Both the rebel groups and the Assad government are responsible for a lot of destruction, Daniels said.


The U.N. planned to lodge a "strong complaint" with both the government and opposition forces about the shooting, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. The inspectors, who are unarmed, will resume their work Tuesday, and Ban vowed that "the safety and security of the investigation teams will be secured."

The U.N. appeared to have worked out an agreement for safe passage with the two warring sides. No details were released. Each side in the conflict blamed the other for the sniper fire. The civil war in Syria began in March 2011.


Russia has routinely vetoed sanctions against Syria in the United Nations, but Putin did not rule out supporting a U.N. resolution to support military strikes if it's proved that the Syrian regime used chemical weapons.

Sweden's Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said his country wants the United Nations to be involved. It also wants a political solution to the Syrian civil war, not a military one.


"We work, we argue about some issues. We are human. Sometimes one of us gets vexed. But I would like to repeat once again that global mutual interests form a good basis for finding a joint solution to our problems," Putin said.

Obama canceled a meeting he was supposed to have with Putin in Russia. The president is meeting with the leaders of Japan, China and France.


Still, Putin said his "working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust," and he welcomed Obama's willingness to work with Russia on a plan to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control.

But Putin blasted American exceptionalism. That is the idea that there is something different and special about America. He also said he studied what Obama said Tuesday night about Syria. He disagrees with the president.


Mustard gas was the first chemical weapon ever used in warfare, during World War I in Europe. Mustard gas causes damage to the respiratory system and can lead to choking. The gas can also soak through uniforms and burn skin.

During the Vietnam War, the United States used napalm against its enemies. Napalm can burn leaves off of trees. During the war, U.S. troops had trouble finding North Vietnamese soldiers in leafy jungles. They used napalm to clear out the jungles. This way they could find their enemies faster.


Camp residents heard Obama reveal his decision to postpone the operation on live broadcasts of his announcement Saturday, carried by Arabic-language television channels received over the satellite dishes that sprout like mushrooms atop the dwellings lining Zaatari's trash-strewn streets.

The refugees in Zaatari were excited that an attack would happen late last week. The United States signaled that cruise-missile strikes would happen any day. U.S. officials said that they were highly confident that the Assad government was behind an Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack. The attack took place in a town near Damascus that is held by rebels. It killed at least 1,429 people who were not soldiers.


Fadil Issa, 35, who has been in Zaatari since leaving his village near Daara eight months ago, said many refugees think Obama called off the U.S. strikes for fear they could have triggered hostilities between the United States and Iran, one of Assad's main allies.

"Everybody was watching," said Zoubi, 23, a baker from Taybeh, a village outside Daara. The anti-Assad protests that led to the civil war erupted there on March 18, 2011.


The buses were preceded by a truck hauling a trailer with windows cut into its sides and stairs that swung down from the rear. It appeared to be bringing rebel fighters back into Syria as only men and teenage boys swarmed into the trailer, some pushing their bags through the windows before clambering through, others crushing their way up the stairs into the rear.

## "We're Not Afraid"


Plans call for trucking the arsenal from a series of collection sites to the Syrian port of Latakia, where it will be loaded into 150 Teflon-lined shipping containers. Pentagon planners fear that even a heavily guarded convoy could be attacked en route to Latakia.

## Chemicals Loaded Into Containers


Tiny Lebanon is now home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees, officials say; that means that about 1 in 5 residents of the country is a Syrian who has fled the civil war next door. Aid groups have applauded Lebanon's generosity in permitting the entry of so many.

The sun was shining Sunday in the Bekaa. Mountain tops were covered with snow. But the views were of little relief to displaced Syrians. Many of them were clearing out the snow, slush and mud that had made an already difficult life even harder.


As the Syrian war enters its third winter, desperate refugees in Lebanon who cannot afford apartments or don't have loved ones to host them face grim prospects. The scores of provisional camps that have sprung up provide for basic needs but are far from reliable. Aid arrives irregularly, and in haphazard fashion, refugees say, despite the work of United Nations relief teams and humanitarian agencies. Many tents have heating stoves, but fuel has been in short supply.

Aid groups have praised Lebanon for letting so many Syrians come to the country. But Lebanon has no established refugee camps. Syria's other neighbors like Turkey, Jordan and Iraq do. Refugee camps are not allowed in Lebanon.


"People are marrying off their daughters for as little as 100 Jordanian dinars ($70) because of the bad circumstances inside the camp in return for money," said Marwa al-Saloumy, who works on women's issues for a regional advocacy group called Al-Zahra.

"They ask us where the office is to buy a Syrian woman, as if they are buying a chicken. They don't believe us when we tell them it doesn't exist," said Khalid, who said he is 26. "Our women are not for sale. We are here because we did not want to be killed."


After the conflict began, the Mardini family moved around to avoid the fighting and tried to ensure their daughters could keep on swimming. Ysra, now 17, even represented Syria at the short-course world championships in Turkey in 2012. But as the war intensified fellow swimmers drifted away.

"Everything was good," said 20-year-old Sarah. "That was before the war."


Eventually, the sisters made it to Austria and then Germany. Shortly after arriving in Berlin a local charity put them in touch with the Wasserfreunde Spandau 04, a swimming club based near their refugee shelter.

## A Tough Time At Sea


Her older sister, meanwhile, is battling bureaucracy to bring the rest of the family to Germany. In the pool, she prefers long-distance swimming.

Sven Spannekrebs, their coach, says the sisters are doing very well.


The family's journey has been one of hardship and heartbreak: braving choppy Mediterranean waters in a dinghy to Greece; trekking through Balkan cornfields with no water in scorching heat; jumping across barbed wire in fear of Hungarian border police; paying Romanian smugglers thousands of euros (dollars) to take them to Berlin in a minibus; spending countless sleepless nights in asylum centers with unspeakably filthy toilets.

Today, she is happy in Germany. The family now has a small apartment that they can decorate and make their own. 


Now they are living a new dream in Germany. Currently, their new dream is playing out to the tune of Yuletide cheer. At the Christmas market, there's a long line in front of a stand with Dresden yeast bread, which looks tempting, with its melted cheese and sour cream topping. But once the family discovers it contains tiny bits of bacon — definitely not halal — they opt instead for a vendor selling gingerbread hearts, glazed apples and cotton candy.

All that feels like a bad dream now.


These happy mornings, Khawla Kareem gets up before dawn, makes herself a strong Arabic coffee and listens to the tunes of Lebanese star Fairuz just like she did in Damascus — explaining that the start to her day would be incomplete without the legendary singer's voice.

"Our big dream is still Berlin," Reem says.

"I bandage it with the upright posture of a Syrian woman who is not bent by bereavement, poverty, or displacement as she rises from the banquets of death and carries on shepherding life's rituals. She prepares for a creeping, ravenous winter and gathers the heavy firewood branches, stick by stick from the frigid wilderness. She does not cut a tree, does not steal, does not surrender her soul to weariness, does not ask anyone's charity, does not fold with the load, and does not yield midway."

It's no accident that the tablet will hit the market just weeks before the release of "How to Train Your Dragon 2," the sequel to DreamWorks Animation's 2010 hit. The tie-ins include animated interactive videos and games based on "Shrek," "Kung Fu Panda" and "Madagascar."

Stepka doesn't plan to switch to the new DreamTab because he already owns six Nabi devices. Although his children certainly use them to have fun, he said, the most important thing to him is that they learn and stay safe while using the technology.

It's nice to "have a penguin tell the kid it's time to go outside," said Jim Mainard of DreamWorks Animation. That's better, he said, than the parent having to "take the tablet away."

On Tuesday afternoon, when Tsai showed up in sleepy Lukang to help boost her party's local parliamentary candidate, the film director Chen Wen-bin, the streets were hardly thronged with people. As Chen and Tsai set off in a caravan including a loudspeaker truck, rolling past pineapple vendors, women shucking oysters and roadside temples swirled in the smoke of smoldering incense, the overseas returnees sprung into action.

For many years, the United States and other countries said the Nationalists were the real ruler of China. That situation has changed. China has become very rich. Communist leaders in China have used its power to press many countries to ignore Taiwan. China continues to insist that Taiwan and the mainland are part of "one China" and must be reunited some day.


"As Moscow once again intends to gain control over the peninsula, the Tatars become the most vulnerable people in Crimea because we support the interim government and the territorial integrity of Ukraine," said Mustafa Dzhemilev, a Crimean Tatar activist and member of the Ukrainian parliament.

"If somebody tells me today that another deportation is possible, I would tell him that he is an idiot," said Jafer Abdulkerimov. He is a frail 81-year-old man. He has bright eyes, a steady voice, and an excellent memory.


"In today's situation, the Russians will most likely be forced to eventually stop their occupation and leave," she said, "but our people are traditionally ready to prepare themselves for the worst."

Again, "the Tatars become the most (powerless) people in Crimea," said Mustafa Dzhemilev. He is a Crimean Tatar activist and member of the Ukrainian parliament.


"No threats exist today for the residents of the republic," Vladimir Konstantinov said, promising the Tatar community power that "they had never enjoyed before."

In December, Aksenov reportedly led a group of Russians who rioted in neighborhoods where Tatars were building homes. They destroyed many of the buildings with sledgehammers.


"When they deported my father's and mother's families in 1944, all our grown men were at the front and couldn't protect them," said Emir Shevkiev, a 25-year-old philologist and member of the local Tatar community. "We are here and we will fight back."
"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin. He carried a Russian flag. "Now that our people are in power here we won't allow any separatism inside our republic."


"What I worry about is that as long as we continue to cling to ONE (white) MAN'S view of life as he lived it so long ago, we (perhaps unwittingly) promote the notion that other cultural perspectives are less important," she wrote.

Nearly all of Burbank High School students are nonwhites. Also, about 4 out of 5 students qualified for free or reduced-price lunches because their families did not make enough money.

The all-boys class of fifth-graders in North Charleston, S.C., where John Helton, a 50-year-old retired Coast Guard commander, teaches loves to hear stories from his three-decade career: tales of rough seas, rescues at sea and Cold War-era submarines deep under the sea.

Helton enlisted in the Navy and served for more than 10 years on submarines.

If Japanese retailer Uniqlo is looking for more space in American malls, there may be sites opening up soon. Same for U.K. clothing chain Topshop and Swedish retailer H&amp;M, both of which have been expanding in North America.

U.S. teen clothing retailers are closing dozens of stores.


No one could accuse the chains of not taking the issue seriously, even if they might have been a little slower than some would like.

## International Shops Are Doing Well


In 1999, slightly more than 52 percent of teens 16 to 19 worked a summer job. By this year, that number had plunged to about 32.25 percent over June and July. It means that slightly more than 3 in 10 teens actually worked a summer job, out of a universe of roughly 16.8 million U.S. teens.

But it didn't happen.


Summer is traditionally the peak period of employment for teens as they are off from school and get their first brush with employment and the responsibilities that come with it. Falling teen employment, however, is just as striking in the 12-month numbers over the past decade.

## "Great Depression For Teens"


Life is filled with contrasts for Cavalin, a 17-year-old from San Gabriel, California, who has dashed by major milestones as his age seems to lag behind. He graduated from community college at age 11. Four years later, he had a bachelor's degree in math from the University of California, Los Angeles.

"I needed an intern who knew software and knew mathematical algorithms," Arteaga says. "And I also needed a pilot who could fly it on a Cessna."

## Farewell, Physics. Hello, Coding


In conversation, Cavalin speaks with the even cadence and diction of someone who chooses his words with care. He's unflappable, at least until he discusses his distaste for being called a certain word: "One word I don't take too kindly is genius," he said. "Genius is just kind of taking it too far."

"For the first time, I was like, poetry is normal!" Enamorado says. "I felt completely at home. And the creativity, the subjects were eye-opening."

"Everyone has such vast knowledge — I feel like I have so many books open to me," says Roach. "I've changed in that I know how to say what I'm feeling."

The hurdle: Finding enough tumors to test. Only about 200 people a year worldwide are diagnosed, according to the Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation, which helped fund the new study. There was no registry that kept tissue samples after surgery.

As for Elana Simon, she plans to study computer science at Harvard next fall.
The New York Genome Center zeroed in on the weird change in the gene.


"If there is video of him going over the fence, why was there no response?" asked Jenkins, who also directs the National Transportation Security Center at the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State.

"We have 1,050 acres," Rosemary Barnes said. She is the spokeswoman for the airport. "That's a lot of fence line. He could have scaled the fence line really through any area here at the airport. It's very easy to do so under the cover of darkness, and it appears that's what he did."


—A man dressed as a woman jumped a security fence at Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, and the intrusion, although captured on video, went undetected for a day, according to reports.

— A driver crashed through a gate onto the runway at Philadelphia airport.


—An inebriated 49-year-old man climbed a fence at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix and ran across the tarmac.

— A jet skier came out of the water and walked across two runways past cameras and motion detectors at JFK International Airport in New York.


Some airports use infrared or radar perimeter sensing systems while others rely on video cameras or even guard dogs and police patrols. No matter how sophisticated the security systems, they ultimately depend on individuals watching monitors, experts said, citing studies that found the attention span of someone watching a bank of 30 monitors is half an hour at best.

— A 16-year-old stowaway got into a Boston-bound airplane's wheel well in Charlotte, N.C. He was killed when the wheel well opened.


Airport spokeswoman Barnes said Mineta's security program "involves many components, including outer perimeter fencing, surveillance video equipment and more than 2,800 badge employees" trained to report security concerns to law enforcement and airport operations.

Based on his study's findings, Piquero said he hopes the government will do more to give disadvantaged teens opportunity to be productive citizens. That means a bigger emphasis on education and jobs, he said.

## A Pat On The Back


Chad Houser has seen how the opportunity to do an honest day's work, combined with a simple pat on the back, can make all the difference for disadvantaged juvenile offenders.

In their world, an early death is possible, said Houser. They see it all around them. Houser said he's never heard a teen talk about living beyond age 20.


In their world, an early death isn't just a possibility — it's a reality they accept. Houser said he's never heard a teen talk about living beyond age 20.

"It works in every case," Houser said. "When you give them hope and encouragement and literally, as silly as it sounds, a pat on the back, a 'good job,' it changes their" attitude.


According to American Family Insurance, 15,000 families have used the DriveCam in 19 states since it launched in 2007. The company has recorded 65 percent to 70 percent reductions among participants in distractions, tailgating, poor scanning, intentionally unsafe driving and speeding.

Olier said she was the only one among her peers with a driving monitor. In interviews with Milwaukee-area families, many felt they interfered with the trust they had with their children.


"You need to teach them and then trust them to be able to do the right thing," said Mary Beth Mills of Fox Point, Wis., whose 16-year-old son is learning to drive.

"Forecasting the End," according to promotional materials, is about how "catastrophic weather or natural disasters could possibly cause the end of days." A "Did You Know" section on the show's website warns viewers that "one fiery spark" of methane gas "could ignite global destruction."

## "It Just Feeds On Itself"


But thinking beyond the cave level was also needed. Starting in the late 1990s, Getty specialists, Chinese government cultural heritage authorities and the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage worked to establish the China Principles — national guidelines for cultural heritage conservation and management. In a country with vast numbers of historic sites but an often hodgepodge and unscientific approach to preservation, such parameters filled a critical void.

## A Cave Expert's View


Archaeologists know very little about the mountain city of Teotihuacan. The tunnel, discovered 11 years ago under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent at the heart of the ancient metropolis, is the latest piece in a puzzle dating back to before Europeans arrived in the New World. "These findings are very important, both for the quantity and the quality of materials being discovered," wrote George Cowgill, a professor at Arizona State University in Tempe who directs a research center at Teotihuacan, in an e-mail. It will probably take years of analysis to truly understand the significance of each object and the assemblage, he added.

The tunnel was first discovered in 2003. It is located beneath an important religious building, the Temple of the Feathered Serpent.


Gomez's team is in the process of excavating the rooms down to the floors and it is possible there are nobles buried in the detritus or even below the chamber floors. He expects the work to continue and remains optimistic that a body will be found. "It's very exciting because it corroborates our hypothesis that this could be an offering for something more important that lies beneath. And the hypothesis is that there is a burial site but we won't know for sure until next year."
Neither images of Teotihuacan's kings nor royal tombs have yet been discovered. If a royal tomb is found somewhere in the tunnel, it might provide much new information about life in the ancient city.


"We're not looking at going through a back door or being nefarious," he said.

Kik, one of the app companies, is based in Canada. It says it has more than 200 million users in 230 countries, including 40 percent of American youths. Kik's website states that the text of Kik conversations is stored only on the phones of Kik users. Kik does not see or store chat message texts. It also cannot get the information off someone's phone.

On Wednesday night, Woahloe, a registered nurse, appeared with several Liberian pastors and community leaders to spread the word: Please don't blame Liberians.

"Go back to Liberia."


"Is the community concerned for its image?"

"Do you know the Ebola patient?"


Gaye said the last thing Liberians need is to be stigmatized.

"Where is the patient's family?"


One of the women who called her said she had to go home, Woahloe said. "And I told her, 'Don't go anywhere. Just go to work.'"
Don't point a finger at Liberia, Jimmy Sando, an airport worker, pleaded.


But nowhere is the impact of the recent surge of immigration felt more strongly than in Texas.

## Most Children Stay In Texas


One Salvadoran father recently brought his 13-year-old daughter to Moreno's office in tears. He left for the United States when the girl was 4 months old. Now she had made the trek north and was running wild, testing his temper.

One 14-year-old Honduran boy traveled as far as Guadalajara, Mexico, with his mother. Then she ran out of money and told him to hop cargo trains, alone, the rest of the way to the United States.


And when it comes to the Civil War, children are supposed to learn that the conflict was caused by "sectionalism, states' rights and slavery" — written deliberately in that order to telegraph slavery's secondary role in driving the conflict, according to some members of the State Board of Education.

The books leave out a lot of history. The books do not say much about the unfair treatment of blacks in the South. They also do not say that the Civil War between the Northern and Southern states 150 years ago was caused mainly by slavery.


Hardy, the Texas state board member who said the war was not about slavery, did not respond to requests for comment. The board's chairwoman, Donna Bahorich, also did not respond to a request for comment.

The Civil War happened only because 11 Southern states were determined to defend the right to own other human beings, Grossman said. "The Civil War was fought over the issue of slavery."


"If you don't know about the Civil War, and you don't know about things like slavery, then you wouldn't really be able to understand why our society is the way it is today," Cevallos said.

Stephen Wright is an eighth-grade teacher in Nacogdoches, a small Texas town. He said some Texas students leave class not knowing that slavery was the main cause of the Civil War. His students know the truth, he said.


"I think we are at last seeing the de-Confederatization of America," Loewen said. "And I'm hoping that we will see some action towards de-Confederatizing our textbooks."

"Man, it's all about slavery," he said. "The students know that."

## The Government's Addition And Subtraction


Minister of Education Hector Rodriguez defended the books this fall, and urged critics to work with the government to improve the collection.

Hector Cuevas was shocked when his son brought home his sixth-grade books. He said the books are changing the country's history to how the government wants people to see it. They are brainwashing children, said Cuevas, who works with technology.


"Certainly they can be improved, like any human endeavor," he said, according to Venezuelan news website Noticias24. "Those who want to criticize should read the books, and when they find an error they should let us know to correct it."

"That is excellent!" the student's partner replies.

## Teachers Do Not Have A Choice


Twenty-one percent of drivers between the ages of 15 and 19 who are involved in fatal crashes were distracted by the use of cellphones, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Eleven percent of all drivers under age 20 who are involved in fatal crashes were reported as distracted (whether by texting, phone calls, radio or other sources) at the time of the crash -- the largest percentage of any age group -- according to the U.S. Department of Transportation website distraction.gov.




Earlier this month, Text Kills became even more serious about its mission. It filed papers to become a 501(c)3 nonprofit and began a crowd-sourced fundraising campaign on the website Indiegogo.com (igg.me/at/textkills), to raise cash for a documentary it intends to make available to schools across the country.

Life is imitating art in Thailand, where muzzled opponents of the coup leaders who suspended democracy six months ago have embraced the three-finger salute of defiance from the "Hunger Games" movie series.

Life is imitating a movie in Thailand. Students there are using a hand signal from the "Hunger Games" movies to protest against the military. Now, officials have banned the three-finger salute and have arrested young demonstrators for using it.


Human rights advocates have condemned the Thai authorities' attempts to suppress even symbolic gestures of protest.

The Chinese government held back "Mockingjay" from the country's theaters until next year, said the magazine Variety. It wasn't clear if that was because of the movie's popularity with pro-democracy activists. Chinese officials have been dealing with protests for greater democracy in Hong Kong for over a month.


The group, founded in 1977 by Canadian activist Paul Watson, is best known as the subject of the reality TV show "Whale Wars," which has documented its often extreme efforts to thwart Japanese whalers in the Antarctic Ocean. The whalers sued Sea Shepherd, leading to a 2013 injunction that memorably referred to the activists as pirates without "a peg leg or an eye patch," and forbade their ships from coming near the whalers' vessels.

She said, "There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families."


Given her belief in a small state and lack of government help, it also meant that workers in these areas struggled to find new employment, especially as Thatcher's government was reluctant to invest in training or other opportunities.

## Winning Wars


Thatcher resigned as prime minister in November 1990 and had been unwell for several years before her death. When she died, the current Prime Minister David Cameron said, "As our first woman prime minister, Margaret Thatcher succeeded against all the odds. Margaret Thatcher didn't just lead our country. She saved our country."

He said, "Every real problem we face today is the legacy of the fact she was fundamentally wrong."

## Disney Magic: Make Reservations At Home


PHILADELPHIA — In China, Maura Cunningham says, if you're going to hold an online discussion of the Tiananmen Square massacre, you better speak in code.

PHILADELPHIA — China's Tianamen Square changed forever during a few weeks in spring 1989. Hu Yaobang had just died and young people went to march on the square in mourning. Yaobang was a popular leader in China because he had changed many old rules and was making the government more modern.


On Thursday, Cunningham, 31, will explore new and ominous shifts in digital media and dissent at what's expected to be a crowded St. Joseph's University conference on Tiananmen, timed to the 25th anniversary of the 1989 protests.

## "May 35th"


The symposium, called "Tiananmen at 25," is free and open to the public. It gathers some of the world's top experts on the massacre and kicks off what promises to be a season of international remembrance.

Don't mention "June 4th," the date that tanks rolled against unarmed protesters. Instead, try "May 35th" — a count of that month's 31 days plus four in June. It's a way to avoid the lurking presence of the government, and to prevent what you've written from being removed.


Lim, speaking to about 100 people in Mandeville Hall on Wednesday, described the Communist Party's successful effort to scrub the history and memory of Tiananmen from society.

"The Internet is a bigger and bigger part of life in China," Cunningham said in an interview. "But it's becoming more and more complicated."


"It's vital that we keep the memory and lessons of those weeks alive," conference organizer James Carter, a St. Joseph's China expert, said in a statement, "partly to understand China more fully, but also to prevent the people who died standing up for their beliefs from being erased from history."

## Blocking Websites


A few years ago, neighbors erected a small shrine to the king over a stream next door.

Gonpo and her husband left the farm. They moved to a town in eastern China and settled into a quiet life. Gonpo went to college and got a job teaching. She had two daughters. The community around them knew nothing about Gonpo's royal history.


In 1949, Mao Zedong's Communists established the People's Republic of China, and the following year his People's Liberation Army invaded central Tibet. Having seen the ease with which the Chinese rolled into Lhasa, Gonpo's father instructed his people to not resist the Chinese.

## A Short Stay Lasts For Decades


In the new study, scientists collected blood samples from 40 Tibetans and sequenced more than 30,000 nucleotides on a segment of DNA containing EPAS1, the gene that makes Tibetans so well-suited for life at high altitude. Then the scientists compared that sequence with those of 1,000 individuals representing the 26 human populations in the Human Genome Diversity Panel. They found the high-altitude gene in only two of the 40 Han Chinese people in the panel and no one else.

No one knew the Denisovans ever roamed the Earth until four years ago. It was then that an unusual finger bone was unearthed in a part of Siberia, Russia, near its border with China.


Although previous studies had identified the importance of EPAS1, scientists still don't know exactly what the gene does. They know only that it leads to lower levels of hemoglobin — the oxygen-toting protein in blood — in Tibetans who live at high altitude compared with people from low elevations who have acclimatized.

## How Did The Gene Travel?


The Chinese government also has sought to improve the public's attitude toward tigers by compensating farmers for pilfered livestock. Liu, for example, expects to receive about $500 for the young bull killed in June. Chinese newspapers now contain a multitude of articles about tiger attacks on farms, further raising awareness.

## Many Revere The Tiger


"If you want to protect tigers, you have to protect their food supply," Zhang Changzhi, a scientist with the World Wildlife Fund, which is sponsoring the project, said as he toured a preserve in Wangqing county recently.

"We never go out into the mountains now alone. We are always in groups of two or three so there is somebody to scare off the tiger," said Qi Shuyan, 46. He works on the same ranch in Jintang as Liu.


The practice threatens the last remaining habitat of the Amur tiger, sometimes called the Siberian tiger. The oak trees, many of them centuries old, play a particularly important role in the food chain on which the tiger depends.

## Breaking the Food Chain


"U.S. consumers can unwittingly be contributing to this," said Linda Walker of the WWF. Other trees illegally logged and sent to China include Manchurian ash and Manchurian linden. All are similar to wood grown in the United States. They are sent to China for use in finished products that are then exported to the United States.

"No expert in the world can tell (the difference) from looking at the wood said Nikolay Shmatkov. He works for the WWF in Moscow. He was in Washington, D.C., to talk about Russian logging. Illegal loggers have threatened WWF officials watching forests in Russia, he said.

Deutsch's model isn't the only one around, however. In 2009 Seth Lloyd, a theorist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed an alternative, less radical model of CTCs that resolves the grandfather paradox using quantum teleportation and a technique called post-selection, rather than Deutsch's quantum self-consistency. With Canadian collaborators, Lloyd went on to perform successful laboratory simulations of his model in 2011. "Deutsch's theory has a weird effect of destroying correlations," Lloyd says. "That is, a time traveler who emerges from a Deutschian CTC enters a universe that has nothing to do with the one she exited in the future. By contrast, post-selected CTCs preserve correlations, so that the time traveler returns to the same universe that she remembers in the past."

Here is how Deutsch fixes the grandfather paradox:


The companies are concerned about child labor in their supply chains and have developed standards, including requiring growers to provide a safe work environment and adhere to child labor laws, the group said.

U.S. agriculture labor laws allow children to work at younger ages and in more hazardous conditions than children in any other industry. Children as young as 12 can be hired to work on a farm of any size. And children of any age can work on small farms.


Benitez and seven other workers, mostly young men like himself, began meeting at the Catholic church where many attended Mass, Our Lady Of Guadalupe, a cream-colored set of buildings inside Immokalee's nine-block downtown.

## Students Joined Taco Bell Protest


They walked door-to-door to poll their neighbors: What changes would you like to see in Immokalee? Are you interested in working toward a solution?

The workers decided to see if Taco Bell would agree to pay more.


They invited neighbors to their Wednesday night meetings at the church. They created a low-power radio station, Radio Conciencia, or "Radio of Awareness." They opened a co-op to offer food and other basics at reasonable prices.

The coalition wrote to Taco Bell, but did not hear anything back. 


But according to the FBI, they also "threatened (the immigrants) at gunpoint, promising torture and death if they tried to escape. And they made them live in filthy, substandard, and overcrowded apartments."

Two big companies still refuse to pay more. One is Wendy's, and the other is Publix.


The team then turned to the fossil record, examining two fish — Psarolepis from China and Andreolepis from Sweden — that are more than 400 million years old. In Andreolepis, only the scales showed signs of enamel. In Psarolepsis, even though scales on the face carried enamel, the teeth themselves did not.

## Scale Enamel, Tooth Enamel Essentially The Same


"(The findings) show us the strange paths that evolution can take, co-opting a tissue from one part of the body to play a quite different role in another, and then abandoning the original role altogether," he said. "Looking at our own teeth, and the important role that enamel plays in their function, you would swear that the tissue had evolved there; and yet it did not."
According to Ahlberg, this showed that ganoine "was, indeed, enamel."

California hasn't asked for his help, and Musk's dream exists only on paper.

On Monday, Musk unveiled the design of his Hyperloop, a $6 billion high-speed transportation system powered by the sun. The line would travel up to 760 miles per hour (mph) and have the feel of an airliner, Musk said. Capsules would hold 28 people each.


By contrast, the California bullet train system envisions a much bigger annual ridership: about 20 million at minimum. The plan, however, has been sharply disputed by outside experts who doubt that large numbers of drivers or airline passengers will be attracted to the bullet train.

The Hyperloop's design is still in its early stages. It would be a trip across the 382 miles, connecting two stations. More stations could be added later. Musk said the system could transport 7.4 million people a year.

Julian Rademeyer, author of "Killing for Profit," a book about poaching in southern Africa, said professional hunters face huge pressure to ensure that foreign hunters bag the big trophies they're after. Professional hunters in Zimbabwe were arrested for their role in the bowhunting death of Cecil, a large, dominant lion, by American dentist Walter Palmer.

Craig Packer runs the Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota. He has led studies showing that overhunting is the main reason for the steep drop in lions in Tanzania. It is the biggest lion-hunting country in Africa. He believes the real problem is that hunters prefer large male lions.


However, only about 2,800 of South Africa's lions are wild. Nearly 70 percent are captive bred, often used as cubs in petting zoos, then sold off to "canned hunting" outfits where foreign trophy hunters pick off semi-tame lions fenced into small areas, in a practice likened to dynamiting fish.

Kenya outlawed hunting in 1977. Yet the lion population there has dropped from 15,000 to about 2,000 in 15 years. Hunters says this proves that they are not the problem. In Kenya, lions roam free. Some Kenyans kill them with poison to protect their cattle.


"It's a great day when you can bring back a species from extinction," said Dunn, a technology consultant from Truckee. "It's kind of sad these events are so rare."

## The Return Of The One That Got Away


"An Indian brought in a large fish to trade which we had the inexpressible satisfaction to find was a salmon-trout," Fremont wrote in his journal.

What she discovered rocked the fishing community: No DNA more closely matched the museum samples than the Pilot Peak cutthroat. A lost legend had been found.

The most common crime is still the "straight theft" of trailers left unattended in parking lots or at truck stops. But CargoNet says the new trucking scams are growing at a rapid 6 percent each quarter. Of the average three to five truckloads stolen each day in the United States, at least one involves what are known in the industry as fraudulent or fictitious pickups.

Food and drinks were the most commonly stolen goods, accounting for almost a fourth of all thefts last year. This was followed by metals, electronics and household goods.


Trump declined to refer to the program by name on Nov. 11 in an interview on "The O'Reilly Factor." ''I don't like the term at all," he said.

He praised the 1950s program again during the Republican debate on Nov. 10. Trump is a Republican. Whoever wins the Republican nomination would run for president against a Democrat. The Democrats are in the White House now. President Barack Obama is a Democrat. But Obama is not running for re-election. The Democratic presidential candidates include Hillary Rodham Clinton, a U.S. secretary of state, U.S. senator and first lady, as well as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin O'Malley, who used to be the governor of Maryland.


In an interview on Nov. 11 on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Trump indicated he would take a similar approach. "You're going to have a deportation force, and you're going to do it humanely," he said.

## Death And Dumping In Mexico


Trump touted the approach as a virtue of the Eisenhower-era program in the Nov. 10 debate.

## Trump Silent On Some Matters


The idea announced by Trump on Monday evening drew swift rebukes, some from abroad. British Prime Minister David Cameron slammed it as "divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong." Muslims in the United States and around the world denounced the idea unconstitutional or offensive.

## Compared To Roosevelt And Hitler


Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trump's proposed ban would apply to "everybody," including Muslims seeking immigration visas as well as tourists seeking to enter the country.

On Fox News, Trump said Muslim members of the U.S. armed forces would "come home." His plan would "not apply to people living in the country."


Judy Clarke, the defense attorney who bluntly stated "It was him" during her opening statements, used her closing argument to paint a picture of the older brother as Tsarnaev's "sole source of family, of support, of strength." She described the older brother as bigger and possessing more charisma, laying out examples of how Dzhokhar was influenced by Tamerlan.

## Tsarnaev "Didn't Care For A Second"


Clarke also described Tsarnaev's "potential for redemption," pointing to the testimony earlier last week of Sister Helen Prejean, a Roman Catholic nun and death-penalty opponent. And Clarke ultimately told the jurors that each of them was a safeguard against a death sentence.

Steven Mellin is a government lawyer, known as a prosecutor. He said that Tsarnaev did not value the lives of his victims. Tsarnaev "didn't care for a second what impact his actions and his killings would have on so many other innocent family members and friends," Mellin told the jury. "His actions have earned him a sentence of death."


Ultimately, as O'Toole outlined last week, each juror had to decide what they individually believed after the trial. It took about 14 hours of deliberations before every juror agreed on a verdict that would make Tsarnaev the 62nd person on federal death row.
"The law values life," Clarke said to the jury. She told them that they do not have to vote for death.


The Synthetic Turf Council, an industry group, declined an interview request. A statement on its website reads: "The preponderance of evidence shows no negative health effects associated with crumb rubber in synthetic turf."

The EPA published the study on its website. Now, the agency has a message on the website that says the study is "very limited." It warns readers that the study only looked at four sites. The EPA stated that more data might need to be examined.


Meanwhile, turkeys that nobly roam landfill woods never join the countless birds that fight over dump desserts like gnarly chicken bones.

## Fit To Be Wild


Full disclosure: Turkeys also bully – themselves. They are known to catch their reflections on the side of a car and have a go at that mirrored bad-boy.

Franklin was said to be upset that the symbol of the nation is a thief. It will wait in a tree while an osprey works to snatch a fish from the water. Then the eagle will swoop in. It will scare the osprey until it drops its meal, then do some fast take-out.


A wild turkey captured for medical care or relocation may display a truly wild spirit, all but flailing itself to death to escape.

## Eagle Eyes For Fast Food


As numbers rose, their behavior shifted from rodent hunter to refuse specialist. State biologist Michelle Vandeventer suspects eagles are at least partly drawn to landfills for companionship and loafing.

If there is something truly American about the eagles at Florida landfills, it's that they like all-you-can-eat fast food.


"Education is an ideological tool," said Sakine Esen Yilmaz, secretary-general of the left-leaning Education and Science Laborer's Union. "It is (now) being used to raise an obedient generation that will serve the government."

The country's first president tried to make the country more secular. Schools banned Islamic headscarves. Traditional Islamic women wear the scarves to cover their heads.


The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the mandatory religion classes are an affront to Alevi students' religious freedoms. The government insists that the course teaches general knowledge about all faiths — a claim dismissed by critics who say that Sunni teachings still dominate the syllabus.

President Erdogan supports adding Ottoman language classes at high schools. Ottoman is an older version of Turkish. It was abandoned when the country tried to become more Western.


Guvener says the school in Diyarbakir, in offering only three elective religious classes, claimed implausibly that there was no demand for any other electives at the school.

Yalcin denies schools are trying to force religion on the students. What they are trying to do is offer religious education. It's what the people want, he said.


Yalcin, of the pro-government teachers union, denies a deliberate move to force religion on the students through the elective classes.

The real problems in schools are being brushed aside, said Sakine Esen Yilmaz. He is a leader of the Education and Science Laborer's Union, a group that does not like religion in schools.


"The aim is to open the way to elective religious education, in line with the wishes of the people," he said. "There is no question of forcing the classes on students."

Yilmaz said teachers have classes with 50 to 60 students. Schools have no labs, libraries or sports facilities, he said.


No miner has been brought out alive since dawn Wednesday from the Soma coal mine where the explosion and fire took place. Many mourners said they spent their whole lives fearing something like this.

## Erdogan Ducks Into Supermarket


Erdogan, who is expected to soon announce his candidacy for Turkey's presidential election in August, was not welcome during his visit to the area Wednesday. He was forced to take refuge at a supermarket after angry crowds called him a murderer and a thief, in a reference to alleged corruption, and clashed with police.

On Thursday, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz announced that a fire inside the mine was dying down. He said rescuers would soon speed up their search for the missing.


Erdogan appeared somewhat tone-deaf to residents' grief Wednesday, calling mining accidents "ordinary things" that occur in many other countries after giving examples of 19th-century mine accidents in Britain.

Turkish President Abdullah Gul called the mining accident "a huge disaster."


Police had moved in from the city's Besiktas district in the early morning, when only a few thousand demonstrators remained on the square after more than a week of occupation. Istanbul's Taksim Square has become the center of recent anti-government protests, which started as a demonstration against a building project in the square's Gezi Park but have since grown into widespread condemnation of the government's conservative policies. Although many of the protesters scattered after the morning clash, many reconnected online and vowed to return. Initially, as they approached in the evening, police backed off, standing to one side of the square.

## City On Two Continents


"Turkish police have fired their tear gas guns directly at people during the demonstrations of the last days. They have used it like a projectile weapon. That's why there are so many severe injuries," association president Metin Feyzioglu told the German news agency dpa. He said lawyers were simply trying to make prosecutors aware. Instead, he said, they had security forces used against them.

## Pulling Down A Park For A Shopping Mall


In a televised speech to members of his ruling conservative Islamic Justice and Development Party in Ankara, Erdogan paid tribute to the police leadership and accused demonstrators of widespread vandalism during the course of the two-week occupation of the square and park.

## Violent Removal


"Erdogan hasn't understood anything," said one protester at Taksim Square. "I was afraid it would come to this."

## Secret Police Starting A Fight?


Istanbul Governor Huseyin Avni Mutlu wrote on Twitter that the purpose of the operation was only to remove banners from a monument to Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's first president, and the Ataturk Cultural Center.

## "What Should We Have Done?"


Police would not move into Gezi Park — situated within the square — where thousands of demonstrators have camped out, he said, while asking the demonstrators to remain calm and not provoke police.

Erdogan promised to "pursue" the demonstrators who he described as "terrorists." No one will escape, he also threatened. "What should we have done?" the prime minister asked. "Kneeled down in front of these people and asked them to please remove their banners?"


"Turtles have evolved a way to use the inclination angle of the geomagnetic field, and its intensity to give them almost an internal GPS," said J. Roger Brothers, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina and the first author on the paper.

## Beach Straight Ahead!


Named for the color of their fatty tissue, green turtles go about nesting in a peculiar way. Their nest counts predictably are up and down every other year.

## Big Heads, Long Lives


Since 2010, loggerhead nest counts at the index sites have amounted to a rebound. The count in 1998 of 59,918 plunged to 28,074 nests by 2007. By 2012, the nest count was back up to 58,172.

## Tracking Turtle Tykes


There is wide agreement that Florida and federal protections have contributed significantly to the survival of sea turtles, especially green turtles, which were on the verge of disappearing from Florida in the 1970s.

This comes as countless Republicans heading toward the state GOP convention in Fort Worth later this week plan to carry long guns outside the Fort Worth Convention Center.

## Guns And Alcohol Don't Mix


Concealed handgun license holders and peace officers may carry their concealed handguns inside during the convention.

Long guns aren't allowed in places that sell alcohol. The business could lose its permit to sell drinks. People who take guns there could face trespassing charges.


And gun supporters are encouraging delegates, alternates and guests to carry black powder guns inside.

The Republican Party of Texas chairman issued a statement about weapons. He told members that "anyone carrying an openly exposed weapon will be asked to do so outside of the building."


Organizers have said around 150 people showed up at the event geared to promote the desire of Texans to openly carry their handguns. Donations were accepted; black powder revolvers and ammunition were among raffle prizes given out.

## State Of Open-Carry Confusion


"We must be willing and able to recognize what works and what doesn't, but we need your help to make these efforts a success."

NRA officials pointed out that they "love AR-15s and AKs as much as anybody."


Volunteers have said they are planning an open-carry walk outside the convention center at 6:30 p.m. Thursday.

Several restaurants asked that customers not bring long guns into their businesses.


While Uber and Lyft require users to be at least 18, that hasn't stopped some parents from letting their children use the services on a regular basis, creating a gray market for UberBLACK and other ride-hailing offerings, according to industry analysts and media reports.

## Riding Alone In Some Cars Is Against Rules


Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst and founder of Silicon Valley, California-based Crowd Companies, said that while there is clearly a market, limiting ride-hailing services to children may be too narrow to sustain a business model in an as-yet-unprofitable industry.

Shuddle boss Nick Allen said demand is already building for back-to-school.


But Allen is confident, saying feedback from early adopters has been positive, with many using it to navigate the logistical demands of back-to-school. He said ride-hailing for children is a "very big niche" that isn't served by other solutions.

Allen disagrees. He said offering rides for kids can be a big business. Parents and kids are busier than ever, he said.

The idea for the artwork was born of a violent campus protest on May 5, 1970, one day after Ohio National Guardsmen killed four students and wounded nine others protesting the war at Kent State University. The killings set off demonstrations across the country.

So the mural remained behind the wall. Its absence from view left generations of students unaware of a slice of UCLA history. The school experienced the activism of the Vietnam War era and, in particular, the nation's civil rights struggle.


The Times described the UCLA protest as "a window smashing march through the Westwood campus." It prompted university officials to declare the first state of emergency in the school's history. More than 70 were arrested, and a dozen students and 10 police officers were injured in clashes.

The idea for the artwork was born of a violent campus protest on May 5, 1970, in Ohio. The day before, students were protesting the Vietnam War at a university there. Soldiers from the National Guard tried to stop the demonstrations. They shot several students who were there.

Putin has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting that Russia has a right to protect its interests and those of Russian-speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine.

## Without A Shot


When the situation became critical in March, it was hardly news to those who work in and around the military. Ihor Teniukh, once the chief commander of the Ukrainian navy and in February and March the ill-fated minister of defense who held the spot when Russia occupied and then annexed Crimea without serious resistance, had tried to raise the alarm last year, writing that a plan for a "large-scale downsizing of the military" was dangerous.

## One Drone, No Pilot


Live television coverage in Russia and video from nine cameras streaming over Ukrainian opposition media showed fiery explosions illuminating the grimy tent city in Kiev's Independence Square after protesters ignored a warning to clear out and police in riot gear stormed the area about 8 p.m. Officers set fire to tents and lobbed tear-gas canisters into the crowds of defiant protesters.

Ukraine was once part of the Soviet Union, a union of republics led by Russia. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke apart into several countries and Ukraine got its independence. Since then, Ukraine has remained closely linked to Russia.


Authorities reported that unrest also had broken out elsewhere in western Ukraine, with protesters attacking local government offices in a number of areas.

## An Eerie Orange Glow


"Today we were able to see that only the government is interested in peaceful resolution of the situation," Prosecutor General Viktor Pshonka told state-controlled television. "Opposition leaders should take the responsibility for everything happening in the street of Kiev today. It is the opposition who announced a peaceful rally that turned into (a) violent standoff."

## Holding Their Ground


The surge in violence followed a short-lived amnesty agreement fulfilled over the weekend when authorities released the last 234 detained protesters and promised to drop criminal charges against them. In exchange, the opposition vacated Kiev City Hall and removed some barricades blocking streets around the Supreme Council, the national parliament.

Protest leaders remained defiant. Opposition leader Arseny Yatsenyuk appealed to Yanukovich to "spare Ukraine from becoming a country covered with blood." He called on the president to pull back police and stick to a cease-fire.


She patted a gray cat sitting on a shelf below a half-empty counter and started to pack up.

"We are dealing not with an army" but with several armed Russians who are paid to fight, said the officer, who gave his name only as Sergei.


Only U.S. military aid to Ukraine's besieged government holds the potential to give Putin any pause. As Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko told Congress recently with regard to U.S. non-military aid, "Blankets and night-vision goggles are important. But one cannot win a war with blankets."

Putin won't be stopped by the weak actions of the U.S. and Western Europe. So far, they've only put in place weak trade blocks to prevent countries and businesses from buying and selling with Russia. Threatening somewhat tougher trade blocks won't do anything.

The story began in the Honduran countryside. As subsistence farmers and small-time shopkeepers, her parents lacked the money to send their children to school. So the couple left their six children, ages 2 to 14, with family and paid $3,000 to be led across the Mexican border in 1994.

Anyone who wants to come to the United States needs permission from the U.S. government to stay. Undocumented immigrants came to the United States without proper permission.


"They couldn't find him, but they took my uncle and my two brothers-in-law," Navarro said. All three were put into deportation proceedings. "That's when my parents told us we couldn't tell anybody we were undocumented, because we would get in trouble."

In 1998, Hurricane Mitch hit Honduras, leaving millions of people homeless. For Turcios and her husband, a machine operator, it was a chance to stay in the United States legally. The U.S. let immigrants stay temporarily during disasters like that.


For about eight years after that, Navarro lived in fear. The uncle was deported. Her brothers-in-law had children here. One brother-in-law stayed in violation of the deportation order. The other left and re-entered the country illegally.

"Returning seemed impossible," Turcios said, and in 2002, she and her husband decided to send for their children.


Turcios' eight grandchildren, all U.S. citizens, are painfully aware of the situation.

For Natives, a mistrust of the legal system goes back generations, from soldiers forcibly relocating tribes in the 19th century to lawyers now being thought of only as someone who will put them in jail. The death of John T. Williams, a First Nations wood carver who was fatally shot by a Seattle police officer three years ago, furthered that mistrust.

The legal clinic was one of the first in the nation, Echo-Hawk said. It pays for itself and has continued without much involvement from other groups.


"They may not put faith in the legal system, but they may put faith in you," Cecil said.

"There's no other place like this in Indian Country," Dunlap said.


The legal clinic was one of the first in the nation, Echo-Hawk said. The clinic is self-sustaining and has been able to continue without as much involvement from other organizations.

As Dunlap and Lefferson spoke, a man with a beaded necklace and long gray hair walked in. Dunlap asked him how he slept the night before.


Dunlap said the Chief Seattle Club and the clinic are an example for the rest of Indian Country to follow.

He said he slept good, but his back hurt. His bed had been a concrete sidewalk.

In Colombia, however, danger is part of the show. While many riders wear helmets and face masks, others rush in with nothing but a straw hat. Some of the cattle wranglers go barefoot.

## Bulldozer For Ambulance


Coleo rules differ from country to country, but in Colombia it works like this: If a rider can roll a bull once, a campana, he gets 20 points; if the bull rolls twice, or a campanilla, it's 30 points. To roll a bull three times, or a remolino, is as rare as a grand slam, and is worth 40 points.

## Losing His Eyes, Keeping His Dream


Pete Carroll, then coach of the Trojans, heard about Olson and invited him, his twin sister, Emma, and their parents, Cindy and Brian, to meet the team.

Still, late in 2012 Olson went to see Orange Lutheran Coach Chuck Petersen. He asked Coach Petersen if he could join the team. Petersen told him to return after the team finished the season.


"We wanted to make him a part of it as much as possible," O'Dowd said.

"You're going to have to earn your spot," Petersen said.


Olson visited Carroll several times in Seattle and at the last two Super Bowls.

The snap and the kick were both perfect and Orange Lutheran tied the score.


When he broached the idea of becoming a long snapper, the only position that does not require a player to visually track the ball or the movements of opponents, his mother feared he might be rebuffed. Or injured.

Olson is not expecting special treatment.


"I wasn't sure that was a good idea," she said.

Fortunately for bargain hunters, there are also plenty of consumers who want the latest and greatest technology, requiring them to get rid of a still-valuable model from a year or two ago. Because the value of the items may range from $50 to $200 or more, they aren't sitting forgotten in a drawer anymore.

"We're farmers and we'll continue to farm," Caroline said. "It's our life."

Under board member questioning, Orton said his department didn't properly tell parents about a new electronic payment system, and he promised efforts to prevent meals from being tossed again. He said the investigation was ongoing and his report wasn't definitive.

District Superintendent McKell Withers said they were told not to come to work because they might be in danger. Indeed, several threatening phone calls have been made to the school. Police, however, have decided there is no real danger.


But he said the department "did fail in getting information out effectively."

"We share your real horror," she said.


Some parents weren't assuaged by the report, saying it was still unclear what the payment system's problems were and who was responsible for taking away the lunches.

## Changes Promised


Many now revel in the new freedoms offered by faster highway speeds.

"We really don't think we're changing the speed that most people drive," Gleason said. "We're changing the legal limit to reflect speeds they're already doing."


"The 80 mph speed limit is an antidote to those high airline ticket prices and nickel-and-dime onboard fees. The 80 mph speed limit is symbolic of my individuality and freedom," wrote editorial page editor Robert Ehlert in the Idaho Statesman. "This is the West. This is the way we roll."

Safety experts advise against raising speed limits on roads that are shared by cars, walkers, bikes, and buses. New York City, for example, recently lowered speed limits from 30 to 25 mph to protect walkers.


On a recent weekday outside Leeds, Sergeant Jake Hicks sat in his 2014 white Dodge Charger, watching his radar machine blip as it captured the speeds of motorists descending Black Ridge mountain and its 2,000-foot elevation drop.

At a gas station outside Leeds, truck driver Jake Hansen stopped for a break and some coffee. He was not in a rush, thanks to the higher speed limit.


In the past, he's clocked motorists topping 100 mph on this stretch of road that winds along softly banked curves though red rock and desert scrub. The high limit has not changed his job much. But he says many highway patrol officers here have lessened the cushion they will allow motorists to exceed the new 80 mph limit.

"It does make a difference — I can get ahead of schedule," Hansen, age 26, said. "You get there faster. You unload faster."


There were no children present Thursday morning at the outdoor, desertlike facility, where marksmen fire toward a large dirt berm. Blake Carrington took aim at a paper target with the black and blue silhouette of a person. Brass bullet casings bounced back behind him. Above him was a sign: "Safety is no accident."

The range where Jensen works does not allow full automatic fire. A firearm on full automatic fire shoots bullets in a steady stream while the trigger is pressed. The Uzi the girl was shooting was on full automatic fire at the time of the accident.


Carrington said he was torn about whether gun access laws should be stricter for children. "That's the thing about guns," he said. "They will do exactly what the human tells them to do. Poor decision making is what gets us."

There were no children Thursday morning at the outdoor range, where people fired toward a large ridge of dirt. Blake Carrington took aim at a paper target. Above him was a sign. It read: "Safety is no accident."


Children have to be 10 or older and be under the supervision of a parent to shoot at the indoor range, Yeandle said.

Tom said he shoots for sport and to exercise his Second Amendment rights. The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to have guns. "I don't think you should keep kids away from firearms," he said. "This shouldn't keep people from taking their kids to the range."


Although the last four years of little rain have played a role in this agricultural quandary, farmers also point to the immediate effects of two successive exceedingly warm winters, which have gone largely unnoticed in the ongoing conversation about the California drought. For shoppers, it means less salad and more dessert.

Fruit has been ripening and ready to pick at surprisingly early dates. At the same time, some vegetables have been in very short supply. This has caused prices to be higher than usual. Farmers are selling their lettuces for twice what they were at this time last year. The price of cauliflower has doubled just since February.


The higher temperatures have interrupted the tightly orchestrated schedule of planting and harvesting that farmers rely on to ensure a smooth supply of produce throughout the year. Farmers plan their calendars with an almost military precision so that the harvest will move smoothly from one field to the next, one crop becoming ready to pick just as the last is finishing up. Warm weather pushes some fields to be ready to harvest much earlier, leaving a gap until the next set of fields is ready.

## Temperatures Rise, Crops Speed Up


After two successive warm winters, Alex Weiser vows he'll be ready to avoid the spring gap next time around — though, of course, there's no guarantee that the streak of warm winters will continue.

Brian Antle is a produce grower at Tanimura & Antle in Salinas. He says it became clear early this winter that some vegetables would ripen two to three weeks early. It may be hard to find some vegetables in grocery stores now because those crops ripened early.


The effects of the warm weather certainly aren't limited to small farmers, as Brian Antle can attest. The third-generation grower at Salinas-based produce giant Tanimura &amp; Antle, which farms 38,000 acres, says it became obvious early this winter that the warm weather would mess with his plans when crops such as lettuce, celery, broccoli and cauliflower were maturing two to three weeks ahead of schedule.

"As soon as we put our best-laid plans on paper, Mother Nature comes along," said Mark McBride. He is with Coastline Family Farms based in the Salinas Valley. All winter the farm has been 10 to 21 days ahead of schedule. For the next few weeks, McBride will have much less to sell until other crops finish growing.


Siso's comments were typical of the exasperation many Venezuelans' expressed after President Nicolas Maduro's state of the nation address last week, in which he defended the socialist model of government but offered no immediate solutions for the country's deepening economic crisis.

## President Didn't Say Much


The lines are not only growing longer but more violent, a sign of rising frustration, Siso said. She avoids shopping in the Valles del Tuy barrio where she lives because the "law of the jungle" is what prevails there. "Those who push, shove and punch take everything and leave nothing for the rest of us."

Maduro defended the socialist system in his speech. He said it is fair because it spreads money around so everyone gets some. Maduro blames the United States for his country's economic problems. He claims the United States is producing more oil to make Venezuela's oil worth less and hurt the government.


Among the few defenders of the government encountered in Thursday's lines was Jose Delgado, a 42-year-old shopping center janitor, who blamed scarcities on hoarding wholesalers. Delgado is among the still considerable supporters of the late Hugo Chavez. He insisted that tougher times have not turned them against Maduro, Chavez's successor.

A construction worker named Ramon Diaz was standing in line at a supermarket in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. He said that many items such as milk never get to the government stores where they are sold at fixed prices. Instead, thieves steal them before they get to stores. Then they sell them on the black market at three times the government price.


"Venezuelan gasoline has a price that doesn't cover anything. It's a distortion," Maduro said. He also announced a 15 percent increase in the minimum wage, effective next month, and an increase in scholarships for high school and college students.

Carlos Frias was not thinking about that as he stood in line at a drug store. He said he spends every day standing in line for milk and diapers. The country is broke and Venezuelans have to deal with it, he said.

That may seem like a stretch to compare Angels Vet, located in Savannah in northern Missouri, to the famed children's research hospital. But don't tell that to Silverglat, who first opened the clinic to serve M'Shoogy's Emergency Animal Rescue, a nonprofit he founded 30 years ago in Savannah.

About 13 years ago, Silverglat began Angels Vet Expresscare. It gives medical care to animals. Now Angels Vet cares for 100,000 animals each year. Pet owners pay much less than at regular vet centers.


"The secret is volume, but the clinic was founded on the premise that no animal should fail to receive care services because the expense is too high," Silverglat said. "I guess we're like the St. Jude's of veterinary clinics by teaching and sharing our model."

## No One Turned Away If They Can't Pay


But it wasn't until President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander of all Allied forces in World War II, that it became Veterans Day in 1954. Veterans Day was designed to remember all those who served in the military while Memorial Day, at the end of May, commemorates those who died while serving.

The holiday began as Armistice Day on Nov. 11, 1919. It was meant to remember the end of World War I. Congress created an annual observance in 1926. Nov. 11 became a national holiday in 1939.


The military increasingly has become a career so it is not uncommon for soldiers to have served in more than one conflict. More than 54,000 are still alive after serving during the Vietnam era and both Gulf wars. That is statistically the same as the about 50,000 who served in three wars, World War II, the Korean War and during the Vietnam era, according to the Census Bureau.

Veterans are still alive from many wars. According to the government, there are 7.4 million Vietnam-era veterans. About 5.4 million veterans served during the Gulf wars. About 1.6 million served in World War II and 2.3 million served in Korea. About 5.3 million veterans served only in peacetime.


"These kids are poor. Financial (capital), they don't have. Social capital? It's the gang leaders, the playboys of the neighborhood. The capital they actually have is reputation," Bocanegra said. "Reputation means a lot for these kids. And what that reputation means is, 'I have to maintain an image.' Because at the end of the day, it's about protecting yourself."

"They always said they had to be on point or aware or careful," said veteran Richard Rivera. "We told them we can relate a lot — except you guys are fighting for a street corner, and we are fighting for a country."


"How many of these stories were hidden in the attic and never saw the light of day? Look what was covered up," said Grant.

Another counterintuitive take on video game violence came from University of Buffalo communications professor Matthew Grizzard, who had research subjects play a first-person shooter game as either a United Nations soldier or a terrorist.

Gaming has often been linked to being overweight. Professor Chennan Liu found the opposite. People who play video games for three to six hours a day were thinner than those who played less, she found.


It was his idea to launch the program to attract a diverse assortment of students to the school. The national attention — the program has been featured by ESPN, NPR, HBO's "Real Sports" and a variety of other outlets — has been a "nice byproduct," Melcher said.

## "League Of Legends"


"Sorry, gamers," the letter read. "If you are looking for a scholarship to play 'League of Legends,' you've come to the wrong Robert Morris University."

It was Melcher's idea to offer scholarships to gamers. These scholarships have gotten Robert Morris a lot of national attention. The eSports scholarships have been discussed by several news sources including ESPN, NPR and HBO's "Real Sports."


David Weerts, an associate professor of higher education at the University of Minnesota, said that gaming technology can be useful for teaching some skills. But he said he was wary of "this kind of robotized new system." The risk, he said, is jumping into such a program without "proof of concept that people are gaining something from this."

Depending on the answers, the game grades their performance and gives feedback, said Timothy Loatman. He runs technology education services for Rasmussen.


Nancy Black, an anthropology professor at Metro State University, was even more dubious. "It seems quite superficial," said Black, who is president of a faculty union at the Minnesota state universities. "Where is the teaching in this?" She also questioned how a computer game could evaluate a student's judgment skills, especially "with no faculty whatsoever."

"Mastering the game is certainly a way to prove and hone the skills," he said.


"I love that ... they're trying to be authentic by drinking out of canteens and tin cups," said Alice Best. "And they have their bats in a barrel, or on an old wooden rack. It's really, really nice."

"We try to do everything we can as close as possible to the period," Alberts said. "Because if we're not doing that, we might as well just be playing softball in the park."


Not all teams are such sticklers for authenticity, said Dennis "Pops" Wiegmann, president of the National Vintage Base Ball Association. The organization has about 65 active clubs — some dating to the 1980s — and he estimated dozens of other teams are unaffiliated with the group.

"It gives people another way of looking at the game," Wiegmann said.

Allice Best said she "loved" that the players try to be historically accurate, drinking out of tin cups. "And they have their bats in a barrel, or on an old wooden rack," she said. "It's really, really nice."

"We're not trying to go into school and raise Cain or anything," Comer said. "We're doing it to raise a point that the flag is not racist. Everyone else can wear whatever shirts they want but we're not. We just said 'It's time to put a stop to it.'"

Drake said students have not been allowed to wear Confederate flag symbols since 2002. That year, there were many fights between black and white students broke out. Some of them were caused by students wearing the Confederate flag. She said the violence continues at the school today.


Comer said that he does not discriminate against anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or the color of their skin.

Drake said that freedom of speech is important to the district. She added that it has to make sure all students are safe.


Reedy, who said his ancestors fought for the Confederacy in the first Battle of Bull Run, said he doesn't believe the dress code policy is fair. "Most people look at me like I'm a racist. What I really find offensive is we have a black student awareness club but we don't have a Mexican awareness or Russian or white club."

Morley, who is black, said seeing the flag bothered him, but he never said anything around his white classmates. Morley said the flag made him think of slavery. His stepfather is a descendant of a slave. His father's family likely has slave roots as well.


Outside of film, Redwood City, California-based AltspaceVR is building software for meetings and conferences in virtual reality. In the AltspaceVR app, users appear as a Wall-E-like avatar. The app uses the head tracking capabilities of virtual reality headsets to determine where a person is looking and how his or her head is moving, and translates that into the avatar's movements. It also simulates being in an actual physical space with other people by allowing users to hear someone better if that person's avatar is closer. Getting really close to someone's avatar lets users whisper.

The VR maker Jaunt has created a new VR movie camera. It allows users to make their own VR movies.


It will be awhile before companies hold staff meetings via virtual reality avatars — if ever. Other workplace uses for VR are more immediate. Dan Ward, co-founder of mobile app development company Detroit Labs, said he believes the coming year will see various industries use VR for training — think combat simulation for the military; natural disaster drills for police, firefighters and paramedics; auto repair education; and so on.

## Still One Big Problem


"In the past, we've spent billions of dollars re-creating situations for people to train in," Ward said. "But these VR head units are able to trick the mind really well, and we all know that a lot of training is mental, so there's a massive opportunity here."

As for virtual reality and the movies, there is still one big problem. Not enough people own headsets, so it's difficult to get anyone to make VR movies.

The technique — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) — isn't a recent phenomenon. Discovered in 1983 by Nobel Prize winner and University of California, Berkeley, alum Kary Mullis, it's been used for identifying human remains, food safety, and bacterial detection.

## Copying DNA Strands ...


Working on Fast PCR since 2010, Beer's team was responsible for speeding up the amplification part to less than three minutes. In that technique, cold water is passed over a porous copper platform holding the microscopic samples, rapidly dropping the temperature to 55 degrees Celsius (131 degrees Fahrenheit). The platform is heated back up, the cycle repeats 30 times, and the results are matched to a known genetic signature. As speedy as the procedure is now, Wheeler thinks the team can go even faster.

## ... For Fast Diagnosis


The altered T-cells are injected into the patient's veins where it is hoped that they will multiply.

The treatment meant removing millions of Emma's T-cells. A T-cell is a type of white blood cell. The body needs T-cells for its immune system, which keeps the body from getting sick.


"We call the modified immune (T) cells, serial killer cells," June told Ross Kauffman, who directed the film about Emma's treatment. "Each infused cell can kill more than 1,000 different tumor cells," June explained.

After doctor's removed Emma's T-cells, they started to infect them. They treated them with a disabled form of HIV. HIV is a virus that causes AIDS, which is a deadly disease. For decades doctors have studied how to prevent HIV from infecting the body. Now, they are infecting people on purpose. But this is not the same dreaded virus.


The experimental procedure made Emma very ill. She was placed on a ventilator to help her breathe and her body temperature reached 105 degrees. Swollen and unconscious, Emma's family prepared for her death.

"The virus has been engineered so it can't cause disease anymore," Dr. Carl June said. Dr. June works at the University of Pennsylvania. Instead, the virus attacks cancer cells, he explained.


## Treatment Does Not Work For All

But Emma did not die.


However, six other adults and one other child who received the treatment still have leukemia.

"It was like the calm after the storm," June told Kauffman. "The clouds went away and she woke up and there was no leukemia."


BALTIMORE — In the month after Alexander Dominguez joined Maygon Thompson's third-grade class at Charles Carroll Barrister Elementary School, he breezed through worksheets and quickly rose to be among the most studious members.

BALTIMORE — Eye doctors in Baltimore are trying to help students read better.


Whether students can't read because they can't see, Collins said, is one of those "important research questions you think someone else has answered."

"I thought he was kidding," Thompson said. "But he's so serious about his work."


"It's the sort of age-old question we're trying to get an answer to," she said. "And if we can, I feel like we're doing something very real and very tangible that can change students' lives."

## "We Were Very Surprised"


"This rich book collection, consisting principally of Epicurean philosophical texts, is a unique cultural treasure, as it is the only ancient library to survive together with its books," the study authors wrote. "The texts preserved in these papyri, now mainly stored in the Officina dei Papiri in the National Library of Naples, had been unknown to scholars before the discovery of the Herculaneum library, since they had not been copied and recopied in late Antiquity, the Middle Ages and Renaissance."

The bundles are scrolls – that is, long sheets of papyrus paper. Scrolls were the books of the Romans' time.


This is where a technique like X-ray computed tomography, which could penetrate the rolled scrolls, would come in handy. The problem is, the ancient writers used ink made of carbon pulled from smoke residue. And because the papyrus had been carbonized from the blazing heat, both paper and ink are made of roughly the same stuff. Because the soot-based ink and baked paper have about the same density, until now it's been practically impossible to tell ink and paper apart.

For the first time, scientists were able to read words inside the scrolls, without unrolling them. They used a special kind of X-ray to see inside the charred papers.


"Today James Crow wears a suit and tie and is much more sophisticated," Collins told the family.

"Our dealers don't manufacture Volkswagens, they sell them," said Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, which represents 50 VW dealers across the state. "They have worked hard to build their brand and customer loyalty but have been harmed by the dishonesty of their own business partner, VW."

The dealers do not work for Volkswagen. No one can take them to court for the company's actions. Yet they still find themselves caught in the middle. The product they sell is in trouble and their customers are angry.


The result has been a total freeze on all new and some used VW diesel-engine cars. The Environmental Protection Agency has refused to certify the 2016 line of Volkswagen diesels, and the company has issued a stop-sell order to its dealers, preventing them from selling new diesel cars and certified used ones.

Dealers do not make Volkswagens, they sell them, said Brian Maas. He is the president of a group that represents 50 VW dealers across California. Maas said the dealers were trusted by their customers. Now their own business partner, VW, has hurt them by being dishonest.

"Listen to that roar," he said. "I love Chicago and Chicago definitely loves me."


The 35-year-old married father of three said he has the strength to hang there for up to 20 minutes while waiting to be rescued. His crew can reach him in about 90 seconds anywhere on the cable.

After successfully completing the first walk, Wallenda took an elevator down to the street, and returned to the first skyscraper for a second walk, this one blindfolded.


Wallenda changed his game plan a bit after weather-related delays during the high-wire's installation.

By crossing between two buildings blindfolded and more than 500 feet above the ground, Wallenda set another world record, for highest blindfolded walk ever.


Rich Ross said he wasn't worried about a fall and hadn't planned what he would do to cover his son's eyes.

Jake Ross said he was looking forward to seeing Wallenda walk blindfolded. Jake has practiced tightrope walking himself, even though he says he is afraid of heights.


Other remote communities at the edge of the Bering Sea also are seeing a steep decline in walrus harvested the past several years. Walrus, described by some as having a taste between veal and beef, is highly prized by Alaska Natives as a subsistence food to store for winter, with the adult male animals averaging 2,700 pounds. The sale of carved ivory from the tusks, legal only for Alaska Natives, also brings in supplemental income to communities with high unemployment rates.

In 1991, when his father, President George H.W. Bush, attacked Iraq over its occupation of Kuwait, he was urged by some in Congress to expand the operation to attack the capital city, Baghdad, and remove Saddam Hussein from power.

President George W. Bush ordered the invasion of Iraq in 2003, but it seems he gave little thought to what might replace the government of its leader Saddam Hussein.


What was not difficult to see in Iraq was the likelihood that any new government in Iraq would be dominated by the majority Shiite community, and that it might redress its grievances in a way that would leave the country in turmoil.

Wisely, he knew that such action would create many more problems. Under Saddam Hussein, the Sunni community held the power. Sunnis are a minority within Iraq who follow one kind of Islam. The majority Shiite community practices a somewhat different type of Islam, and they were resentful over their treatment at the hands of Saddam Hussein.


In both instances, our initiation of military operations — Afghanistan in 2001, Iraq in 2003 — could have been avoided. In Afghanistan, our demand on the Taliban — that it turn over Osama bin Laden and his associates — was not pursued. The Taliban was beginning to respond to our demand, but instead we invaded.

In Afghanistan, we removed the Taliban, a government that ruled under a extremely strict form of Islam. Afghanistan is home to a variety of ethnic groups. It has no history of a government with control over the entire country. Before the Taliban, different warlords controlled areas of the country.


But major savings — measured in billions rather than millions of dollars — can be made only by cutting an entire fleet, the Air Force has said. That way, the infrastructure that supports the fleet can also be cut, which encompasses thousands of jobs.

No one questions the A-10's success. The plane is considered one of the best at directly protecting troops on the ground. Pilots do that with its powerful Gatling gun.


But the plane is designed to keep flying even if parts of the wing or one of its engines has been blown to shreds. And the cockpit is surrounded by a bullet-resistant titanium tub. The aircraft has been routinely upgraded over the years.

The A-10 can't fight other planes in the sky. It's not quiet, and it's not really fast.

## Whale Watches The Test Run


March has been building and testing amphibious cars, or amphibians, for years. He filed patents for his first amphibian in 2003. Six years later, he set the Guinness World Record for fastest amphibious car with the Python, which has a 450-horsepower Corvette engine and can hit 60 mph on the water.

The car that March is test-driving to Catalina is called the Panther. It cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars to build.


Back in Newport Harbor, March points his Panther toward the horizon. He's surrounded by three powerboats, which are carrying friends, family and a case of champagne, which March's wife hesitates to put on ice, for fear she might jinx the crossing.

## Drilling New Wells


Near the Oregon border in Shasta County, the city of Montague — with a population of about 1,400 — is one of the list's success stories. It had long used an irrigation ditch that transported water from a lake 25 miles away. But the ditch ran dry and, in April, Montague landed on the critical list.

"If this drought keeps on going, some larger, more sophisticated communities are going to be in trouble next year," Quinn said.


Working with state and federal agencies, Montague built a pipeline that pumped water from wells near Lake Shastina into the Shasta River and then into residents' homes, said Chris Tyhurst, Montague's water supervisor.

## A Resort Faded And Brown


But sustaining the viability of farms is also an issue. Runsten cited a CAFF study that found that the 250-acre Frog's Leap vineyard in California's Napa Valley conserved roughly 64,000 gallons of water per acre through dry farming each year.

A recent study warned that water from  the large source of underground water farmers use for irrigation was being used up too fast. This was happening even when wet years followed dry ones. Such a source of underground water is called an aquifer.

## "A University Is A Small City"


The benefit of the program is that it allows campus departments to have weapons that have already been widely used by law enforcement agencies, Kennesaw State University (KSU) Police Chief Roger Stearns said. For years, the "bad guys" had been better armed than police, he said.

John Lester, a spokesman for Columbus State University, said the shooting made his school's police department feel it needed to be more heavily armed. School police received three M-16 guns through the program. "Fortunately," Lester said, "we have never had to use them."


Five to 7 inches fell overnight in the Chicago area, while 8 to 10 inches was expected to fall in central Illinois, Indiana and Michigan later Sunday, National Weather Service meteorologist Ed Fenelon said. Forecasts also called for several inches in western Tennessee and 1 to 3 inches in Kentucky.

Michigan residents had also jammed stores to stock up on supplies.

In St. Louis, grocery stores sold out of the essentials before Sunday's bad weather.

Sanford, colleague Jackie Sones and other researchers at the Bodega lab, along with scientists at Point Blue Conservation Science, a nonprofit group in Petaluma, have documented more than 100 common dolphins off the Farallon Islands in the past two months. They're normally seen hundreds of miles away, off Southern California.

"It's a mystery," he said.


The scientists have scooped up a tiny species of ocean snail called the tropical sea butterfly, normally found far to the south. They have documented a Guadalupe fur seal, normally found off Baja California in Mexico; blue buoy barnacles and purple-striped jellyfish, which usually drift off Southern California; and a Guadalupe murrelet, a tiny seabird that frequents Mexico.

## Tropical Fish Go North


In August and September there were even sightings of skipjack tuna and giant sunfish, or mola mola, off Alaska.

The scientists have found tiny sea butterflies, a type of tropical snail. They're normally found far to the south. They also found a Guadalupe fur seal, which is normally found in the waters off Mexico.


In many parts of California, the commercial salmon catch was down, and squid were caught as far north as Eureka, which is unusual.

## No Cold Barrier


Many other experts agree. Wildland crews are equipped for work on wide-open swaths of federal land, stopping fires before they reach population centers. Unlike municipal firefighters, they aren't generally trained to put out burning structures. But as more people move into the WUI, the responsibility of these wildland firefighters has blurred.

Burton doesn't mince words about communities next door to the wilderness. When wildfires threaten homes but not lives, he says a firefighting crew's best choice is simple: "Just let it burn."

That geologic upheaval in an area known as the cradle of humankind is believed to be responsible for the gradual conversion of dense, humid forests into more sparsely treed grasslands that made upright locomotion on two feet advantageous to evolving human ancestors.

## Whale Speaks To Us


Finally, just before another trip to Kenya in 2011, a collections official at Harvard located the fossil, sheathed in the protective jacket, Jacobs said.

The whale fossil was found in 1964. Jacobs first read about the find in a 1975 research paper, and started searching for it in 1980.


Researchers often study tissue and even whale blow — the stuff they exhale from their blowholes — for chemical clues. But for the most part, blubber, or fat tissue, reveals just the whales' total accumulation, said Gina Ylitalo, a Seattle-based research chemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who was not involved in the study. It doesn't really give scientists a play-by-play account of the animal's chemical exposure or hormonal production over time.

"It's naturally pretty heavy and strong and resilient," Usenko said of the wax, which is mostly made up of keratin (the stuff in hair and nails) and lipids. "It doesn't necessarily smell great. … When we were pulling it out, some of the crew actually just left."

## Testosterone And Cortisol


The average concentrations of cortisol also doubled over the animal's lifetime, which could be due to any number of factors, including food availability, changes in social status, contaminant exposure or environmental noise, the authors wrote.

The whale's testosterone levels jumped a bunch when it was around 10 years old. Researchers used the information to change estimates of when a male becomes a biological adult.


In fact, a full 96 percent of the total burden of organic pollutants in its wax came from four historic-use pesticides (and their metabolites) and a PCB, a type of chemical used in coolants and insulating fluids.

## A Track Record Of Ocean Pollutants


Fearing for their safety, the crew turned back.

The WET team clipped a satellite tag to the gear already wrapped around the whale. Now, wherever the humpback went, they could find it.


After swimming some 700 miles entwined in rope, the whale was free.

Meanwhile, the whale swam south. The line that clenched its tail became a burden. As the winds continued to blow, the humpback zigged and zagged. On May 1, it strayed too far offshore to mount a rescue.


Folkens, the marine mammal expert, said a poet wouldn't be able to describe the rush of emotions he felt when the final bits of line were snipped.

Seven days later, rescuers drove south to Point Arguello. The high seas prevented them from launching a rescue.


So far in 2015, at least 25 entanglements have been reported off the coast of California.

## Rules Have Helped Protect Huge Mammals


Renzullo is not so sure. "About 90 percent of the crabs harvested are caught within six weeks of the season opening — then the catch drops off exponentially," she said. "My guess is that the number of whale entanglements will drop off too as the year goes on."

More fishing and more whales in the area are leading to more whales getting trapped, she said.

## "It Lifts My Spirit"


As might be expected, such serious disabilities can be devastating. What once was natural, like buttoning a shirt, is now a chore, or impossible. For some, depression can take a toll, and finding an escape from their suddenly sedentary lifestyles can be a challenge.

"It lifts my spirit," said Gay, who recently finished college. Most of his teammates agreed.


"It lifts my spirit and makes me feel normal," said Gay, 27, a recent Kent State grad from Streetsboro, Ohio. It was a comment that was repeated by most of his teammates.

Zuravel, a college student, said he quickly realized he was wrong.


Able-bodied men and women are also needed to play with the team during practices, added Thallas, 32, a network engineer from Parma Heights, Ohio.

"We can walk everywhere; they can't," said Haas. "It's so awesome to see people with disabilities play at a competitive level." Playing the game is something they can do on their own, without help.

"You dream of the opportunity, and being able to put in the work every day to make it happen is a tribute to our partnership," White said.

## Thousand And One Arabian Nights


Davis and White won both the short and free dances with season bests, their total score of 195.52 beating Virtue and Moir by 4.53 points.

Virtue and Moir have said this will be their last season as competitors. Meanwhile, Davis and White have made no decision. Both U.S. skaters have occasionally studied at the University of Michigan.


"No athlete likes to sit in this position," Moir said, referring to second place, "but it is easier when you know how hard these guys worked."

## The Russians Are Coming


The next great dance team clearly is going to be Russians Elena Ilinykh and Nikita Katasalapov, who took third with the most compelling free dance of the night. Their interpretation of "Swan Lake," full of poses and movements that turned the arena into the Bolshoi Theater, was utterly balletic and seamless.

The intense "Scheherazade" music was perfectly suited for Davis and White's power and athleticism. The most striking feature of the way they performed it was a feeling for the beat. Their skating changes of pace matched the shifts in the music's speed. That is an understanding White said they had not developed until three years ago.


Virtue and Moir's free dance music was an unfortunate mash-up of Russian classical pieces cut and pasted into something that would have confounded even Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. No matter that they skated exceptionally well Monday, no matter that they were supposed to be interpreting the turbulence of life, a sense of fragmentation prevailed.

Davis and White skated last. Two Russian couples had gone immediately before them, sending the crowd into its usual fit of nationalistic pride.


He went on to say while in childhood, his family boiled down vegetables until they would get "all soft and mushy, and nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they tasted horrible because they were all mush. And now I actually like vegetables, because they're prepared right."

## The President Shows Up


Michelle Obama put the event on the White House calendar as part of her Let's Move initiative to fight childhood [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). After she invited the kids to eat with their fingers, the president quipped: "Michelle never said to me I can just pick up something with my fingers at a state dinner. So that's not fair."

Although President Barack Obama was not invited to come to the event, he made a surprise visit. "Usually at a state dinner, I get invited," he joked.


The northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) is a subspecies of white rhinoceros that once ranged across parts of Uganda, Sudan, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo and into Chad and Cameroon. They're among the largest land animals on Earth, second only to elephants. They can run at speeds of more than 30 miles per hour and their horns, tough skin and sheer size mean they have no natural predators.

## No Northern White Rhinos Left In Wild


Civil war, habitat loss and poaching for their valuable horns decimated the rare breed; between 1960 and 2015 the population fell from 2,000 to five.

No northern white rhinos have lived in the wild since 2008.


North America's tallest bird, with a population of about 600, has lost three adults to gunfire in recent months, "senselessly" undercutting plans to breed a thriving population of the radiant white whooping crane, wildlife authorities say.

The tallest bird in North America is the whooping crane. But its numbers are small, with [only about 600 left alive](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Their population shrank further after three adults were shot in recent months. Wildlife officials say this hurts plans to help breed more of the beautiful white bird.


On Friday, two cranes were found shot in southwestern Louisiana, state officials said. The 3-year-old female crane died. A 4-year-old male, who according to X-rays suffered two bone fractures on a wing, was scheduled to have surgery Sunday morning at Louisiana State University.

## One Recovers From Shooting


In one case, a juvenile who admitted shooting a whooping crane was charged in Indiana state court with a misdemeanor and eventually fined $1, a punishment that rankled animal rights groups.

A year ago, a 26-year-old South Dakota man pleaded guilty to killing a whooping crane. He was sentenced and charged an $85,000 fine.


On a recent weekday, however, John Keane, a U.S. Forest Service research wildlife ecologist, found a reason for cautious optimism at an expanse of lush meadowlands about 10 miles west of Yosemite where he has studied great gray owls for 15 years.

Roy Bridgman is a wildlife biologist for the Stanislaus National Forest. He said he "visited a great owl nest that had been around for 20 years and it was collapsed. For a species with a tiny population, any loss at all is a big hit."


Local populations of bears, deer and other relatively common animals are expected to recover. But prospects for the black-backed woodpecker, a candidate for listing under the California Endangered Species Act, remain uncertain.

That bear was put down by California wildlife officials. So was an injured cub. Three other adult bears were found dead nearby, Mcleod said.


He said all of the firefighters had deployed their fire shelters — an emergency measure when there is no escape.

Officials lost radio contact with the crew at 4:30 p.m., said Steve Skurja, a sheriff's spokesman. A helicopter crew spotted the bodies, he said.


Roxie Glover, a spokeswoman for Wickenburg Community Hospital, said officials had told her to expect injured firefighters. Then the grim news arrived.

Skurja said that 19 members of the 20-person crew had died. One survivor was hospitalized.


"It became clear that the firefighters had been deceased," Glover said. "We were told that we were not getting firefighters."

"The fire was very aggressive. It just overtook them," Skurja said.


"I think pretty much every salt mine in the country is out now, or very nearly," said Harold Mayo, general manager of the Hutchinson Salt Mine in Kansas, where much of the Midwest's salt is mined. "It's just a very unusual winter as far as demand."

"If we don't have more ice storms we'll be fine," County Commissioner Brent Hampy said. The wind whipped his cheeks in the 11-degree chill. "But if we have two more ice storms, we're going to be out."


The mine is producing its capacity of 3,300 tons of salt a day, but is still turning away people who call trying to buy salt, instead giving priority to places that have a contract. To others, they can offer only a different type of salt not usually used for melting ice on roads.

## "We're Totally Out"


"We have seen a large demand for ice melt," said Tara Gudger, a Lowe's spokeswoman. "As the end of the winter weather season nears, we're continually working with suppliers to replenish store shelves."

"I think pretty much every salt mine in the country is out now, or very nearly," said Harold Mayo, general manager of the Hutchinson Salt Mine in Kansas. Much of the Midwest's salt is mined at Hutchinson. "It's just a very unusual winter as far as demand."


"We would hope that as it gets warmer we'd have the salt, but at this point we don't have any particular expectations," Pajor said.

"We have seen a large demand for ice melt," said Tara Gudger, a Lowe's spokeswoman. The company keeps working with suppliers to get more salt, she said.


Pennsylvania's Department of Transportation is trying out Beet Heet in Butler County, a product made from processed sugar beet molasses. Indiana, Ohio and Tennessee are using the same or similar products.

## Using Syrup, Juice And Brine


"We have enough in the state, but just not in the right places," said Michael Sproul, an engineer with Wisconsin's winter maintenance program. Storm after storm this winter has eaten up 60 percent more salt than the average expended during the last five winters, he said.

"We can cut your salt usage by a third, saving people some money in the long run," said Mike Demaray. He is the sales manager for Beet 55, one of the mixing options. The sticky stuff turns the snow a brownish color.


In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, after declaring a state of emergency, directed the state Department of Transportation to move 130 truckloads of surplus salt to communities that need it. To expedite salt deliveries, the department waived federal restrictions on hours for salt truck drivers to allow them to work as long as needed until the emergency is over. The MTA also waived weight restrictions on bridges to allow larger loads of salt to move through.

"With the real globalization of the world, the growing importance of Asia, not only in sports but also in all areas of life, I think it is more or less normal that we have more Olympic Games taking place in Asia," Bach said.

Massimov said Kazakhstan hosting the Winter Games would be "a golden opportunity."


The issue of public safety loomed large, with much discussion of the kid cages, boxy structures that resemble chicken coops. Photos and video of the cages have been circulated by Americans for Prosperity, although it was unclear how many exist or who requested or paid for them. Local media reports suggest at least some of them were built by students in a high school shop class.

Down the hall, the anti-wolf event was sponsored by Americans for Prosperity. The group gets money from the conservative Koch brothers. The group screened the movie "Wolves in Government Clothing." The film said rampaging wolves were like an out-of-control federal government.


"All we can go on is what has happened in the past," said Carroll, a conservation biologist with the Klamath Center for Conservation Research in Northern California. "There have been maybe two to three attacks in the last decade, in Canada and Alaska, where there are thousands of wolves."

Crigler, the Arizona rancher, who also attended the event, said she understands the fears of the guests in her tourist cabins. "I can't tell them that they are perfectly safe. There is some degree of risk," she said, adding that she worries that the wolves are becoming too used to people. "They are meat eaters. Savages."


Wolf advocate Michael Robinson with the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity said he respected people's fears but added, "The risk has been greatly exaggerated for cynical reasons."

Carlos Carroll says the chances of wolves targeting people is low. He is one of the scientists studying Mexican wolves for the Fish and Wildlife Service.


Lifelong Ironwood resident Al Clemens said the wolves have "decimated" the local deer population, affecting the popular — and economically important — local deer hunt. In recent years, hunters at his deer camp south of town have seen only about one-sixth of the deer they used to see, he said.

Wolves were all but [extinct](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) in much of the U.S. by the 1930s. Michigan lost almost all of their wolves by the end of the 1950s.


No other apex predator, a hunting animal at the top of the food chain, elicits the fearful emotional reaction wolves do. There are no fairy tales featuring the Big Bad Black Bear threatening a small girl. There is no cautionary tale about the Boy Who Cried Cougar. Horror stories feature werewolves, as no other man-animal combination fills a reader or movie-watcher with the same dread.

## Will The Hunt Fix The Problem?


"The wolf's mournful howling and bark, that is because of that sorrow. He wishes he still had that communication and partnership with Anishinaabe," said Roger LaBine, chairman of the conservation committee of the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians.

"These wolves are territorial, and they are going to keep other wolves away. They are like the landlords. The thing you can hope for is to train the wolves not to harm livestock in the area," he said. If wolves get shot, the pack will scatter and other wolves will come in, he added.


Wolves were all but eradicated in much of the U.S. by the 1930s. Michigan and other Great Lakes states lost almost all of their wolves by the end of the 1950s.

LaBine said the Anishinaabe have welcomed the recovery and return of their "wolf brother." He is against the wolf hunt. He says fear leads to misunderstanding of the wolf. But by respecting the wolf, people would no longer have such fear.

The gray wolf was listed as [federally endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) in 1973. Oregon added its own protections in 1987, and state law requires agencies "to conserve wolves in Oregon," said Michelle Dennehy, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife.

## They're Back!


Any time a fire truck or police car passes by with blaring sirens, the hybrids' howls join a chorus of coyote yips and dog barks at Wolf Run Wildlife Refuge, which is nestled a little ways back from U.S. 27.

## Not Like A Zoo


The refuge is working harder than ever to spread awareness about the wolves, Baird said. New outreach programs allow people to get up close and personal with the animals.

## Watch Out Nibbles!


People often try to own wolf hybrids, thinking they're going to be like a dog, she said. Once the owners find out they can't handle the animals, the hybrids are often euthanized or taken to a sanctuary.

## Hit With A Golf Club


The dominant radio-collared wolverine in that drainage — dubbed Rocky by the researchers — has been known to cover the home ranges of two or three females, or about 700 square miles. "And that's a 30-pound animal," Rohrer said. "Most dogs are bigger than that."

"They are the superheroes of the animal world," said Shawn Sartorius, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "When you follow the tracks of these things, you see they are not taking the easy way around; they will go straight over mountaintops."


Serova ignored the makeup question. As for her hairdo, she shot back:

In 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space. She also got asked silly questions about hair and makeup before her space flight.


"I have a question for you — why don't you ask the question about Alexander's hair, for example," she said, referring to crewmate Alexander Samokutyaev seated next to her at the news conference. "I'm sorry, this is my answer. Thank you. More questions?"

## Russian Women Were First


Both Serova and Cristoforetti will spend six months aboard the 260-mile-high complex, following in the footsteps of nine American women who logged lengthy stays. Two of those U.S. women shared the place in 2010, with four men. Another two women rose to station commander rank.

Cristoforetti is the first woman sent on a long space station mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). Last month, the ESA landed the first spacecraft on a comet.


Cristoforetti is the first woman assigned to a lengthy space station mission by the European Space Agency, fresh off a spectacular comet landing of a spacecraft.

Serova is the first Russian woman to live at the space station. In 1963, Russia launched the world's first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova. In 1984, another Russian became the first woman to walk in space.


"If I had a daughter, I'd never let her jump — it's too much hard labor. Women have another purpose — to have children, to do housework, to create hearth and home,"

One by one, they flung themselves off the ramp at the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center, just like the male ski jumpers. They were all defying suggestions that the sport isn't right for women. Some people think it is too dangerous, unhealthy and unladylike.


The very first competitor to jump was 19-year-old American and reigning world champion Sarah Hendrickson. She blew out her knee last August, and just returned to jumping on Jan. 11. She had only 25 training jumps the past six months, while the other jumpers had 300-400.

Jessica Jerome was the top American in 10th place. Lindsey Van, who led the charge to get the sport recognized for women at the Olympics, finished 15th.


An Olympic VISA commercial was recently launched featuring Hendrickson and a recording made in 1937 of Amelia Earhart saying, "Please know I'm quite aware of the hazards. I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their failures must be but a challenge to others."

"We've already won,'' DeeDee Corrandini, president of Women's Ski Jumping USA, said just before the start of the event. "Every single ski jumper who's here has already won just to be here."


The woodrat's own quirky behavior hasn't helped. Allegheny woodrats exhibit the tendencies of other species collectively called pack rats — they collect shiny objects and bring them back to their nests for no apparent reason — from spent shotgun shells to soda cans, feathers and bones.

Not only people, but raccoons have helped kill off woodrats. Raccoons often have a type of roundworm living inside them. These worms don't hurt raccoons, but can kill woodrats. In Bergen County, there are many more raccoons than there used to be. "Where there are people, there are raccoons," said Valent. This is because raccoons can live on the food people throw away.


Human development has chopped up forested regions, creating more "edge" habitat that favors such woodrat predators as the great horned owl, Hassinger said. Other predators have also grown more prevalent, including black rat snakes and bobcats.

## A Poem To The "Boulder Bunny"


Palkopoulou and her colleagues wanted to see if the Wrangel Island mammoths, final members of a group on the brink of extinction, had diminished diversity in their DNA—a factor that might have contributed to their demise.

Scientists have already figured out which genes are in the human genome.


Barnes, who has worked with Palkopoulou but was not involved in this research, cautioned that this paper did not show that low genetic diversity is always a predictor of species fragility, and that scientists will have to figure out what to make of it when studying endangered animals.

### CON: A college-company partnership doesn't add up


So when the team for the 1950 World Cup was announced, it wasn't exactly big news across the country.

## Let's Just Play The Game


Bahr and his teammates held on to that lead for 64 minutes, until Spain scored three times in the final nine minutes to take a 3-1 win. Still, the game proved that the United States might just be able to play with these European teams.

In truth, it would have been foolish to think the United States could beat the mighty English.


And it remained 0-0, improbably, for most of the first half.

"Possession doesn't count — the goal counts, and we got the goal," Bahr said.


England had some quality chances but was denied by American goalkeeper Frank Borghi as well as the goalposts a couple of times.

## We Really Won!


Gaetjens caught just enough of it to change the ball's path and catch English goalkeeper Bert Williams flatfooted. Just like that, the Americans, almost impossibly, had a 1-0 lead.

"We couldn't even get the whole team on one flight," Bahr, 87, said. "We came back on three separate days and my wife was the only one at the airport that met me."


Well, almost.

"Tudo bem" — all good — as the Brazilians like to say.


Brazil made a nightmare start. Marcelo looked stunned, the crowd of 62,103 wailed and grown men watching in bars let out howls of despairing laughter when the Brazilian defender scored an own-goal that gave Croatia an unlikely 1-0 lead after just 11 minutes. And despite all the promises from government officials that Brazil would be ready, there were problems at the stadium: The lighting failed in one corner, flickering off, on, off and finally back on again after the late-afternoon kickoff.

The country roared to life Thursday with a joyous 3-1 win for the home team in a stadium barely readied on time for the first of 64 matches in 12 cities. The next month will consume planet _futebol_. It will also showcase Brazil's growth as a world power, problems and all.


Even the football-loving Pope Francis got a touch of World Cup fever. He sent a video message on Brazilian television before the match, saying that the world's most popular sport can promote peace and solidarity by teaching the importance of working hard to reach goals and respect for opponents.

"I'm very emotional, happy, and happy that it's over," said spectator Ricieri Garbelini, visibly drained. "I was nervous for five minutes at the beginning, and at the end."


But the party wasn't all fun-loving samba. In Sao Paulo, police fired canisters of tear gas and stun grenades to push back more than 300 demonstrators who gathered along a main highway leading to the stadium.

But as thousands of delegates gather at the United Nations in New York to begin reviewing progress made since 1995, women are still fighting for their rights. A pair of new studies puts that in sharp relief.

The problem that was discussed in Beijing was how to help women and children around the world get fair treatment and equal rights. U.N. members came up with a set of goals. They called it the "Platform for Action" and 189 countries agreed to it.


Fewer than 20 have female heads of state or government, according to a separate review, which U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will present to member states. Although women make up about half the global population, they account for only about 1 in 5 members of parliament. Half of all women are in paid employment, and wage disparities are a universal problem.

For most of his career, Demarest, who at 63 has a friendly chuckle and a trim beard, was a children's book author and illustrator, and then an official artist with the Coast Guard.

"If you look at the 19th century, you have this whole notion of progress through technology — the notion of science, the increasing organization of society," says Jan Schall, an art historian and curator of modern and contemporary art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri.

## Art Despaired Of War Itself


Poets and writers on both sides of the Atlantic at first cheered on the battle. Carl Sandburg's "Four Brothers" hailed the "Ballplayers, lumberjacks, ironworkers, ready in khaki / A million, ten million, singing, 'I am ready.'"

"You had mass death through mass technological warfare," he said. Cannons and machine guns were brutally efficient and deadly in trench warfare.


The war overran and destroyed the dream. The German artist and sculptor Kaethe Kollwitz turned out a series of deathly statues, woodcuts and posters. American painter John Singer Sargent also spent time at the front and responded with an epic testament to the crimes of war, the 20-foot-long painting "Gassed," in which blinded soldiers form a procession that mocks the ideal of military discipline.

## The Dream Destroyed


Among anti-war poems, few were so bitter, or indelible, as the British poet Wilfred Owen's "Dulce et Decorum Est," with its wretched images and scorn for the venerable adage "Dulce et Decorum est pro patria mori": ("It is sweet and proper to die for your country").

## Their Families Are Hungry


Another former military interpreter who moved to the U.S. in 2012 said one of his three sisters in Iraq was captured by ISIL militants last week and was keeping in touch with him through a cellphone she had smuggled into a jail beneath her clothing. Faisal, 33, asked that his last name not be used to protect her identity.

Fares Baki is 29 and moved to the United States from Iraq in December. Baki said his brother and his brother's four children have been trapped on Mount Sinjar without food or water.


Then Faisal fell silent.

"I'm just shocked and frozen — I can't even cry anymore," Faisal said.

He would coach with the Mets for eight seasons before becoming their manager in 1972 upon the death of Gil Hodges. That was the same year Berra not only was elected to the Hall of Fame but had his number 8 retired, along with fellow Yankees catching great Bill Dickey, who wore the same number.

Berra was the Yankees manager when they won the 1964 American League championship. Then the Yankees fired him when they lost that year's World Series to the Cardinals. Berra made a brief return to the field as a player-coach for the Mets the next year. He took his last turn at bat on May 9, 1965, when he was three days away from his 40th birthday.


Berra was named Yankees manager again in 1984 but was fired early in the 1985 season. He would wind down his career as a coach with the Houston Astros.

Later, Caldwell lost a climber's invaluable tool — a finger — in an accident with a table saw. He kept on climbing.

After the climb, Jorgeson said he hopes their climb inspires other people.

The last time a red fox was seen at Yosemite was in 1915, she said.

## Smile For The Camera


Determined to photograph the creature again, park wildlife biologists placed cameras in Tioga Pass, where the fox was seen years earlier. Then, in August 2010, a Sierra Nevada red fox was finally photographed near Sonora Pass, north of Yosemite.

In 1990, videos of the red fox were taken in the Lassen National Forest. The forest is north of Yosemite.


"Why lie to you? I was into that, too," Santos said.

"This is how families fall apart," said Nestor Vazquez Baeza, a dentist.


The following year, the dig was expanded. This August between 15 and 20 volunteers from around the world joined Quinhagak residents in a "field school," currently excavating the site that now stretches for about 150 yards.

## Grass Still Green After Centuries


At the center, archaeologists say they found a traditional large men's winter house. Smaller rooms connected by covered wooden walkways were added over the years, maybe as a way to bring in and protect women and children during the village wars, the researchers say. Traditionally, women and children lived separately from the men.

The old houses collapsed in the fire and over time, the site was hidden in the tall grasses.


Wellness court staff found Alvarado a job assisting a doctoral student in natural resource management who had come back to the reservation to research mid-sized carnivores. On a late fall afternoon, the two women sat together before the tribal council and Alvarado helped explain the transects they'd marked, the bones they had found, the maps she helped create.

## Aunts And Uncles


Even without that data there is already some indication the Zika-microcephaly connection is more than just geographical coincidence. There have also been reports of genetic material from Zika being detected in the blood tissue of a microcephalic baby from the northern Brazilian state of Pará. (That infant died within five minutes of birth.) And, anecdotally, some of the women who went on to birth children with microcephaly also remembered having a rash during pregnancy — a potential but not definitive symptom of Zika. In addition, beyond Brazil there have been reports in French Polynesia of an unusual uptick in central nervous system problems among babies born in the past couple years in areas associated with Zika outbreaks. Further lab testing of those mothers found that at least some of them may have had asymptomatic Zika virus.

Usually Zika is not a serious disease. Typically it only causes soreness and skin rashes. Zika has never been known to cause microcephaly before. 


But this information, by itself, is not yet airtight. In Brazil further investigations continue even as the government rolls out public health education and mosquito control efforts. If the new cord blood information and other research soon firms up the Zika-microcephaly connection, perhaps that will add further impetus to develop a vaccine for Zika — possibly by adapting one already in use for Zika's cousin, dengue.
However, scientists know very little about Zika. In fact, until 2007 there were only a few cases of people infected with the disease.


"He's very, very happy with the result," O'Mara told reporters. "I think it's probably going to settle on him tonight with his family when he realizes he doesn't have to come back to the courthouse tomorrow or ever again. I think he's still very, very worried."

## Many React In Disbelief


"Who was following who?" Bernie de la Rionda, who led the prosecution team, told reporters. "What it really boils down to is a kid minding his own business being followed by a stranger.... He gets accosted. He gets followed by an individual who wants to be a cop."

"This case has never been about race ... (or) about the right to bear arms," she said. "We believe that this case all along was about boundaries and that George Zimmerman exceeded those boundaries."


## Standards And Regulation

## Injuries Happened More Often On Business Zip Lines


But the earliest rocks and first evidences of life have been subject to dispute over the years. Some scientists, for example, maintain that the earliest evidence of life is about 3.8 billion years old and found in Isua, Greenland. Skeptics, however, note that no fossils were found in the Greenland rock. They point instead to 3.5 billion-year-old evidence of life found in rocks in Pilbara, Australia.

## Proving Its Age


"It's only one grain, mind you," he added, "but it's very significant."

They've shown "beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this grain is that old," said Samuel Bowring, an expert in the early history of the Earth. He's also a geology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bowring was not involved in the new study.


GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK, Mozambique — Forty years ago, 3,000 zebras roamed the 1,456 square miles of Gorongosa Park in Africa. After 15 years of civil war, perhaps 10 zebras remained by 2012.

GORONGOSA NATIONAL PARK, Mozambique — Every year, more than 180 million people visit zoos and aquariums in the United States. That's more people than go to major league baseball, football, hockey and basketball combined.


These zebras are symbols of the changing power of zoos.

## Where Have All The Zebras Gone?


To skeptics, Burns cites the role the Bronx Zoo played in saving the American bison.

The zebras in Mozambique, supported by zoo visitors 10,000 miles away, are an example of a new idea: zoos helping to protect animals in the wild.


The government of Mozambique and the Gorongosa Restoration Project have a 20-year contract to restore the park. Carr has promised to spend at least $40 million over those two decades.

## Bison Travel To New York


"In this world, we are always going to have conflicts between people and environmental issues," Wheeler says. "Senator Crapo has set a really great model in working collaboratively. There are some similarities in what Greg is doing in Mozambique and Gorongosa."

"There wouldn't be bison in this country if that had not happened," Burns said.

Their daughter's full name is Maxima Chan Zuckerberg, and she was born just before Thanksgiving, weighing 7 pounds, 8 ounces, according to a Facebook spokeswoman.

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia is another billionaire who has stepped forward. He is one of the richest men in the world. The prince has said he will give away all of his money.


While the alliance doesn't include any telecommunications providers or other Internet companies, one expert said the effort could help by lowering some of the cost hurdles that keep two-thirds of the world's population offline.

## "Don't Pretend To Be Saints"


"The hard fact is that what is in Web companies' self-interest — getting more people using the Internet — also expands the reach of American surveillance," tech commentator Alexis C. Madrigal warned in the Atlantic.

The group doesn't include any service companies. Facebook is the only Internet company involved. Still, one expert said the effort could help cut some of the costs that keep two-thirds of the world's population offline.
