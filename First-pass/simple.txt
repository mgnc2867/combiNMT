WASHINGTON — A group wants a woman to replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. It has four final choices that have been selected as possible replacements. More than 256,000 votes were cast to select the candidates.

Former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt is one of the final choices. So is Harriet Tubman, who campaigned against slavery, and civil rights activist Rosa Parks. The first woman elected chief of a major Native American tribe, Wilma Mankiller, is also on the list. People can now vote for one of the four. The group behind the push, Women on 20s, has not yet decided when to end the voting.

WASHINGTON — For generations, Asian-Americans have lived on the coasts of the United States. Recently, thousands have moved to the South, changing the communities where they have settled.

Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South between 2000 and 2010. The Asian-American population there increased 69 percent in those years, according to a government count of the country's population.

The average growth of the Asian-American population in the region was 63 percent. Twelve states and the District saw increases of 50 percent or more. By comparison, the Latino population grew 57 percent in the South.

YUENDUMU, Australia — The elders of the Warlpiri tribe in Australia look at a person's footprints. A good person, they believe, leaves good prints in the red dust.

Four years ago, Sebastian Watson got into trouble and his footsteps were said to have turned bad. The elders of his community sent him off to Mount Theo. On the mountain, Peggy Brown and her husband care for troubled youth.

She made Watson healthy on the outside with good food and healthy living. She also worked to make him strong on the inside. She surrounded him with the ancient way of life of the Warlpiri, one of the original peoples of Australia. The Warlpiri have a deep connection to the land, to family and to the spirit world.

Desperate, the elders called a community meeting. That is where they came up with the idea to send troubled youth to Mount Theo, which the Walpiri believe has healing qualities. The elders wanted to heal them and teach them about being Warlpiri.

His dad told him to "Google it."

So Shubham did. With a few Internet searches he learned about Braille, the writing system used by the blind. Braille is printed with raised dots on paper. Blind people read the dots with their fingers. He also learned about Braille printers. To the middle schooler's shock, he discovered they cost thousands of dollars.

## They Can Be Trouble

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Lynda Walsh wants kids to look good no matter how little money they have.

In Florida, she saw how poorly many kids were dressed when they went to court.

Walsh asked friends and family to give their clothes to her store. They also helped organize the space. Walsh's 93-year-old mother washes and irons some of the donated clothes.

The Clothes Closet opened its doors about four months ago. The children who have been helped so far have been grateful, Walsh said.

Roberta Mizrahi is a volunteer at the store. She said that the kids are often shy about trying on the clothes at first. They get excited when they try on something they like, she said.

"I think it's wonderful," she added.

Muinos sees about 30 children every Friday. He works to create a plan for each child based on age, height and body mass index (BMI). BMI measures the amount of body fat based on a person's height and weight.

"I feel much better about myself," Sanchez said. "I have a lot more energy."

ORLANDO, Fla. — A bunch of Coyotes will be let loose in hurricanes this year. Their mission: to improve hurricane forecasts.

## Little Drones On A Big Mission

On Sunday, city crews moved the finish line into place. The city trucked in snow to give the mushers a path once they leave the Bering Sea ice.

"Yeah, I know, it's funny to see people dumping snow on a street instead of taking it off the street," said Greg Bill, an organizer of the Iditarod. "To really dress it up and make it safe for the dog teams, we have to spread a layer of snow down for them to run on."

King last won in 2006. He is trying to be only the second musher to win five races.

Zirkle has come in second place in the last two years. She is seeking to become only the third woman to win the race. And she would be the first woman to win since the late Susan Butcher in 1990.

Other front-runners include four-time champion Martin Buser. He arrived in Koyuk in third place Sunday. He was followed 13 minutes later by 2012 Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey.

"Any dogs that can laugh when they run, with their tongues hanging out, they got my heart right now," said Cross.

The race began March 2 with 69 teams. As of late Sunday morning, 16 mushers had scratched, leaving 53 teams on the trail. Long stretches of bare and rocky ground made for an icy, dangerous trail in the early part of the race.

This preparatory work has already burped up plenty of swag from the prehistoric period before humans. Officials had anticipated encountering a large number of fossils: The dig is near the famed La Brea Tar Pits, where many prehistoric remains have been discovered over the years. And it features sandy soil rich with natural asphalt. That makes for ideal conditions for fossils.

Paleontologists have recovered mollusks, asphalt-covered sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and cones from Monterey cypress trees. For Scott, two finds are particularly exciting. One is a rock that seems to contain part of a sea lion's mouth, perhaps 2 million years old. The other is a non-fossilized 10-foot limb from a digger pine tree. That tree would look right at home today in Central California woodlands.

If Chester Nez dared to use his Navajo language in school, he was punished right away. First, he had to scrub his tongue with a toothbrush. Then, he had to wash out his mouth with bitter soap.

That day, Nez was invited to join a top-secret group known as the Navajo code talkers. Using the Navajo language, they developed an unbreakable military code. Then, they risked their lives on battlefields across the Pacific. For the rest of World War II, Navajo code talkers sent and decoded highly important military messages. They helped win victories and save lives.

Nez didn't have to volunteer. [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American) were hardly considered citizens back then. But Nez's pride in his people spoke louder than years of rejection. "I reminded myself that my Navajo people had always been warriors, protectors," he wrote years later. "In that there was honor. I would concentrate on being a warrior, on protecting my homeland."

But it has had to defend itself after Aaron Hernandez's arrest in connection with a shooting death.

But New England took a chance. It selected the University of Florida star in the fourth round of the 2010 draft. That seemed like a bargain. The move paid off for three seasons. Hernandez reached the Pro Bowl in 2011. He was given a five-year contract extension worth as much as $40 million.

Today, Hernandez is being held without bail in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd. Hernandez told a judge he is not guilty. The Patriots cut Hernandez less than two hours after he was arrested. The team also let fans exchange their used Hernandez jerseys for those of any other Patriot.

The WHO gave credit to Nigeria's "world-class" disease detective work.

If Nigeria can beat Ebola, other countries can limit Ebola to just a handful of cases, said Dr. Margaret Chan. She is the director general of the WHO.

At the beginning of the Ebola outbreak, Nigeria was in the middle of a strike by doctors and nurses. A strike is when workers stop working to protest something. Dr. Doyin Oduyebo took part in Nigeria's effort to stop Ebola. He said medical officials feared the disease would get out of control.

"We were afraid because we knew the epidemic was raging in other West African countries," Oduyebo said. "So we decided to give it everything to bring it under control."

At a hospital, Sawyer kept important information from the doctor examining him. He did not tell the doctor that he had collapsed at the airport. Sawyer also did not say his sister recently died of Ebola, and he helped bury her.

Malala has become a symbol of hope in Pakistan. Girls there are sometimes killed by their own families in "honor killings" if they dare to marry for love. They are even kept out of school in very traditional communities.

The new optional essay test will be graded separately, said the College Board. The College Board is the company that owns the widely used exam.

Some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad message.

"I'm not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy. She is president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling.

In one area, the College Board will be making it harder. Now test takers are allowed to use calculators for math questions. But starting in two years, calculators won't be allowed during some of the math testing.

SEATTLE - Suicide haunts Indian Country. More native youth take their own lives than in any other population. And not only in Washington state. Nationally, too.

The state of Washington studied the number of native youth ages 10 to 24 who killed themselves. It found the rate was more than double that of any other ethnic group.

Tribal leaders in the Lummi Nation started a youth suicide prevention program last year. The Colville, Spokane and Yakama tribes are using prevention grants and training through the Native Aspirations Program. The program has helped 65 tribes across the country combat suicide for the past five years.

"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner. She heads the Youth Suicide Prevention Program in Seattle. It works with schools and parent groups to teach the warning signs of suicide and ways to stop it.

The poverty and isolation that is common in Indian Country raise the risk of suicide. Making matters worse are the shortage of mental health services. Drug and alcohol addiction and family problems have an effect, too, Wagner said. "There is this feeling of being trapped, and having nowhere to go."

## Positives Over Negatives

## Familiar Struggles

BISMARCK, N.D. — President Theodore Roosevelt was a great outdoorsman and lover of nature. He created hundreds of national forests, parks and monuments during his presidency. His history, though, is being preserved online.

A group of Roosevelt scholars and fans are completing a design for a library and museum to honor his life. Unlike other presidential libraries, Roosevelt's will exist mainly on the Internet.

The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, about 35 miles east of the Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota. The national park is located partly on ranchland Roosevelt once owned. The library has already made thousands of documents, letters and photographs available online.

## The "Cradle Of Conservation"

The bus brought a group of Chinese tourists to a California mall. Most hurried off to buy luggage that they planned to stuff with high-end clothes, shoes and bags.

But not Guoshing Cui, a Samsung supervisor from Guangzhou. He went straight to the Coach store and picked out three expensive handbags. He paid more than $800 from a wad of $100 bills.

The bags were gifts for family and friends in China. Coach goods sell there for two to three times the price in the United States. "It's a smart move," he said of his purchases.

Chinese tourists are the highest-spending visitors to the United States. Their shop-'til-you-drop habit makes them the customers that malls and tour bus operators want most.

"They don't like to lay on the beaches," said Ernest Wooden Jr., president of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board. "What they do like is shopping."

Foreign visitors to the United States spent more than ever in 2012, according to U.S. officials. That money from Chinese visitors helped set the new record of $168.1 billion.

Japanese tourists spend a lot at restaurants because foods like red meat cost much more at home.

Many Chinese visitors also stock up on vitamins in the United States. They don't trust the quality of vitamins sold back home.

Ding Sheng, a tourist from China, said he took a tour to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. He was planning to see the casinos of Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon. But he said a shopping outing to the outlet mall was the highlight of the trip.

Chinese tourists may spend heavily on gifts and souvenirs. But the travelers typically cut back on food and lodging, tour guides say.

NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine — Russian tanks and military vehicles fired missiles at the Ukrainian military on the border Thursday, a top Ukrainian official said. Ukraine's border guards were overmatched and fled. Russian troops then rolled into the country, he said.

A top NATO official said at least 1,000 Russian troops have poured into Ukraine and fought with Ukrainian soldiers. He said another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border.

## An Important Town Taken

"We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons," Tak said. He said the weapons are being given to rebels in eastern Ukraine.

Alexander Zakharchenko is the leader of the rebels. He said on Russian television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought on the side of the rebels.

The U.S. government accused Russia of helping rebel forces expand their fight. It said Russia sent in tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles.

U.S. government spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday that Russia was hiding its actions, even from its own people.

Russian forces, she said, are being sent inside Ukraine without them or their families knowing where they are going. She mentioned reports of burials in Russia for those who have died in Ukraine.

## Term Describes Some Rich Kids

ANDKHOY, Afghanistan — Esmatullah is a day worker who got engaged in 1999 at age 26. His bride-to-be was a young girl from a village near his hometown in western Afghanistan. The marriage was arranged by his relatives, and he was eager to wed. Fourteen years later, Esmatullah is still waiting.

Afghan weddings come with many old traditions, and one of them is the custom known as walwar. It requires the groom-to-be to pay cold cash to the bride's father. The bride and groom's families haggle over the amount, which can top $20,000. For many working-class Afghans, it's a sum they cannot dream of affording.

Andkhoy is a town of carpet makers and wheat farmers, where many fiances borrow from relatives and friends. They have to pay the money back over months or years. For common laborers like Esmatullah, the amount is far out of reach. His future in-laws insist on $13,000. Friends and relatives lent him $8,000. But he has no way of coming up with the rest.

"I make $6 a day as a day laborer," says Esmatullah, who only uses one name, like many Afghans. "God knows how long it will take me to raise the rest."

Walwar is against the law in Afghanistan. But officials still allow it because it has been a part of Afghan tribal life for centuries. Fathers or grooms who make walwar payments are rarely punished, Mostafavi says. It also unfairly loads young grooms with the burden of debt, she adds.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Hot dogs are rarely seen in Afghanistan. So it was very unusual when five trucks painted to look like giant hot dogs showed up on the streets of the capital this year.

The man behind the new food trucks is 25-year-old Naveed Noori. He is based in Kabul, but his wife and daughter live in Toronto, Canada. While in Toronto, Noori was introduced to food trucks, and now he has brought them to Afghanistan.

The cousins plan to double their fleet to 10 trucks. They also plan to launch a home delivery service and make their first video ad. For now, Noori said, they sell about $450 in food every day, enough to make a small profit each month.

Lazeez employee Rohit Shuja had never cooked before he applied to work for the new company. Now, he grills chicken and works the fryer like a pro.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — When the doctors and therapists met the little girl from Afghanistan, they knew she was missing her arm. Making her a new one would change her life.

But they couldn't have guessed what she would do with it.

Less than a year ago, Shah Bibi was at home in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan). She went outside one morning to play with her brother. There had been a dangerous battle between Taliban fighters and U.S. military forces the night before. But that was nothing villagers weren't used to. Their village had been a center of violence since the Afghan war began.

"There was what looked like a rock that she picked up and threw on the ground and it exploded," said Ilaha Omar, a Children of War Foundation member. She brought her to the United States, where Shriners Hospital treated her for free.

The explosion had destroyed her right eye. It took off most of her right arm, put a few scars on her face, and killed her brother.

BAND-E AMIR NATIONAL PARK, Afghanistan — Of all the effects of war on Afghanistan, among the most unusual — and perhaps the happiest — is swan boats.

Partly that's due to the peacefulness and beauty of the remote region, which is high in the Hindu Kush of central Afghanistan. Four years ago it became Afghanistan's first national park.







Noori is from Bamiyan and helps deliver babies. She said she, her husband and their three young children had visited the park 11 times. They'd made three trips so far this year.

Despite its beauty, the park is little known in the West. Perhaps 20 Western visitors come in an average month, mostly aid workers from Kabul.

Like much in Afghanistan, a visit to Band-e Amir often is mixed with religion. The Baqers' son has epilepsy, and they hoped that the powers of the waters would help.

Beliefs in the lakes' ability to heal are based on the role Ali is said to have had in their creation. He was the cousin of the Prophet Muhammad. Near the boats is a popular shrine dedicated to him.

Ali is said to have created the lakes through amazing feats. With a slash of his sword he's said to have created the valley and then made dams out of cheese.





KABUL, Afghanistan -- Mohammad Aziz Ayob adjusts his Boy Scout neckerchief, leans over and plants a sapling into the dry Kabul soil. Two helicopters pass overhead, the clack-clack clack-clack of their blades echoing off the neighboring mountains.

It may seem dangerous for young boys to wear matching uniforms in a war zone. But Afghan Scout leaders say the organization has a lot to offer. They believe community service is badly needed in a country that's suffered years of war and violence. So is learning to rely on yourself.

Ayob, orphaned as a child and raised by his aunt, can barely afford to attend high school. He worries about finding a job. Such worries disappear when he puts on his Scouting shirt. "I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud," said Ayob, 18. "Scouts are like my family."

## Afghan Scouting At Risk

"That's awesome," Jenks said. He measured Salim for a new prosthetic arm.

Today, its street are crowded with traffic and bordered with concrete blast walls. After recent bombing attacks, the blast walls were put up almost overnight. They appear in rows outside government buildings, businesses and the homes of powerful people. They protect the people inside from bombs and bullets.

## Changing Perceptions Of Who Is Heroic

Artists from his group recently painted a picture of street sweepers in orange work jackets and traditional scarves on a blast wall. Next to it, they wrote,"The Heroes of My City: The Street Sweepers." The words are written in large black letters that can be clearly seen by drivers in the street.

Ahmad Jan is a 26-year-old worker. He stopped one sunny afternoon to look at the mural. "It's interesting to Afghans," he said. "Everybody crossing the street will take a look and read the message and then get a different" view.

Volunteer Maryam Kohi comes every day to help paint. She said the walls are blocking the streets and "make the city look like a prison." The city is polluted with dirt and officials are not honest. She said they are corrupt, which means they take money for favors. "With these paintings we want to take our anti-corruption message to the people," Kohl said.

## Dishonesty, Corruption Hurt Afghanistan

KABUL, Afghanistan — Weapons can be seen almost everywhere in Afghanistan these days. After all, the country has been fighting various wars for years.

## Shot In The Eye By Toys

WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Barack Obama said on Thursday that the United States will keep nearly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan through most of next year. He added that there would still be 5,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2017. The president leaves office in January of that year.

## Hunters Pay A Lot Of Money For Big Game

The new changes have given hope to many in Africa. Still, there is war and many people on the continent are poor.

Sy said Africa's population has been growing quickly. African countries are becoming richer. Yet, the number of poor people is not dropping as fast there as in other parts of the world.

Almost half of the people in sub-Saharan Africa still live on less than $1.25 a day, says the United Nations. Sub-Saharan Africa is the area south of the Sahara Desert. The United Nations is a group of countries that work together.

Experts also see signs of trouble.

For a while, prices for oil and other goods were high. Africa has much oil, and sells it. High oil prices are good for Africa. Now prices are dropping. China and Europe buy oil from Africa. Problems in both areas are making Africa's leaders nervous.

## Nine African Countries In Report

MOSCOW — Growing up in Russia, Emilia Tynes-Mensah did the same things other children did. She read the books of Alexander Pushkin and listened to the music of Peter Tchaikovsky.

In her home, though, there was also American music and Thanksgiving celebrations. There were stories of the struggles facing blacks in the United States. Soul food sometimes replaced Russian beet soup.

NEW YORK — In West Africa, Nasser Diallo had a good job working as a reporter for a radio station. That all came to an end in 2009, he said.

Jeanne Batalova, who is with the MPI, called it a waste of brains.

Africans from English-speaking countries such as Nigeria and South Africa have an easier time, according to Jeff Gross. He is with the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA).

Others are struggling. Among recently arrived African immigrants, two out of five do not have good jobs. In comparison, one out of five college-educated American-born workers do not have good jobs, according to the MPI.

## Wanting More For Their Children

CHICAGO — On a recent afternoon, a group of 9- and 10-year-old African-American girls talked about beauty.

They all agreed that women with short, kinky hair were not beautiful. But then Ladon Brumfield, founder of the group Girls Rule!, passed around a photograph of Lupita Nyong'o. The dark-skinned actress wears her hair extra-short. The girls were silent for a moment.

Then, once again, they all agreed: Nyong'o was beautiful.

## Afros, Braids And Twists

Roberts said women considered long hair "healthy" and "professional." Short hair was considered the most "professional" and "classy." And natural hair was seen as expressing confidence. All of the styles were considered attractive.

ST. LOUIS — High school programs on agriculture are popping up all across the middle of the country. The classes are teaching teenagers that working in the field does not always mean dealing with cows and plows.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/UN_AGING_2050_Edit.jpg" />The world is getting old fast. In fact, it is happening so fast that most countries are not ready to support the growing numbers of old people, according to a study from the United Nations and an elder rights group.

The report ranks the social and economic well-being of elders in 91 countries. Sweden comes out on top. Afghanistan is last. People who fight for the elderly have been warnings about this for years. They have been saying that nations are simply not working quickly enough to prepare for a population that is aging faster than ever before.

When people in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, have questions about farming they call Seth Wilner. For 15 years he has been a farming expert in the community.

"Used to be, someone in my county called up and said, 'I have a llama and two goats, can you come out and look at my pasture?'" Wilner said.

Extension still shares science aimed at helping farms and ranches make money. Now, it also works on a wide range of other issues, like teaching job skills, the environment and making people healthier.

TRACY, Calif. — Technology is one of the newest businesses. It is joining forces with the world's oldest business — farming. The businesspeople behind technology are putting their money and talents into farming. They have serious goals. They want to make sure there is enough food for the 10 billion people expected to live on the planet by 2100. They also hope to make a lot of money along the way.

Experts think that ag-tech will take off. Paul Matteucci said ag-tech is going to be big because "everybody eats." He works at a company called U.S. Venture Partners that invests money in new companies. He also founded Feeding 10 Billion, a center to help ag-tech businesspeople who want to start new companies.

LOS ANGELES — Help wanted: At least 130 veteran military pilots. Must make a nine-year commitment to fly fighter jets.

That offer comes from the U.S. Department of Defense. It is so short of Air Force fighter pilots that it is offering more money than ever before to help attract pilots.





















SEATTLE — Steve Osmek is standing next to flowers and plants, talking about nature. But every 45 seconds or so, a jet flies overhead and drowns out his words.

He's used to the planes by now. Osmek is the resident wildlife biologist at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. He is in charge of making sure animals play nice with the planes. "If it moves, if it has legs, I'm responsible," he says.

Sometimes, it's simply a matter of keeping animals out. The 12-foot fence that stops coyotes and deer from wandering onto the runways is one example. But it's more complicated for the airport's greatest wildlife problem: birds.

When a bird and an airplane hit each other, it is called a bird strike. Those bird strikes cost airlines $700 million a year, according to the government. They have also killed more than 200 people in the last 25 years. A flight that hit a flock of geese and landed safely was called "Miracle on the Hudson" for good reason.  Sea-Tac had its own emergency landing in 2002 when a plane hit 26 birds.

Sea-Tac was the first airport to hire a wildlife biologist, in the 1970s. A few airports across the country have wildlife biologists on staff. Most let people at the U.S. Department of Agriculture do the work.

## Missions Shaped Texas History

The Alamo is the best known of the Missions. A famous battle took place there in 1836. A small band of Texas settlers were attacked by Mexican soldiers. The settlers were greatly outnumbered but fought bravely. In the end, they fell to General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his Mexican forces. The settlers' courage has been honored ever since by the words, "Remember the Alamo!"

LONDON, England — British actor Alan Rickman has died. He was 69. 

Gina McCarthy became head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last month. She said the residents' words remind her of what the EPA works for every day.

"I intend to make you proud in the position the president has given me," she said. Her speech took place in a packed gymnasium at a Dillingham school. The audience stood up and applauded her.

McCarthy's visit to the Bristol Bay region comes as more people across the country are discussing the possible mine. It could be the largest open-pit mine in North America. The problem for many? It's in a region that produces half the world's wild red salmon.

The area of the mine is a wide green stretch bursting with lakes and streams. This sweeping land is surrounded by mountains. Moose, caribou and grizzly bears roam there.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — It is spring break for middle school students in south-central Alaska. Many spent it playing video games, skiing or just enjoying a lazy week away from school. Grayson Davey is an eighth-grader. He spent most of his week off looking for people to work for his company.

Grayson said he does not think enough people follow their dreams.

A 2013 study on lakes near the mines showed increased pollution, said Joshua Kurek. There was also more ecological change. Kurek is a lead author of the study.

QINGDAO, China — For Li Lejun, there's one easy way to make the beach even better than expected. Just add seaweed — hundreds and hundreds of tons of it.

Li's back was covered in what looked like strands of bright yellow cotton candy. The 7-year-old boy from Beijing was having the time of his life Sunday at No. 1 Bathing Beach in this city 350 miles north of Shanghai.

Men nearby in swim briefs used pitchforks to throw mounds of seaweed into a yellow front-end loader. In the other direction, a backhoe scooped big piles of it into dump trucks. On Saturday, Lejun and his 69-year-old grandpa had helped gather globs of it from the sea.

## A Carpet Wide And Deep

## Playing On A Green Beach

The seaweed can rot and give off toxic fumes if left for more than a day. In 2009, a Frenchman riding his horse came across piles of it along the coast. Both he and the horse fainted, and the horse died.

Large mats of seaweed can also be dangerous to sea plants and animals. They can get thick enough and dense enough to steal oxygen from patches of ocean.

School districts in Texas like the decision because it gives them more choices in how they teach students. But experts are concerned. Nearly 20 states have followed Texas' lead in requiring algebra II. And experts worry these states may follow Texas' lead in dropping it.

Texas' change of heart came after strong pressure from Jobs for Texas. It is an organization made up of 22 business groups. The group argued that the state's classes didn't meet the needs of the modern workforce.

The study looked at the motion of certain sea animals that are not related to each other. Scientists found that their swim strokes follow a similar ratio. They think this shows a case of convergent evolution. Convergent evolution is when two totally different species develop similar traits as they both adapt to living in similar environments.

Cutting down trees in the Amazon gets a huge amount of attention. Scientists worry about that, but they also worry about something just as important. The freshwater ecosystems in the Amazon basin need protection, too.

BALTIMORE — Frogs, toads and salamanders are disappearing at a surprisingly fast pace across the United States, a new study shows.

Scott Stranko, a Maryland biologist, said there are fewer of some of the salamanders that are more sensitive to changes in the land or the quality of the water.

"Basically, they die of thirst" even in the water, Snodgrass said.
The largest number of reports involved motion sickness. Those people fainted, felt sick to their stomachs or were dizzy. Back and neck pain ranked second. Head injuries came in third.

Together, the parks reported about 350 injuries a year. More than 40 million people visited the parks each year.

—Many of the injured visitors already had health problems.

"We are at the top of the (injury) list because we are the top of the list for attendance," said Greg Hale. He is in charge of safety for Disney's theme parks.

In 2012, Joan Brown rode Space Mountain with her family.

When she got off the ride, she kept asking, "Where are we going?" said her husband. Later, the doctors said she had lost her memory for a short time.

Space Mountain opened in 1977. Its age may be connected to its number of injuries. Older rides seem to cause more injuries than newer ones. Of the 10 rides with the most injuries, six are at least 20 years old. Only one was built in the last 10 years.

Rides are safer than they used to be 30 or 40 years ago, said Dennis Speigel. He is president of International Theme Park Services in Ohio. The worst injures happen when rides are broken. In 2009, a cable broke on the Xcelerator roller coaster at Knot's Berry Farm in California. It ripped through the ride's car. A 12-year-old boy was hurt.

Scientists think the ship sunk around 60 B.C.

"Big Hero 6" was a huge success for Disney in many ways. It made more than $500 million at the box office. Fans and critics loved it. It even won the Oscar for best animated film.

Computer-animated films are big business. In most years, a couple of the top 10 box office hits are animated. Companies can often sell toys, clothes and other items based on the movies. These products can bring in a lot of money.

That's what happened with Disney Animation's "Frozen." The animated movie brought in $1 billion worldwide in ticket sales. It also made more money in other ways for the Walt Disney Company.

Now, scientists are able to peer into the heart of fire-ant rafts. They have discovered that the insects link their bodies together to create strong yet lightweight structures. This knowledge may one day help engineers build buildings and bridges that can repair themselves.

The towers, bridges and boats that ants build are remarkable. They're strong, light and adapt to the conditions around them. The ants are both the construction workers and the raw materials. They use their bodies like the beams in a building. Instead of nailing those beams together, they reach out and touch each other.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Last year, a California high school student walked out of class and collapsed. She had received a text from one of her parents to come home to talk about her grades. The girl, a star athlete and generally straight-A student, had received a D.

Overfelt High School in San Jose, Calif., has seen a sudden rise in panic attacks among students. Panic attacks are intense fears of something bad happening. Nearby schools have seen a lot of anxiety this past fall among teens as well.

Judith Cameron is with the San Ramon Valley Unified School District. She said the students are coming to school with more mental health problems and at a younger age.

Not all schools have reported an increase in mental illness. But not every school has people watching out for it. Likewise, not every school has therapists to work with students.

"They're not expected to be great. They're expected to be" amazing, said Cristy Dawson. She is the assistant principal at Los Altos High.

Sometimes, anxiety grows into fear. "Kids are so depressed or anxious, they're not getting out of bed," said Helen Hsu. She is with the city of Fremont's Youth and Family Services. The department provides therapists to several schools.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Some students take classes in high school that are as difficult as college classes. They are called Advanced Placement (AP) classes. They are harder than regular high school lessons. Students who do well in them can take a test at the end. If they get a good test grade they will get points for college. Class points are called credits.

NEW YORK — Apple Stores are no longer just a place to buy the latest phone or computer. They are now also a space in which to see works of art. Apple Stores around the country are showing artworks made on iPhones and computers.

EXCELSIOR, Minn. — On a late fall afternoon, David Bedford plucks an apple from a young tree. He bites into the fruit and chews thoughtfully.

He declares it is "perfectly good," but no more than that. It's "not excellent — not a wow." He tosses the apple to the ground, then sprays a stripe of orange paint on the trunk that tells the orchard crew to take it down. "You're going to the firewood farm," he tells the tree, with a grin.

Bedford is calm and easygoing. However, he is unforgiving in his attempts to produce the next great apple.

Bedford works as a scientist for the University of Minnesota's apple-breeding program. During peak apple season, he tastes around 500 to 600 apples a day.

Apple Inc. wants new music released through its iTunes store before it comes out anywhere else.

"I almost choked," she said. "It was shocking."

GENEVA, N.Y. — The trees at Cornell University's research orchard this fall are loaded with apples. There are waxy apples, deep-red apples, round apples, oval apples. You can smell autumn in the air.

The thousands of trees here are tended for a single goal: to grow apples with just the right mix of sweetness, tartness and crunch.

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — Using fish to make fertilizer isn't a new idea. But John Morris is doing it in a modern way called aquaponics.

Many animals could become part of the faunal exchange. Birds such as Arctic terns, common eiders, Atlantic puffins and short-tailed shearwaters may start to move between the Atlantic and the Pacific. Beluga whales, ringed seals and Atlantic white-sided dolphins may do so as well.

The Arctic, the area around the North Pole, is melting. As it melts, scientists are discovering strange things: mysterious craters, ice that burns, slow-moving mudslides, and leaning trees.

Scientists are trying to explain craters that have appeared in northern Russia where ice has melted.

The waves in the Arctic seas have gotten a lot bigger.

Huge islands of ice cover much of the chilly Arctic waters near the North Pole. Near the edges, the ice is made up of tiny floating pieces. Farther inside, however, it is packed into a nearly solid mass.

Victor Brabble works for the government agency that protects the U.S. border. He said the Border Patrol urges people to be careful when providing aid to crossers.

"We do have a common goal," Brabble said: to protect border crossers from the dangers of the desert.

In 2005, problems between aid groups and Border Patrol agents reached a peak in Arivaca. That year, aid volunteers Daniel Strauss and Shanti Sellz were arrested. They were charged with smuggling after they tried to drive three men to a hospital. A judge dismissed the case a year later.

Another aid volunteer, Daniel Millis, was found guilty of littering. He had left bottles of water for border crossers in the desert near Arivaca. A judge cleared him of the charge two years ago.

Since then, government officials have backed off. They are no longer trying to arrest aid workers.

RALEIGH, N.C. — A ready-to-eat Army meal can survive a 1,200-foot parachute drop and stay fresh for up to three years. But if it doesn't taste good to a soldier, it's going straight to the trash.

That's a problem researchers at North Carolina State University want to solve. Their solution is to pull out the nutrients from tasty fruits and vegetables and put them into foods like snack bars.

Lila and her researchers received $60,000 from food companies to help with their project. They money will allow them to test their new way of pulling out and transplanting vital nutrients. They got to chose one fruit and one vegetable for testing.

## Bring The Paintings Home

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists were drawing auction bids from collectors. Outside on the street, the artists traded the latest gossip from Syria. Periodically, they checked their smartphones for news from the civil war in that country.

Such is the divided life of these Syrian artists, who are now based here in Dubai. Brought to the Gulf state by their gallery, they are able to continue their work in safety. At the same time, they remain deeply connected to Syria. They are all influenced by the bloodshed they left behind.

There are now more than 2 million Syrian refugees. And their number is growing. During the past two years, they have fanned out across the region. Some live in tent camps in Jordan. Others are trying to build new lives in cities such as Beirut and Istanbul.

The auction in Dubai's art district this past Monday is part of a small but forward-looking effort. Syria's civil war has already claimed more than 100,000 lives. With no end in sight, the goal is to save part of the country's artistic community.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Over the next 50 years, a new study says, there will be major changes in who immigrates to the United States. More people will move here from different countries than they do now.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Pranee Wilcox worked as accountant back home in Thailand, a country in Asia. She had a college degree. Yet she still struggled to make ends meet. In 2001, the Thai ambassador offered her a job as his housekeeper in the Washington, D.C., embassy. She said yes — even though that meant leaving her babies behind in Thailand. Wilcox figured she would make much more money working in the United States.

Four years later, when her boss returned to Thailand, Wilcox decided to stay, although that meant living in the United States without papers and speaking very little English. Desperate for money, she worked 12-hour days, six days a week. First she worked as a cook, then in a nail salon. She sent the money back to her family.

"I still feel like I'm not a success yet," said Wilcox, age 44. She was taking a break from giving manicures and pedicures at a D.C. salon. Her goal is to become a U.S. citizen.

## More Asians, Pacific Islanders Living In U.S.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — The crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 has given the safety improvements of the past 30 years the chance to prove how much they matter.

As sad as the loss of three young lives in the crash is, 304 people lived. In other words, almost everybody survived.

The loss of life was "nowhere near what you would have anticipated, " said Larry Rooney. He is an executive with an important pilots group.

Several things helped save lives. Seats were stronger and fireproof.  Materials inside the cabin and around the cargo areas slowed down flames from spreading. Lighted strips on the floor led to the exits.  Flight attendants were also taught to speak up when they saw something wrong. And pilots were taught to pay attention to them.

The Boeing 777 that crashed July 6 has a record as one of the safest planes in the sky, said Kevin Hiatt. He is president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation.

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Scientists are planning to pluck, push and park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.

Most of us hope to dodge space rocks. But NASA has an ambitious, $105 million plan. It wants to build a spaceship and drag one closer to Earth. It's a first step in a future voyage to Mars.

## A Stepping-Stone into Space

SAN JOSE, Calif. — NASA wants to find and track asteroids and it has decided to ask the public for ideas. Some asteroids have the ability to wipe out life as we know it. Finding asteroids might mean securing the future of planet Earth.

In February 2013, 65-foot-wide asteroid exploded over Russia. It unleashed the force of 500,000 tons of TNT. Nobody had known it existed before. Afterward, NASA launched a series of contests. The space agency wanted to come up with ways to keep an eye on asteroids that could threaten Earth.

Currently, NASA thinks that we have only found 1 percent of the asteroids out there. And there are millions flying around our solar system.

Scientists separate the yips into two types. One is neurological, or physically related to the nerves and the brain. The other is psychological, something that is not physical and is in the player's mind.

Castro first experienced the yips more than 10 years ago. He had played golf since he was 6 and was especially active in high school, but when he went to college, he stopped playing so frequently. That's when he first felt the yips.

## History Helps Shape An Idea

LOS ANGELES – Doctors can't usually be sure a child has autism until the child is at least 2. But, a new study finds that early signs can seen even at 2 months of age.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. - A year and a half ago, a group of high school science students in Missouri helped make a chair called the Sensory Lounger. Since then, the chair has received a lot of attention.

## Wings For Autism Helps Out

Jennifer Bishop was also at the airport with her son, Nathaniel Epstein, who is 14 years old. Nathaniel had been on a plane once before when he was 4. The trip was very hard because Nathaniel was scared. Ten years later, his mother was ready to try again.

Because some children with autism cannot talk, the thoughts occupying their heads are unable to come out. That's where the iPad comes in. Through the app of their choice, the children can form sentences by putting together words, which come in the form of buttons and a picture to match the word. Then they play the sentences back for others to hear. The iPad becomes their voice.

This improves "their understanding of the world around them," says teacher Danielle Skala. She has a few students who use iPads in her classroom.

Zach's Voice was founded by Abby Whitworth, who named the group after her 7-year-old son. Whitworth was inspired by Zach's experience with the iPad. Before the Apple product, he used DynaVox, a heavy device that was hard to program, Whitworth said. Besides being clunky, it drew attention to him. With an iPad, he blends in.

The app recommended by Zach's Voice is ProLoQuo2Go. However, the group provides a gift card that covers the cost of whatever app families decide to download. Jaime chose Lamp Words for Life, a program he was already familiar with.

ProLoQuo2Go lets kids add words to the program. For example, they can add family members' names or the names of their favorite cartoon characters.

Entering information into a computer can be boring. It's also hard to do it well and quickly. But Shane Foley is great at it.

The 21-year-old Maryland man works on two computer screens. He looks at images of handwritten sheets on one. He types the information into the other. His boss praises him. So does the head of the agency he is doing the work for.

"We're very much believers in the abilities of all peoples with disabilities," said Catherine Raggio, secretary of the Maryland Department of Disabilities.

Raggio started the program. It works as a staffing agency as part of PDG Inc. That is a company that helps people with disabilities. PDG hired Foley in November.

Sam Abed is a Maryland government official. He supports the program. He points to Foley's near-perfect work: In five months, he has made a single mistake. And that was when he just started.

"We have people who could do it but weren't doing as good a job as this young man is doing," Abed said.

Autism disorders affect people differently. The symptoms vary widely.

Shanna Pool is assistant principal of Kennedy Krieger Institute's special-education high school in Baltimore. She said tech jobs can be a good fit for people with autism or Asperger's.

"It's not necessary to read emotions when they're working on computers, or social cues," she said.

Julie Foley, Shane's mother, said her son took technology classes in school. He did data entry in a work-study program.

Frankie teamed up with a 17-year-old named Lauren Etherton. Lauren's brother has autism, too. He and Camille go to a special school. It is called the Kennedy Krieger School.

Ford's new center opened in January. It is just one example of the growing move of carmakers to California. Other auto companies with Valley offices include Toyota, Honda and BMW.

Airplane makers such as Boeing and Airbus are charging into a new world: They now are building wings and jet bodies out of carbon-fiber composites, rather than metal. This new lightweight material is made from a blend of carbon and plastic. Just like cloth, it is woven together.

Then, the head moves back and forth, laying down shorter and longer strips of fiber. Each strip is heated to a fiery glow. The surface to be covered rotates as needed.

As it zipped around, the machine reached an astounding top speed: 595 pounds of carbon fiber laid down per hour.

That is "a very large number, probably the fastest we've seen," said journalist Jeff Sloan. Typically, a speed of 90 pounds per hour would be fast, he said.

Bill Hasenjaeger works for CGTech, which developed the computer software used in AFP technology. He claims perfection is a more important than speed. If the new machine can do the work perfectly, he said, 595 pounds per hour is "a pretty darned impressive number."

Ben Hempstead is chief of staff at Electroimpact. He insists no one can match the company's AFP technology.

"You won't see this anywhere else on the planet," he said.

MEXICO CITY, Mexico — A tunnel-like passageway that could lead to the resting place of an Aztec ruler has been found in Mexico. The Aztecs were a powerful group of people in what is now Mexico and Central America.

The Aztecs ruled from 1325 to 1521. They are believed to have cremated, or burned, the remains of their leaders. However, the final resting place of the remains has never been found. Experts said the new passageway discovery could change that.

## Tunnel Offers Hint Of Ceremony

One expert found signs that a passageway appeared to lead deeper into a platform. The platform was known as the Cuauhxicalco (pronounced kwow-she-KAL-koh). It was used for ceremonies. Written reports showed that rulers' remains were burned there.  

It would make sense for rulers' remains to be kept there. Templo Mayor was the most significant place of prayer in the Aztecs' most important city, Tenochtitlan. Archaeologists have been searching for graves there for years.

In 2007, experts found underground rooms. They were located below a huge stone block carved with a picture of Tlaltecuhtli (tlahl-tay-KOO-tlee), the Aztec god of the earth. At the time, Lopez Lujan thought a ruler's resting place might lie beneath. Such a place was not found. 

Any artifacts linked to a ruler would bring great pride to Mexico. The country has tried to have some Aztec artifacts returned. Museums in other countries have some of them.

Moctezuma I, the second Aztec king, ruled from about 1440 to 1469. Moctezuma II came after him. He was the ruler who first fought against Hernan Cortes, the Spanish explorer. Cortes led the Spanish into Mexico. The Spanish conquered the Aztecs. Soon after, the Aztec Empire ended.
Keeva is a baby chimpanzee. She was born March 12 to a female chimp at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. Keeva had a problem. Her mom, Carole, did not seem to be ready for the hard job of being a mother.

In fact, some of the parents had not finished high school. Still, most had a smartphone and a tablet and used the Internet.

Many of the babies and toddlers may have been just playing with the screens. But their parents said at least some of them knew what they were doing.

About 1 in 6 children had used an app before they turned 1. And about 1 in 4 had called someone. The most common age to start using apps was 2. And more than one-third of the children started playing video games when they were 2.

## Some Screen Playtime

LOS ANGELES — Like his father and grandfather before him, Lou DeRosa is a butcher.

His shop at the Los Angeles Farmers Market is selling more bacon than ever. The price has gone "crazy," DeRosa said.

Bacon has become the country's most popular meat. Yet, a taste for bacon is becoming expensive. Since 2008, the price of bacon has risen more than three times faster than other goods. Bacon prices have gone up more than other types of meat, according to the government.

## The Drought Even Affected Bacon

But mainly, he said, Americans are hungry for bacon.

In June, shoppers paid $6.11 on average for a pound of sliced bacon in grocery stores. That price is a record high, according to the government. Four years earlier, people paid $4.05 a pound on average.

At a grocery store, James McMenamin checked the price of bacon.

Bacon prices are going up. Still, more people are buying it. In 2013, shoppers bought $4 billion worth of bacon. That amount set a record, according to Information Resources Inc. The company studies what people buy.

Bacon has a central place in America, said Ari Weinzweig. He is a bacon expert. He wrote "Zingerman's Guide to Better Bacon." People see it as a comfort food.

"It reminds us of childhood," he said.

## Chocolate Chip .. And Bacon?

Bacon can also be found in Denny's maple bacon milkshake.

SpenDifference is a restaurant supply company. It found that 93 percent of restaurants plan to raise prices.

"Baking saved my life," Feld said. "If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead."

EVANSTON, Ill. — Drew McDonough walks quickly past huge bags of brown sugar and tubs of chocolate frosting. He puts on his bakery clothes. Then he speed-walks toward his work table.

McDonough's boss at the bakery asked him about his weekend. He responded with short one-word answers. He barely looked her in the eye. That was fine with his boss, Jean Kroll. She owns the Sugar & Spice Extraordinary Sweet Treats bakery.

This past summer, McDonough and two other men with autism arrived at the bakery. They learned to measure sugar and package cakes. As they did, a student from Northwestern University carefully checked how much work they got done. The student wanted to figure out if it made good business sense to hire a worker with a disability like autism.

For Kroll, that was an important question.

The story of how she offered jobs to the three men with autism is one of luck and goodwill. It was also, according to Kroll, a good business decision.

People always tell Kroll "That's such a nice thing to do." Kroll answers them, "Yes it is nice, but it's also a smart thing to do."

## Helping Those With Autism Have Dreams

Voters in two states will decide if people will get to learn what is deep inside their food.

On Nov. 4, citizens in Oregon and Colorado will vote on whether companies must tell buyers, on the package, when food has been genetically changed in any way. The proposed laws call for labeling those foods.

## If Fans Don't Come "It's A Shame"

Twenty-six-year-old Devin Allen took pictures of the protests.

The cover photo is a shot of a single blurred figure running from a wall of police.

At first he took pictures of peaceful protests. Then, he says, things got more dangerous after some fans leaving a baseball game started yelling hateful things at the protesters.

The people of Baltimore were not just angry about Freddie Gray. Allen says things have been bad for a long time between police and black people in the inner city.

There are lots of other cities like Baltimore. Allen thinks people outside the inner cities might not understand the problems between people of different races. By capturing it in a photo, he says he can offer them a glimpse into why riots happen.

"My pictures are supposed to keep you aware," he says. "To make you think. To make you feel."
BALTIMORE, Md. — Violent protests broke out in Baltimore Monday after a black man died in police custody.

## New U.S. Official Wants Peace For City

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch condemned the violence. Lynch is the first black woman to serve as the country's top law enforcement officer.

Lynch said that people who commit violence to protest Gray's death are hurting Gray's family. They also are being unfair to the "peaceful protesters who are working to improve their community for all its residents," she said.
Nature is full of thieves. Robber bees raid the hives of other bees and steal their honey. Some ants capture and enslave members of neighboring colonies. Large frigate birds swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish right out of their beaks.

DHAKA, Bangladesh — Mukhta Mollah smooths the red material and pushes it through a sewing machine. She is in Bangladesh, an Asian country next to India, making women's shirts that will be sent to America. She works six days a week in this hot and sweaty factory. Each workday is eight hours or more.

More than 350 seamstresses, women sewing clothes, sit in rows in this huge factory. Bright lights buzz and blink overhead. Huge loud fans push around the hot air, which smells like new clothes.

It takes Mollah less than 30 seconds to complete her part of the shirt. A helper piles the shirts into a bin to take to the next station. Mollah has gotten used to the hard factory work.

In the book, Barbie is helping to create a video game.

Parents are helping to make STEM dolls popular, says Jackie Breyer. She writes for the magazine Toy Insider. Breyer said that STEM dolls are selling well.

For example, K'nex now sells a construction kit with two female dolls. In the kit, the dolls get to build their dream house. 

Last summer, Purdue University announced results from a study. It found that engineering and building toys are purchased for boys twice as often as girls.

Timeless Toys in Chicago sells Lottie and GoldieBlox toys. Scott Friedland is in charge at Timeless Toys. He said that the dolls encourage girls to learn about STEM subjects. He also said the dolls are popular because they give a positive view of girls' bodies.

For the third time in 10 years, the Red Sox paraded the prize through their city in a "rolling rally." The team rode in amphibian-like vessels called "duck boats." Thousands of fans lined the streets and the waterway to watch them go by.

The most emotional moment happened early in Saturday's trip. The vehicles stopped at the Boston Marathon finish line. The spot was near where two explosions killed three people watching the race on April 15.

"That was an emotional moment," Gomes said. "To bring the World Series trophy to the finish line, I don't think that the story was written that way, but I was glad to be a part of it."

The Red Sox had left Boston to go on a road trip the day of the Marathon. On the way to the airport, they saw emergency vehicles responding to the explosions. Team Manager John Farrell recalled that moment.

"That's going to bring back a lot, and a lot of uncertainty at that moment," Farrell said, "because no one knew where to turn next."

## From Worst To First

Then the team got on board 25 duck boats normally used for tourist trips. They come in pink, yellow, lime green, white and other colors.

Some boats even had brown carpeting cut into the shape of beards attached on the front.

Dungan is slow to speak and express herself. It's been a challenge for her. Kids like her are said to have special needs.

Officials agreed with combining mentoring and athletics to make things better at the schools, he said. It was a perfect mix of what they wanted to do for students, he said.

He suggested the idea of creating a sixth-grade basketball league to Angela Harper. She is the principal at Crouse school. She passed the idea along to Rambler and others in charge of student behavior, programs and athletics.

Dennis came up with a plan. It helps the mentors teach the boys to be responsible for their actions. The boys learn to show anger in other ways, to understand and respect others and to be proud of who they are. Doing these things frees them from the situations that keep many poor young people from achieving their dreams.

The health agency provides training and support to children and adults. It works in churches, schools and homes in the community.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — New Jersey has so few little brown bats that there may soon be no more left. At the same time, the number of another species, big brown bats, is growing. The reason behind both is a disease called "white nose syndrome."

B.B. King, the famous blues guitarist and singer, has died. He was 89.

NEW YORK — It's been a big news year for bears, especially in Maine. Voters there face a question on Nov. 4 that has troubled other states with large numbers of bears. Maine wants to keep its bear population low. Yet at the same time animal rights groups are trying to outlaw certain hunting methods that would help it do just that.

Voters are being asked whether these methods should be banned. With a ban in place, they would only be allowed in cases of protecting property, public safety, or for research.

Also on the "no" side fighting the ban are the National Rifle Association, labor unions and Governor Paul LePage. They face a large amount of money being spent by the Humane Society, the ASPCA and other animal rights groups to promote the ban.

People against the ban would seem to have recent news on their side. Incidents have occurred in states with big bear numbers. The most well-known of these happened last month in New Jersey, where a 22-year-old hiker was attacked and killed by a black bear.

Officials killed the bear. A police report described it as a large male weighing 250-300 pounds.

Also last month, a Santa Barbara County, California, woman fought off a black bear. It attacked her while she was out walking her dogs.

But the Maine debate highlights a national problem: Black bear populations have increased, thanks to conservation efforts to protect the species. At the same time, there have been more encounters between bears and humans in many areas.

In Ridgewood, New Jersey, police last month captured a black bear wandering near an elementary school. Wildlife officials there say reports of bear sightings have increased 23 percent over last year. The bear in Ridgewood had climbed a tree and was shot with a tranquilizer gun. It was released back into the wild.

The latest surveys show the "no" side that is fighting the ban is ahead in Maine by a few percentage points. However, the "yes" side is still hopeful.
ORLANDO, Fla. — Until last week, people used to look at Florida black bears with wonder and fun.

Sure, more people were complaining. But the big lugs kept appearing in Central Florida communities. And that made for fun Facebook posts and interesting talk.

No one had been badly hurt yet because of a bear. State wildlife experts told people that the beasts would leave them alone, if people just followed some rules.

All of that changed on Dec. 2. Susan Chalfant, 54, was walking her two small dogs when she was badly hurt by a bear.  It was the most serious bear attack in Florida's history.

David Simmons is in Florida's government. His district has had the most bear problems in Florida during the past five years. He said wildlife officials need to think about dealing with the bears in a different way.

He said that neighborhoods reporting problems with bears have been around a long time. They're not new ones that went up where bears lived.

LOS GATOS, Calif. — Three years of drought have dried up California's rivers and streams.

## Beavers Are Helpers

The agricultural businesses are very interested in finding a solution. American crops are worth $20 billion, and the crops depend on bees.

"I know, definitively, that there's a relationship between treated seed and spring die-offs," said Krupke. He said the chemical lands on dandelions and even on the bees themselves.

LOS ANGELES — A previously unknown reason for the rapid dying off of honeybee colonies has been discovered: A deadly virus has spread from plants to the bees.

Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) is a pathogen — a micro-organism that causes disease. It is spread by pollen and is known to damage soy crops. It was previously only found in plants. But now, a new study reports, it has been discovered in honeybees.

## Maybe We Should Replace Beef

DELEON SPRINGS, Fla. — The pregnant cow nosed around rancher David Strawn's pickup truck. She was hoping to find something good to eat.

Supporters of grass-fed meat like it for several reasons. They say it has less fat and is healthier than traditional meat. They also say it is better for the environment and is kinder to the animals.

WASHINGTON — Texas cattleman Bob McCan wants nothing to do with the U.S. government's latest meat-labeling rules.

Letting shoppers know what country their meat comes from is something a lot of people say that they want.

"We don't want beef to become a luxury item," said McCan, a fifth-generation rancher.

Sara Zhang is like many people who live in Beijing. She has done things at home to protect herself from pollution. She has also taken steps to protect her two children. Yet her 7-year-old son's public school has not installed any air purifiers. The students in her son's school have to breathe the dirty air.

## Pollution Is Making People Sick

BEIJING, China — Many people in this city took a vacation from the smog on Tuesday. They wanted to be somewhere else as the Chinese capital launched its first red alert for pollution. Schools closed, factories stopped their work and half of the cars were kept off the streets. 

This was the first time pollution has triggered a red alert. An alert is announced when weather forecasters think there will be heavy pollution for 72 hours straight.

Dangerous smog has continued here even though the Chinese government has promised to clean it up. Smog is a mixture of pollution and fog. It comes from years of fast growth. China has been building new cities and factories at great speed. Most of the smog is blamed on power plants that use coal. Cars, construction and factory work are also to blame.  

From Tuesday through Thursday, schools were closed. Some people grumbled about the closings. A few non-Chinese schools sought permission to reopen Wednesday.

The day the new laws were announced, the city put up giant "Stop Smoking" banners. It also encouraged people to use a complicated set of hand signals to tell others to stop smoking.

ATLANTA, Ga. — The Georgia Aquarium cannot bring in 18 beluga whales from Russia.

TACOMA, Wash. — Ever since Mount St. Helens erupted 34 years ago this month, scientists have been tracking the volcano's explosive energy. The goal: to better understand how Washington's most active volcano works.

Scientists are preparing to set off explosions in two dozen wells. The 80-foot deep holes have been drilled around the mountain. Volunteers traveling by car, on foot and on horseback will place thousands of small seismometers near the mountain. They'll record the seismic energy of the explosions.

The goal is to better understand how molten rock, or magma, makes its way to St. Helens' crater. Some 60 miles beneath the surface tectonic plates shift. It's also where magma is created. Sometimes the plates collide and cause earthquakes. If an earthquake happens below a volcano, magma can bubble up from underground.

## The iMUSH Experiments

## When Magma Moves

Finding answers is important, scientists say. They hope it will enable them to better understand when magma is moving. That knowledge, they say, will help them predict eruptions at other volcanoes around the world. It might save thousands of lives.

"By throwing multiple things at this, we'll have a better sense of the whole," he said.

Malone and other scientists are designing 70 seismic stations. They would be installed up to 30 miles from the mountain to measure natural seismicity.

But in the days since Bergdahl's release Saturday, a different story has emerged. In this version, the 28-year-old soldier from Idaho is not a hero but a deserter.

Early reports of his capture suggested that Bergdahl was taken prisoner while he was out on patrol. But several soldiers who were stationed with Bergdahl say he walked away from his unit. They are demanding that Bergdahl be punished for what they consider to be his decision to abandon his post. He risked the lives of soldiers who went looking for him, they say.

Another former soldier, Evan Buetow, said Bergdahl had talked about "walking across the mountains on his own" or walking to India. They thought he was joking, Buetow said.

Army officials have said they will be talking with Bergdahl. They expect to be able to figure out what happened.

In the wake of Bergdahl's release, critics have accused President Barack Obama of caving in to Taliban demands. They say from now on there will be a higher price to bring back any future U.S. servicemen and women captured by the Taliban. They also complain he didn't give Congress enough notice of the deal.

Biden went later to the Great Hall of the People. It is a ceremonial building steps away from Tiananmen Square. Any problems between the United States and China were ignored. Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao welcomed him with an elaborate honor guard. A military band played the two countries' national anthems as Biden and Xi stood in the huge hall, which had marble floors and crisscrossing red carpets.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140428_BIGHORN_SHEEP.jpg" />FRESNO, Calif. — Fifteen years ago, things were looking bad for the Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. There were just 105 of them scattered across the mountain range from which they take their name.

And just last month, 14 sheep were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, located high in the mountains in Sequoia National Park. Nine of the sheep were pregnant.

Coming back from near extinction is known as _recovery_.

## "To See Success"

A lot goes into walking. It takes balance, strength and brainpower. Just ask Zac Vawter. He lost his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009. But with the help of a team of scientists and doctors, he has taught a whole new type of artificial leg to walk, kick and do everything else that a leg does.

The team includes scientists who develop software, surgeons, and people who make artificial limbs called prosthetics. Together they designed a leg that can receive commands directly from Vawter's brain.

The leg has learned to read what Vawter wants it to do. A bundle of nerves that end above his missing knee gives signals to the leg, a scientific report said.

Roughly 1 million Americans  have lost a leg or part of one. Vawter and his robotic leg offer hope that future prosthetics might feel more natural.

The leg weighs just over 10 pounds. It has two separate engines. One powers movement in the ankle and the other in the knee. It has sensors that are capable of detecting and measuring movement all over.

In most prosthetics, the wearer has to turn a key to change from one type of movement to another. Not so in Vawter's robotic leg.

## Rewiring The Severed Nerves

A 20-year-old woman in Taiwan has become the first patient to have a certain type of bird flu. It's known as H6N1.

Viruses are infections that attack the cells in the body. The flu is a virus.

These naturally talented fliers can reach great heights. One goose flew more than 4 miles high for a short while. But it was not clear to scientists exactly how high the birds could fly or how they stayed at such heights. Many researchers figured the geese would fly to the top of the mountains and stay there. They thought the birds would not waste energy flying down and back up again.

To find out, scientists needed to watch the birds in the air. They attached tools to the geese that would measure body temperature, speed and heartbeat.

The scientists found that birds did not fly in a straight line. Instead, the geese would climb to get over a high peak and drop when the ground leveled out. This meant doing extra work to keep flying over the mountains, over and over again.

It seemed like a lot of extra flying to climb very little. But the study found it to be the best way to travel. If the birds had gone up in a straight line, they would have spent more energy making the trip.

That is probably because flying at great heights can be very tiring. The birds have to flap their wings more because the mountain air is thinner. Their wings have less air to push against. They have to work harder to keep moving.

The herd had been smaller because they were hunted. Then, several years ago, the animals wandered into Grand Canyon National Park. They cannot be hunted there.

Diane Chalfant, a park official, says the animals know they're safe in the park.

It will take close to two years of study and public input to develop a final plan. Park officials want to get the bison out of the national park and on to state lands. The animals can be hunted there.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — Evan Neal is definitely not your average 16-year-old. For one thing, he gives his father a few hundred dollars each month to cover the electricity cost of running his energy-hungry computer equipment.

It's all part of the latest business launched by the tech-savvy high school junior. Evan uses his powerful computer to get bitcoins. Bitcoin is a paperless and coin-less money that is earned and spent over the Internet. Bitcoin miners — as people like Evan are called — earn bitcoins by using special computer software to solve complicated math problems.

It's an experience that's making him money. Evan figures he has made more than $2,000 in profits. His costs are heavy, though, and include buying special computer equipment and giving $200 to $300 to his dad for the electric bill each month.

## The Search Is Difficult

## Ironwork Created By Slaves

Some large objects already have been put in place, and the building will be built around them.

One of them is a railroad car with different sections for whites in the front and a sign for "colored" in the back. African-American were called "colored" during the years of slavery and segregation. The railroad car is an example of how segregation laws separated blacks and whites in public places.

Visitors will be able to walk through the Southern Railway car, used from 1940 to 1960. Comfortable seating for whites are up in the front. A divider kept African-Americans in the plain seating in the back.

The rail car is one of the physical reminders from America's long years of segregation, and those objects are rare, said Peter Claussen. He works for Gulf &amp; Ohio Railways, which gave the rail car to the museum. "The separate water fountains are gone. The black and white sections of movie theaters are gone. There are very few objects that allow people to see what segregation was like, and this is one of them."

Bunch began planning the museum in 2005 with just two staff members and no museum objects. Now, his longed-for goal is within reach.

Time magazine and The New York Times noted the breakthrough. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt greeted the reporter as he made his way over to the president's desk, telling him, "Glad to see you, McAlpin."

That friendliness was not shown by McAlpin's fellow reporters. They were members of the White House Correspondents' Association, or WHCA. For 10 years, that group had denied black reporters the opportunity to attend the twice-weekly news conferences in the Oval Office.

## A Son's Hero

The price of a single camera ranges from less than $100 to more than $1,000. In addition to buying the cameras, departments also must pay for storing the videos.

In New Jersey, a law passed last fall requires some officers to wear cameras. If they do not wear them, then patrol cars that are used during traffic stops must have a camera on the dashboard.

The law only applies to new vehicles. Police officers who spend most of their time at a desk doing work, or who do not regularly conduct traffic stops do not need to wear a camera.

BOGOTA, Colombia — This tough city of 7.6 million rarely gets respect. It often ranks near the bottom in surveys of cities that are pleasant to live in. People call it one of the ugliest capitals in the Western world.

However, in recent years, it has been getting an accidental makeover. Weak laws and blank walls have made it a haven for graffiti artists.

Now, this capital city seems to be in bloom. Everything from high-art to hurried scrawls spring from overpasses, storefronts and sidewalks. The splash of color is earning the city praise in the art world. Still, some here wonder about the line between art and vandalism.

The city was already becoming a hotbed for graffiti. Then last year, the mayor rolled out a law to regulate the practice. Now, graffiti is allowed everywhere except landmarks, government buildings and public infrastructure, like bridges. Artists need permission before tagging their names on private property. But while fines and punishments do exist, some say the new rules have given graffiti the stamp of approval.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — Even before he started school, Jason Borders tended to collect unusual objects. Among them were animal bones. He found them while exploring his neighborhood, the Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, Ky.

He always had a little cabinet of weird things in his room, and in the garage, Borders remembers.

Years later, Borders still is collecting bones and other curiosities. These days, though, Borders covers them with his own detailed designs. They hang in art galleries, where they sell for hundreds and thousands of dollars each.

Borders now lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, Elizabeth. He was back in Lexington this month to show his work at a downtown shop.

The pieces are animal bones, mostly skulls. Into each Borders has engraved and inked complicated designs of lines and dots. They look like the patterns found in traditional tattoos from India and the Middle East.

"I picked it up and started working on" the bones, Borders says.

The same Borders style is visible in the bones, his paintings and his other work.

## Hearing From Kids

## Books About Other Games

WASHINGTON – Every day, 80 to 120 children cross the Texas border illegally. They do it by themselves.

Almost two-thirds of these children from 2008 to 2010 were finally placed with sponsors living in the United States. The ideal sponsor is a family member. But some go to licensed programs willing to accept legal responsibility of a child, such as shelters for homeless youth.

Advocates worry the government is not paying enough attention to the sponsors because of the extra cases. They need to make sure that the family members or friends can take care of the children and that the home is suitable. Some worry that many children are being released to people who claim to be the parents but are not.

Weyant's music is low-tech. He's turned a tin can into a microphone. He presses it against the fence. Wires attached to the tin lead to an amp to make the sound louder.

"Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people," he said.

From 2004 to 2010, the federal government hired a youth jail center in Vincennes, Indiana, to hold immigrant children. It was supposed to house the most dangerous children.

I run the Immigration Clinic of Indiana University's law school. I went to Vincennes with volunteer law school students. We went to provide legal help to these kids.

Not every child should be allowed to stay. But turning children away at gunpoint goes against our laws and our history. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, allowed to stay when appropriate, and sent back home safely as necessary.

The crisis has been made worse by talk in Washington that immigrants here illegally would be allowed to stay here. The talk started in 2012 when Obama decided to stop deporting youth with close ties to the United States. Then news spread that young children arriving at the border were being released until their hearings. It increased the rumors that immigrants would be allowed to stay.

A new study of students in Germany reveals that there are five different types of boredom. That's one more than researchers had expected.

The newly discovered type is called "apathetic boredom." Apparently, it's quite common among high school students.

And boredom isn't just boring. It can be dangerous too — either for the person who is bored, or for the people around him or her. For instance, people who are bored are more likely to smoke, drink or use drugs. Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and get into trouble with the police. Boredom can also lead to health problems.

MOUNT IDA, Ark. — Fewer college students are studying plant life, or botany, these days. Several universities are also closing their plant collections, which are called herbaria. This could become a problem, as fewer people will know things about plants in the future.

Only half the number of colleges offer botany degrees now compared with the number that offered them in 1988, says the National Science Foundation. Meanwhile, the government said fewer than 400 students received botany degrees in 2012. Educators say that's because students are being pushed to study technology subjects instead.

People who are experts in plants are called botanists. The botanists working today worry that there won't be enough botanists in the future. They believe this will hurt efforts to protect nature. It could even make it harder to develop important medicines which come from plants. At the same time, universities and states are closing their plant collections. They are doing this to save money. The collections of plants are sometimes expensive to keep.

An example of what botanists do happened recently in a clearing on the side of a highway in Arkansas. It is known as a glade. Scientists were looking for a threatened plant in the glade. It is called the Missouri bladderpod. The plant has small yellow flowers. There are only 75 groups of the plant in the world. All the groups are close enough to cities to be in danger, said botanist Theo Witsell. He works for the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission.

Most frustrating of all, the more effort and thought we put into it, the harder it may become. Now neuroscientists might have found a clue about why it is so difficult to force that creative spark.

Scientists at Stanford University recently set out to explore creativity in the brain. They came up with surprising findings. Their study suggests that the cerebellum, the brain region that controls muscles and movement, is also involved in creativity. If so, the discovery could change our understanding of the way the brain works.

Starting in 2016, Churchill's face will appear on the back of what is probably Britain's most widely used bill. The note is worth about $7.50.

True, Queen Elizabeth II's smiling face is on all of Britain's money. But that's because she is Queen. It has nothing to do with anything she achieved on her own.

Criado-Perez is a journalist. She has launched a campaign to get at least some women on British currency. She says such fairness is required by law. More than 30,000 people have signed her online petition so far. Dozens of female members of Parliament support her movement.

The selection process is a secret. The bank lists "broad name recognition" as a requirement for those it picks. But probably not one British person in a thousand could tell you who Matthew Boulton was.  (He was an 18th Century engineer). Not one in 10,000 could identify John Houblon. (He was the Bank of England's first governor). Both men have adorned the 50-pound note.

For that matter, few people could probably identify Elizabeth Fry, the woman currently featured on the fiver. Even Criado-Perez confesses to knowing little about her or her work in prison reform.

But there are plenty of other women who have made important contributions to history and deserve a spot on a bank note, activists say. One frequently mentioned is Rosalind Franklin. She is a scientist who played a key role in the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. But the Nobel Prize went to men she worked with: James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins.

The Bank of England shouldn't take part in the same sour sexism, said Criado-Perez. She said she would be delighted if Jane Austen were the next woman chosen.
## Will The Queen Have To Move?

## Billions For Repairs

Exam boards in England and Wales set school syllabuses in line with government rules. On Friday, they finished releasing their new book lists for the English Literature GCSE. GCSEs are exams taken by 16-year-olds after a two-year course of study.

John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" and Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird" are no longer on the lists. Neither is Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible." African and Asian writers including Haruki Murakami and Chinua Achebe have also been dropped.

But debate on the changes has mostly been about the loss of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Of Mice and Men." Several generations of Britons remember those two books from their school days.

Few commentators had anything bad to say about "To Kill A Mockingbird," Harper Lee's book about a girl learning about racism and justice in the American South. Outraged fans of the book even got the hashtag "#Mockingbird" trending on Twitter after Gove's changes were announced.

"It's true ... 'Of Mice and Men' is set just because it's short, but it is nonetheless a marvelous book for teaching," Carey said. "It's a wonderful book, deeply human." And reading "To Kill A Mockingbird, he said, can change the way you think.

## One Of The Best Moments Of Her Life

"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments," the president said. These revolve around issues of "race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government." But, he said, "the urgency of the situation requires us to move past some of those old arguments and focus on getting something done and focusing on what works. Doesn't mean the arguments are unimportant; it just means that they can't paralyze us."

The new program was shaped in part by two meetings Obama had with the Chicago group Becoming a Man. Those meetings left a deep impression on both the president and the group's young African-American men. The last time they saw the president, they presented him with a Father's Day card in the Oval Office. The gesture left him speechless.

Around that time, Obama directed his staff to start looking at how to help African-American boys. He asked them to come up with approaches that didn't involve any grand new federal programs.

The result is a public-private partnership. Its mission is to make the best use of existing government moneys and to get the most out of support from businesses and private groups.

## Testing The Building's Age

The deadline for a deal to keep paying for the government is midnight Monday. Otherwise, a wide range of programs would be affected, from national parks to the Pentagon.

The Republicans run the House. It approved a new plan on Sunday. The plan would have delayed a key part of the new health care law by a year. It also would have gotten rid of a tax on medical devices. In return, a shutdown would have been avoided.

The House's vote was 231-192. Almost everybody voted with their political party. Now the action moves to the Senate.

The Senate was not scheduled to meet until midafternoon Monday. There will be just 10 hours before a shutdown would begin. Even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage as the deadline approached.

















A few days ago, Chartier offered a class to about 45 basketball fans. They paid up to $100 each to learn how to pick the winners.

Chartier's son decided he could live with that.

Del Castillo, 18, sweeps a magenta cape. His chest is thrust forward, his lips are puckered and his mouth bulges. He ends the pass with one leg fully extended behind him. The other leg is firmly planted below. After the imaginary bull passes, Del Castillo lifts his eyes and takes a few triumphant strides.

His teacher for the past six weeks has been Gonzalo Rincon. He is the father of legendary Colombian bullfighter Cesar Rincon.

In Colombia, most teenagers play Xbox or soccer. They chase girls, not bulls. Bullfighting used to be a big part of yearly celebrations. Today, the Spanish colonial tradition is disappearing. Things are changing and bullfighting faces sometimes violent protests. The sport does not do well as a business, either.

"I think this is the lowest moment in the tradition," Cesar Rincon said. He is a bull rancher in retirement who lives in Madrid with his father. He spends four months of the year in Colombia. About a dozen bull ranches across the country have gone out of business in the last 10 years as fewer places host fights.

Ticket prices are too high for most Colombians. A lower-level seat in Medellin costs an entire month's salary for a low-paid worker. Benjamin de Los Rios runs Medellin's Plaza de la Macarena. He says international bullfighters that draw crowds get paid up to $140,000 per afternoon. The result is a half-empty arena and fewer parents passing on the tradition to their children.

## Protest At La Macarena

"We have to teach our roots, the backbone of our tradition," he said.

In recent years, people who oppose bullfighting appeared to be winning. "Politicians have realized that they can win votes by saying they are against bullfighting," said Colombian bullfighter Manuel Libardo. He was voted Colombia's best bullfighter this year. He believes Colombia's bullfighting future is uncertain.

## Plaza De Toros Closed

Last year, the group decided it would not hold bullfights in Quito until the law is changed and the tradition is restored. A bullring was set up outside the city limits. The group is looking forward to a change this year.
Scientists Robert Faris of the University of California at Davis and Diane Felmlee of Penn State University created the study. They found that older views of bullying don't tell the whole story. For most students, gains in popularity "increase the likelihood of victimization," they wrote in the magazine of the American Sociological Association. As kids move up the social ladder, the victimization becomes more severe.

## Seeking Some Sort Of Shield

Nathaniel, 49, is also a pastor. He leads two Minneapolis churches. He was in his second year as a school bus driver for Durham School Services. It's the bus company that employed him.

After someone from the school district complained about the prayer, Durham gave Nathaniel a warning, he said. It then assigned him bus routes at two different schools.

The warning didn't stop Nathaniel. "I let them know I am a pastor and I am going to pray," Nathaniel said.

Lawyer Marshall Tanick agrees. Nathaniel has the right to express his views, he said, as long as they aren't forced upon others.

But Nikki Williams, whose three children also go to the same school, feels differently. "It wouldn't bother me at all," she said, if a bus driver prayed with students.

Nathaniel said he talked to parents as he saw them at bus stops. He let them know he was a pastor and asked if it would be OK for him to pray with the kids on the bus. "The parents I talked with, they were in agreement that I was doing fine."

Nathaniel said he had driven school buses in Wisconsin and Georgia before coming to Minnesota. On those routes, he had always prayed with the kids.

A lot of high school seniors cruise to the end of school by springtime. Maceo Rucker-Shivers cannot afford to join them.

His class work at Olympic High School in Charlotte, N.C., and his after-school job at nearby Bosch Rexroth Corp., are preparing him to work with machines. His bosses watch to see whether his skills and dedication make it worth paying for him to go to community college.

The future of public education may look a lot like what Rucker-Shivers is doing now.

## Forging Closer Links

Charlotte is putting aside money to launch new schools focused on internships and career skills. Olympic got a head start when it split into five career-themed mini-schools in 2006. Business partnerships, career exploration and real-life projects were a big part of the new approach.

The usual testing and memorization will not help students in the real world, said career development coordinator Michael Realon. He used to work for business groups and now puts Olympic High in touch with businesses.

## "eHarmony" Of Job Matching

Rucker-Shivers recently got good news about his own economic future. His hard work paid off: He got an apprenticeship with Bosch.
SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash. — Once a month collectors gather at Spokane Valley Sportscards. They break open sealed boxes of cards, looking for what they call a hit. They're all after players with big names. They want the ones whose cards are worth hundreds of dollars.

Joseph Branda is one of the regulars. He's known for taking risks.

He once bought a $600 box of basketball cards. He has a collection that could be worth as much as a car. On this Saturday, as the others hold back their spending, he asked for another box of football cards, spending $140 on it.

Leaning over a counter, Branda, 22, quickly sorts through the box. He rips open six packs and flips through a lineup of football players.

It's a hit. He's scored Robert Griffin III, the starting quarterback for the Washington football team. The card is autographed. It also has a piece of his jersey attached to it.

All conversation in the room stops, and several of the others huddle around him. They stare at the card.

The regulars who come to Bisson's shop are not interested, however, in making trades.

His love of cards (or addiction, depending on how you look at it) is what drew him into this business. Twenty years ago, he got into the business with a salesman at a card shop.

Bisson's the only one still left, running the store from an old house.

In what was once a cozy living room, racks of card boxes block the windows. The fireplace is hidden behind shelves of cards.

On good days, maybe a dozen people walk in, but there are many days, though, when it's just Bisson.

## Many Outgrow Card Collecting ...

"That's the respect that we give each other," said Miranda. He is a 50-year-old who lives in Woodland Park, N.J. "They call me by saying, 'Hey, master sergeant.'"

LOS ANGELES — Feel bad for the common Mormon swallowtail butterfly male. His possible female mates can come in four different color patterns. But only one of those patterns looks familiar. The rest look a lot like other butterflies, and poisonous ones at that.

Other broad questions remain. "If mimicry is helping these females survive, why on Earth aren't the males getting the same advantage?" Kronforst said. "We simply do not understand the answer to that question."

He believes that what is called "counterbalancing selection" may be at play. Sometimes if a harmful characteristic is paired with a helpful one, both are kept.

BALTIMORE — California Chrome has won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. Those are the first two "jewels" — or races — in horse racing's Triple Crown. Now he just has the June 7 Belmont Stakes ahead of him in his bid to become horse racing's 12th Triple Crown winner.

The 5,000 inhabitants of this former lumber town in Mendocino County are now on a water diet. A family of four gets a ration of no more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent.

California was already parched from last year's dry weather. Now as the winter progresses, concern is growing. It appears California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s. Or, even worse, the drought of 1977.

## Too Much Sun

THREE RIVERS, Calif. — People love black bears in this woodsy California town. When tourists stop on their way to the nearby national parks, their first question is: "Where can I see a bear?"

Town shop owner Cindy Skeen said she often sees black bears around her house. She thinks they are more playful than dangerous.

The train is not expected to be running full-time until 2028. At that point, the prices will be set with the help of a private company, said Jeff Morales. He is in charge of the California High-Speed Rail Authority. The group is planning the train project and it will run the bullet train when it's done.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Sitting in a dirty bar down a back alley in the Cambodian capital, Ros Choun struggled to explain how he ended up here.

Despite his Cambodian looks, Choun had spent almost his entire life in the United States. In fact, at 35, he doesn't think of himself as anything but American. His family sought safety in America in the early 1980s after fleeing their homeland. A civil war and mass killings left Cambodia in ruins and almost 2 million people dead.

"I was 6 months old when I left this country," he said. His voice was filled with anger. "I'm American — but no one told us if we go to prison we could get deported back to Cambodia."

A new study suggests that it may have expanded their minds.

Humans first learned to control fire about 400,000 years ago. The quality of their lives changed dramatically, a researcher believes. Brain size and stomach size increased, and predators became much less of a threat. Firelight also extended the day by several hours, according to the study.

## Telling Stories At Night

That's the message posted on the Facebook page of San Jose Family Camp. The camp near Yosemite National Park was partly burned by fire last summer. But it will be ready for campers when it opens Friday.

"It's like your home burning down," said Scott Gelfand. Gelfand, who is 55, has gone to Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp each summer for 29 years. He worked there over the summer. And he had been bringing his family ever since. "The memories are so deep and so important and so loving and so family- and community-oriented, I think most people are still in shock."

Two of its citizens were successful in carrying out two big attacks. Both of the attackers were being watched by the government as safety risks.

On a chilly, cloudy day, the war memorial was full of people. They brought flowers, notes or just their thoughts as the capital struggled to deal with the apparent act of terror.

Inside the dome, workers installed a puffy cloth just below the ceiling. It has a hole in the middle that lets visitors see the painting on the inside of the dome from the rotunda.

LOS ANGELES — The historic record label, Capitol Records, hired a new boss in 2012. When he arrived, the award-winning records hanging on the wall were taken down. A cardboard cutout of the Beatles was hauled away.

A big part of Capitol's improvement has been Barnett's ability to choose the artists and anticipate which ones could become big stars. In 2014, Capitol hired two of the biggest new artists of the year: singer Sam Smith and the boy band 5 Seconds of Summer.

Other aquariums are less eager to change.

PITTSBURGH — The Carnegie Science Center (CSC) sees itself as a leader in science education for girls. Over the years, the museum has organized science sleepovers and visits with scientists for tweens and teens. Its website, CanTEEN, gets girls interested in science through contests, exhibits and workshops.

It was pretty surprised when people began attacking a program for Girl Scouts. The class is called "Science With a Sparkle." It teaches girls how to mix their own makeup.

Linda Ortenzo runs STEM programs at the Science Center.

Heather Arnet runs the Women &amp; Girls Foundation of Western Pennsylvania. Arnett has worked with the Science Center for years on programs for girls. She was surprised that people were so upset with the museum.

She also said some good will come out of this.

"What I think was really great was the parent response all over social media," she said. Parents talked about the need for girls to have good STEM classes and be involved in science.

ATLANTA, Ga. — Former President Jimmy Carter has cancer. Doctors are trying to decide the best way to treat it.

Carter's statement did not say where the cancer began. The liver is often a place where cancer spreads to. It is less commonly where it begins.

Dr. Lodovico Balducci specializes in treating cancer in the elderly at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida. Balducci said a lot depends on the patient's "biological" age as opposed to his age in years.

Jimmy Carter's body probably works better than the typical 90-year-old, Balducci said.

Since his presidency, Carter has been very active. In May, he was forced to leave Guyana in South America, where he went to observe elections, after he came down with a bad cold.

Carter traveled around the country this summer to talk about his new book. Its title is "A Full Life." In the book, he says that his father, brother and two sisters all died of cancer.

Carter does not smoke. He wrote that "may have been what led to my longer life."

For cartoonists, causing anger is part of the job. Political cartoonists use a powerful set of tools to argue their points. The cartoonists caricature people, drawing them to look ridiculous. They make fun of opponents, and insult them. They exaggerate issues, showing them in black and white, literally.

NEW YORK — They speak different languages. They live in rich countries and poor ones, with good job markets and bad. But when it comes to money, they all are acting the same. Families are keeping a tight grip on their cash, driven more by a fear of losing what they have than a desire to get more.

It has been more than five years since the global economic crisis hit. Families around the world still are too nervous to take any chances with their money.

Slow economic growth means salaries in the United States will rise slowly. Right now, unemployment in parts of Europe is at a record high. In several countries, more than 35 percent of young people are out of work.

High unemployment in many countries means fewer people have extra money to spend. But even people with stable jobs are being careful.

The Associated Press analyzed information about what people did with their money five years before the crisis began and five years after. They focused on the world's 10 richest countries. They are: the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Russia, Italy and India.

Given their experience, people are slow to begin borrowing again, says Jack Ablin. He is an officer with BMO Private Bank in Chicago.

The test included 20 house cats from 14 homes. The animals were tested in their own homes. This was done so that the nervousness cats feel in new places wouldn't affect the tests.

## Ignoring Strangers

LOS ANGELES — The bones of a previously unknown type of ancient leopard are shaking up old ideas. They suggest that big cats first arose in Asia, not Africa.

Paleontologists, scientists who study ancient bones and other remains known as fossils, discovered the previously unknown species in Tibet in 2010. The newly found leopard is related to the modern snow leopard. The fossils from seven of the cats range in age from 4.1 million to 5.9 million years old. That makes these big cats as much as 2 million years older than any previously known ones.

Panthera blytheae was slightly smaller than today's snow leopard. It probably roamed the Tibetan mountains for several million years. There it dined on antelope, pika and blue sheep, according to paleontologist Zhijie Jack Tseng.

## Separate Branch Of Big Cats

Scientists in China have found the first clear evidence of cats living among humans. Their discovery shows the relationship goes back 5,300 years.

The evidence was published Monday. It supports the view that cats began living with people once humans started farming. Dogs had already been tamed thousands of years before by hunters.

The discovery fills in an enormous gap in experts' understanding of how cats became pets. But, it has also confused them. An ancient Chinese village is the last place scientists expected to find such evidence.

"This was a very unexpected find," said Fiona Marshall. She helped write the study. She's a scientist at Washington University in St. Louis.

## The Cave Has A History

The Lehman Cave in Nevada is part of Great Basin National Park. The park lies between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Absalom Lehman was a miner who found the cave in 1885. But many believe Native Americans used it ages before that.

The cave is 2 miles long and 200 feet below ground at its lowest point. It became a national monument in 1922.

TEL AVIV, Israel — If you thought recycling was modern habit — think again.

Our prehistoric ancestors learned to recycle thousands of years ago. They recycled the objects they used in their daily lives. Researchers presented the evidence at a conference in Tel Aviv.

It's the first time researchers have shown how cavemen recycled, said Ran Barkai. He's an archeologist who helped organize the conference. Like other archeologists, Barkai studies the history of humankind through objects he finds in the ground.

Early humans collected broken tools made of flint and bone, Barkai said. They used them to make new things, he said. It's just like we recycle paper and plastic today.

Early humans didn't worry about pollution, said Avi Gopher, another archaeologist. But they recycled because they worried about some of the same things we do.

It could go as far back as 1.3 million years ago, said Deborah Barsky, an archaeologist. Some flint bits were found near a prehistoric lake in Spain. But she said it was hard to tell if they were really recycled.

"I think it was just something you picked up unconsciously and used to make something else," Barsky said. Only after years and years does this become a custom, she said.

Each day, 34.3 percent of children and teens eat pizza, fried chicken or another fast-food dish. The information is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

## For Young People, Many Calories Come From Fast Food

There was one big difference, though. Asian-American children and teens were less likely than other youths to eat fast food. About 8 out of 100 Asian-American children ate fast food on any day. This can be compared to 11 out of 100 Latinos, 13 out of 100 whites and 14 out of 100 African-Americans.

Age was another important difference. Older children and teens were more likely to eat fast food than younger children. On a typical day, 9 out of 100 younger children, ages 2 to 11, ate fast food. A total of 17 out of 100 older children and teens, ages 12 to 19, did so. It did not matter whether the children were boys or girls, rich or poor, or skinny or heavy. It also did not matter where the child's family came from. The pattern was always the same.
Woodblock printing was developed more than 1,800 years ago in China. It is a form of printing that involves a block of wood with an engraved surface which is rubbed in ink and pressed against paper, leaving behind words or a picture. Recently, scientists discovered that woodblock printing has value in the laboratory.

## How We Are Identified

Race is an idea that is always changing. From the 1890s through the 1930s, an African-American with a mixed-race background, for example, could be classified as everything from "mulatto" to "black" to "Negro." Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category separated into Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians. The stakes were high: Except for freed slaves given citizenship in 1864, non-whites were not allowed U.S. citizenship for many years.

Chavez was born July 28, 1954. He was one of seven children. His family lived in a dirt-floor home. He had a mixed background: Spanish, African, and Native American. His parents, though both teachers, had little money. They sent him to live with his grandmother. He dreamed of becoming a baseball player. However, at age 17 he entered Venezuela's military academy.

In February 1992, Chavez tried to take over the government. He failed and spent two years in jail. When he was released, he became a politician. He ran for president in 1998 and won with more than half of the vote.

During his presidency, Chavez opened grocery stores that sold food at very cheap prices. He gave health care and education to the poor.

Venezuela has a large oil supply. It sells the oil to other countries for lots of money. Chavez used the oil wealth to gain influence. He gave billions of dollars in cheap oil to Cuba each year. Beginning in 2005, Chavez gave cheap heating oil to poor people in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York. Chavez made several speeches at the United Nations. During one speech in 2006, he called U.S. President George W. Bush "the devil." Chavez criticized the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He made friends with enemies of the United States, such as Iran.

Chavez had a weekly TV program that sometimes lasted seven hours. He was both the host and guest. The show was called "Hello President." It featured Chavez speaking, singing and dancing. He sometimes used it to criticize the United States. In February 2005, he said the U.S. was planning to kill him. "If I am assassinated there is only one person responsible, the president of the United States," Chavez said. In later years, he used Twitter. He gained four million followers; he gave his three millionth follower a free home.

Even though he was elected, critics said Chavez acted like a dictator. He was accused of dominating the courts, Congress and the media. He changed Venezuela's Constitution to let him run permanently for president.

However, even his critics admit that he gave the poor a voice. But many Venezuelans remain poor, even though they got some help from Chavez. Many feel less wealthy because the economy weakened and prices on basic goods rose. Crime increased during Chavez's presidency. Venezuela's capital, Caracas, became one of the most dangerous capitals in the world.

Despite the criticisms, Chavez is a hero to many Venezuelans. Huge crowds gathered to see his coffin carried through the capital. They wanted to say goodbye to their leader.

## "It's Out Of Control"

CHICAGO — Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel began his second term as mayor on Monday. He took the unusual step of focusing his inaugural address on a single problem: The city's disadvantaged young people.

Second inaugural speeches tend to be trickier for elected officials than the first. The first time, they often talk about what they will do in office. The second time, they often talk about what good things they've done and list what is important for the second term. Emanuel's decision to draw attention to a single problem is not common.

## A Divided City?

Before Monday's speech, much of the attention had been on Chicago's money problems.

Both the city and Chicago Public Schools owe large amounts of money. Emanuel is having difficulties getting money to fund the pension plan. The city and school district's credit ratings have been called "junk," which means ratings agencies on Wall Street think the city will have a hard time paying back the money it owes, or its debt. Also, Emanuel is trying to figure out a new job agreement between the city and its teachers so they don't go on strike.

Most of them are not treated correctly, according to a new study.

## Reminders Are Helpful

"I wonder how many emergency rooms even know this is happening," she said.

Manning knew that thousands of people search online every day for information about their ancestors. So he published the names under the mystery photos on his webpage.

Cook sent Manning pictures of Blanton as an adult in Shelby, N.C. He took them to Maureen Taylor, a face-recognition expert he'd relied on in the past. Taylor has been called the nation's best historical photo detective. She said the faces matched perfectly.

"I never cease to be amazed when I find descendants of people in the photos," said Manning, 72. He is a retired social worker in Florence, Mass. "I'm not only giving them back their history, but I'm giving the children (in the photos) back their dignity."

"If granny ever mentioned working in a mill, I don't recall," Cook added. "But I do know she was very protective of children, especially little girls. She was determined I would have pretty things — clothes, dolls — all the things she didn't have as a little girl. She spoiled me rotten. She wouldn't let Mother spank me."
ALEPPO, Syria — Entering the prayer room of a mosque built in the 1100s, a teenager named Hussein Mansour plopped himself down. He placed a grenade and a small bag of pretzels on the table. Hussein and the others in the room are rebels fighting the Syrian government. Their goal is to remove President Bashar Assad.

Hussein picked up the grenade again and pretended to pull the ring. A fellow rebel fighter, Abu Musab, gave the 16-year-old a harsh look.

As the Syrian civil war rages on, hundreds of exhausted rebel fighters are deserting. Many others are being killed daily. More and more, teenagers like Hussein are taking their place.

Hussein took a break from fiddling with the rifle and motioned to the gun rack beside him. "These are just rifles my 6-year-old brother could shoot."

In a war that has already claimed more than 190,000 lives, boys like Hussein expect to die one way or another. Most seem to live by the words often heard in rebel areas: "It's all one death."

MIAMI — Early in 2014, officials noticed something unusual at the U.S. border with Mexico. Tens of thousands of children were crossing illegally, without their parents.

Most of the children eventually found places to live. More than 3,100 of them ended up living in South Florida.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government wants to give greater protection to chimpanzees.

## Chimp Population Drop

At first, the two groups of chimps used different sounds for apples. Three years later, they had developed a common sound to stand for the fruit. Before, scientists thought learning language from each other was something only humans could do. Now, they know that chimps can do it too.

BEIJING - For animal lovers in China, the week kept getting worse.

First, tourists in a southern resort reportedly picked up a stranded dolphin. They took photos with it instead of immediately calling for help. It later died.

Then, border police announced they had caught two men trying to sneak more than 200 bear paws into the country. The feet are considered delicious in some parts of China.

It felt like the warriors could have marched faster. What was supposed to be a 100-minute flight last month ended up delayed, diverted and finally canceled. In the end, it took passengers 18 hours to get to Beijing.

If things go as planned, there might soon be lots of new babies in China. The Chinese Communist Party controls the country's government. On Friday, it announced that it would ease the one-child law. Couples in which either partner is an only child will now be allowed to have a second baby. Previously, only couples in which both parents were only children were permitted to have a second child.

Population experts believe the change will benefit about 10 million couples, including Luo and her husband. She is an only child, but he is not.

The tower was built without nails. It is 82 feet tall and has 11 six-sided levels that are stacked like the layers of a wedding cake. It is decorated with painted roosters, chickens, peacocks and ducks. They are painted in bright blues, greens and yellows. There are also trees and bamboo. A smaller two-story tower with eight sides sits on top of the building.

## Protecting The Drum

BEIJING — People in China are taking to the streets. The fast-growing country has enormous environmental problems. Its population does not trust the government. People are increasingly wired through online devices. Because of these things, it's no surprise that people are voicing their anger. They are protesting garbage dumps, chemical factories and other projects.

The latest protest was in the southern Chinese county of Boluo, where thousands of people marched through the streets Saturday. They were against a planned garbage incinerator, where garbage is burned and discarded. Police arrested 24 people, which was fewer than expected. Observers took it as a sign that the Chinese government will let some protests like this take place.

Dealing with garbage is becoming a problem for local governments. Chinese people are buying more and more things. China generates about 200 million metric tons of solid waste every year. In 2004, it passed the United States as the world's largest producer of garbage. By 2030, it is expected to make twice as much waste as the United States.

Some experts say incinerators are the best way to get rid of garbage. In crowded parts of China, landfill space is limited. Nie Yongfeng is a professor of the environment. He said new incinerators in China work as good, if not better, than the ones in Europe. People against the incinerators use old information to create fear, he said.

Others say the government has not been clear with its numbers. It knows how much pollution the waste burners create, but those numbers haven't been released to the public. "It is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely," said Lin Youzhu. She works on solid waste for Friends of Nature, China's oldest environmental group.

Having an operation? Better slip the main doctor some money. Don't forget the one giving the painkiller, too.

"I'm absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo. He is a math teacher who now fights for social change. Luo is campaigning against what he calls widespread corruption in China's society.

Gift-giving has long been a big part of Chinese life. But these days it is increasingly colliding with modern anti-bribery laws.

One mid-level official had a collection of timepieces that included a $62,000 Vacheron Constantin. This earned him the nickname "Brother Watch." It also got him a 14-year prison sentence.

Legally, officials are not supposed to take gifts worth more than about $820 each. But the law is widely ignored. And when it is not ignored, it is unevenly enforced.

BEIJING, China — A 59-year-old woman in China got a big surprise when she visited the new local cemetery. She said her name was written in gold letters on one of the tombstones.

The woman complained to the cemetery staff but did not get any real answers, according to a report in Beijing's Jinghua Times.

Wang recently went to court, saying that people who built the cemetery had hurt her name and her family's reputation. Three relatives also had fake graves, she said. She wants the people who run the cemetery to say they are sorry. She also asked for $16,000 for her emotional pain.

## Death Is A Doorway To Profit In China

When she would come home, she would have to change into warmer clothes. She would take off her outdoor winter jacket and put on thick, padded pajamas. Her Nike sneakers were not warm enough to wear inside. So she wore boots with fur when she was in the house.

## Turning On The Heat Is A Big Day

BEIJING — China's government maintains careful control of what the country's citizens can see on the Internet. Its system for blocking news it does not want people to see is known as the Great Firewall.

In the United States, a small website is trying to poke holes in China's Great Firewall.

## Don't Mention The Explosion!

BEIJING, China — China has promised to stop selling ivory — it just has not said when it will actually do it.

Cristian Samper is president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. He said Meng's remarks should be a warning to poachers all over the world.

Now that China has made up its mind about ivory trading, Samper says the government needs to make a plan. It needs to figure out how to make sure ivory trading stops. Samper also says people should stop buying ivory. That way, poachers won't have a reason to kill elephants.

## Elephant Population Is Declining

WEIFANG, China — Dragons, eagles, butterflies cover Zhang Xiaodong's workshop. There are even mechanical kites. There is one that shows a frog trying to devour a praying mantis.

Zhang is one of China's most loved kite makers. As the 65-year-old craftsman showed off some of his life's work, he listed the benefits of kites.

"Flying a kite also elevates your mood," he added. "You can write your worries on the kite. And when it soars high in the air, you can cut the string and your worries will fly away."

## Video Games Versus Kite Flying

## Inspired By Kites

Sun's living room smells like bamboo and paint, while its walls are filled with symbols of old China: kites, photographs, paintings and huzi — twisted gourds that have deep symbolism in Chinese myths. Sun said his fascination with the past started with his grandfather, who taught him the old accents and ways of Beijing, including Beijing opera.

"That is the problem we face. People don't have the sentimental attachment to traditional kites," he said. "They rarely fly them."

BEIJING — China launched a rocket to the moon early Monday. It carried a buggy-like vehicle that is expected to roam and explore the moon's surface for three months. China hopes to make sure that the next man on the moon is Chinese.

The Long March rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center on schedule at 1:30 a.m. Monday, Beijing time, China's official news agency reported.

A landing vehicle and the rover should touch down on the moon's surface in about two weeks. That is the plan. It would be the first soft landing on the moon since 1976, when the Soviet Union landed the Luna 24 spacecraft. A soft landing is a landing in which the vehicle does not break up.

The unmanned rover is gold-colored. It looks like a dune buggy. The rover is expected to conduct scientific projects like planting a telescope on the moon's surface and exploring under the surface of the moon. It will send photographs back to Earth.

## Aims To Put A Man On The Moon

There was a burst of moon exploration in the 1960s and 1970s. The big moment was the 1969 landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. But since then, the moon's appeal has gone down. People want to explore planets and asteroids instead. In 2010, President Obama killed plans for the Constellation program that was supposed to return Americans to the moon by 2020.

BEIJING — For Americans, Chinese New Year brings to mind colorful parades and fireworks in Chinatowns across the United States.

In China, it involves millions of people returning home. The Lunar New Year festival, or Spring Festival, starts Friday for this Year of the Horse. Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages for the holiday. It's an occasion to share time and gifts with family and friends.

## In One Migrant Community

They've been traveling the country by bus, train and plane. They'd been to more than 12 cities from late December to mid-January. At each stop, they offer up crowd-pleasing tunes from movies like "Titanic," "Dances With Wolves," "The Incredibles" and "The Godfather."

## Jumping Around A Park

## Anger Toward Government Rules

The study was published on Monday. It examined the air in 90 Chinese cities between 1981 and 2000. This information was then compared with death rates in 145 places across the country from 1991 to 2000.

SHANGHAI — Zhang Mei Lian is worried about her 16-year-old son. She is worried that he's falling behind his female classmates in school, and that he isn't athletic enough. She is concerned that he doesn't know how to repair things, such as a broken light. Basically, she fears he doesn't know how to be a man.

"Our current education system is really bad for boys," Zhang said. "Boys should be strong. Otherwise, they are all turning into some kind of feminized boys."

Zhang isn't the only one who's concerned about young Chinese men. Many in China are worried about whether change is leaving boys behind. This is not just a concern here. Boys' falling scores in school have been the subject of several studies in the United States.

"We tend to describe it as the feminization of men or lack of manliness," said Li Wendao who co-wrote a book titled "Save the Boys."

## Cultural Cross Currents

BEIJING — Many Americans reacted with a shrug when China landed its first rover on the moon last month. After all, the U.S. sent men to the moon more than 40 years ago. And the Russians landed a rover there too.

Wally Wang is deputy general manager at Keer America. He believes more Chinese textile companies and other manufacturers will follow Keer to the United States.

That would be welcomed in Lancaster County.

Springs Mills in Lancaster once employed close to 20,000 people. In 2007, the last South Carolina textile factory closed.

These Little Piggies Go To Market

Instead of adding DNA from another creature, the micro pig was made by removing a piece of its own DNA, said Max Rothschild. He is an agriculture professor at Iowa State University.













Shengnu are being blamed for all kinds of things, explained Sandra Bao. She started a group called Leftover Attitude in Shanghai. It supports unmarried professional women. "Parents are pressuring us, the media label us, there's a whole industry of matchmakers and others out there telling us it's a problem to be single."









SHANGHAI — For two days, Rocky had been playing video games in the tiny apartment he shares with three other men in Shanghai. He left only once, to buy food. The games "help me relax," he said. "It helps me escape. I feel so tired."

In June, the 32-year-old quit his $400-a-month job selling traditional Chinese medicines. Rocky has had nearly a dozen jobs since he graduated from college a decade ago. His mother lived in a poor village a few hours north of Shanghai by train. She died in May.

"She worked so hard to try to give me everything, and I could never do anything for her," said Rocky. He requested that only his English name be used because he's embarrassed to be poor. "I feel so lost. I am such a loser. There is such a huge gap between my reality and my dreams."

Rocky and people from his generation are known as the post-'80s in China.  Adults who were born in the 1980s have seen  China change quickly in major ways. The biggest changes have to do with money, goods and property. Under China's old system, most property such as land, businesses, farms and homes were owned by the state.

Wang Wei, 27, works for a local government in Nantong, a coastal city near Shanghai. She expressed a similar hopelessness.

"I don't think the situation will get better," she said. At night, she works a shift at a Kentucky Fried Chicken. She said she couldn't get a promotion in her government work because "it is very clear that those who get promotions all have family connections. Opportunities are not really fair for capable people. All we can do is accept the way things are," she said.

A total of 458 people were on board. At least 15 people were taken to safety during the rescue effort, including three pulled from the boat Tuesday. At least five people died in the accident, the Xinhua News Agency reported.

The boat was carrying mostly elderly tourists from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing.

Divers rescued a 65-year-old woman and, later, two men who had been trapped, Chinese television station CCTV reported. More people have been found alive and were being rescued.

CCTV video showed rescuers in orange life vests climbing on the ship's hull. One of them lay down on the boat. The rescuer tapped the boat with a hammer, listened and then gestured downward into the boat where he thought he heard sounds.

The ship's captain and chief engineer both survived the accident. Police took them to be questioned.

## Ship Suddenly In Trouble From Storm

The overturned ship drifted almost 2 miles before stopping close to shore.

## Upside-Down Boat Might Still Have Air To Breathe

The boat had been carrying 411 passengers and a crew of 47. Most of the passengers were 50 to 80 years old.

Many Americans don't know that for more than 60 years, the United States officially excluded an entire ethnic group: Chinese immigrants.

The Chinese Exclusion Act, first passed by Congress in 1882, was not undone until 1943.

Fung's restaurant served what Americans thought of as Chinese food in those years: mostly chop suey and chow mein. Only later did he add Cantonese dishes, egg rolls and other items.

One of the first people he hired was waitress Lorraine Kristoff, whose family was from Hungary.

The exclusion act was renewed and made permanent in 1902. Only one senator — George Frisbie Hoar — was willing to vote against the law.

One result of the exclusion act was that Chinese-American men with families in China were often unable to see them for years at a time. When the law was finally lifted in the 1940s, it not only allowed new Chinese immigrants into the country, it also gave Chinese men who were already here the right to live with their families.

BEIJING — When Ma Wenfeng was a boy, the last thing he dreamed of was becoming a farmer. His father earned next to nothing growing wheat and corn. The family was so poor it mainly ate mantou, a kind of plain steamed bread.

Now it is his greatest hope to start a farm — but not in China. In his country, the word "farmer" is pretty much the same as "peasant." Most Chinese farms are small, run by poor farmers who work long past retirement age.

China is getting wealthier very quickly. This has led to a huge demand for imported food, said Ma. "When we look overseas, we see large tracts of land where you can operate a farm."

"We want to bring American sunshine, land and water back to China," said businessman Zhang Renwu. He himself owns two farms in Utah.

Chinese companies are buying up farmland wherever they can.

Last year, Chinese company Shuanghui International bought Smithfield Foods and a vast amount of U.S. farmland: more than 100,000 acres in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina.

LOS ANGELES — Real estate agent Alisha Chen began selling homes 10 years ago. Back then, she did not expect to be working with buyers from overseas.

Then U.S. housing prices dropped and Chinese money began to flood into the country. Today, Chen has a new specialty. She helps rich overseas Chinese buy homes in Southern California.

BEIJING — Eating a fatty Peking duck dinner might make some feel guilty about not watching their diet. But healthy types who dine at the Da Dong restaurant chain here in the Chinese capital don't have to feel so bad: They did a little weightlifting before their meal.

That's because the menus at Da Dong are heftier than a small gym dumbbell: 5 pounds, 4 ounces, to be exact. The 140-page menu measures 20 inches tall, 15 inches wide and more than an inch thick. It outweighs National Geographic's Global Atlas.

Packed with rich color photos, the volume is divided into chapters. A table of contents listing about 200 dishes runs four pages.

Da Dong's gigantic menu may be among the most eye-popping in town, but it's hardly alone in its big size and fancy design. All over China, restaurants have been supersizing.

## BIG And Colorful

If diners really want to take home a menu, Dong said, there is a way: They can purchase last season's for $200.
LOS ANGELES — Yosemite High School once offered six wood shop classes. Now there are three.

Things got worse when a new high school opened close by. Many students transferred. The number of students is down from 1,100 five years ago to about 700 today.

School officials are now looking to a faraway place for help. As soon as next fall, Yosemite High in California could welcome 25 students from China. They would pay $10,000 or more each year in education costs. The students would bring money and give an international flavor to a school with few families from other countries.

Two Chinese students are at Yosemite High this year. Xiao "Travis" Ma of Inner Mongolia plays clarinet in the marching band. Chengyu "Johnny" Zhang of Shanghai is on the running team. Though the Chinese food here isn't how they'd like it, they appreciate the clean air and the extra space they have at the school, which is set near mountains.

## An International Flavor

The foreign students have raised concerns about the work of private companies that find students.

WASHINGTON — On his first day of teaching Chinese in a Florida middle school, Xu Dou showed his students how Chinese characters used to look. He wanted them to see how the writing has changed over the years.

He said he'd explained to his class that Chinese characters were a central part of Chinese culture. "I tell them if you want to learn real Chinese, you have to learn how to write Chinese characters."

That will take a lot of memorization and practice, but Xu's students already have a good start. Many began learning Chinese two years earlier at their elementary school. Li Meng, another newly arrived teacher, is working there this year.

Chinese is an important language for Americans to learn. But the government has stopped giving money for schools to teach languages before college.

LOS ANGELES — Edward Marks has dreamed up some of the most exciting amusement park attractions in the United States. His team has invented high-tech rides and glow-in-the-dark parades. They've even made 3-D simulators full of mummies, aliens and crazy clowns.

But to make money from China's theme park boom, Marks needs more than creativity. He must become an expert on Chinese folk stories and superstitions. He also needs a lot of patience.

The Chinese have smoked tobacco for centuries. For many years, women were as likely as men to smoke. However, things changed after most Chinese switched from pipes to cigarettes during the early 1900s. Cigarette-smoking was seen as not very ladylike, and before long, many women quit smoking.

At the same time, male Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public. They made the habit even more popular among men.

It has been more than 200 years since that first contact. The five tribes that now make up the Chinook Indian Nation have a constitution, a tribal council and annual meetings. They are not, however, recognized by the U.S. government.

The Chinooks may gain recognition under a proposal to change how Indian tribes are officially recognized. The new process was announced May 22. It is part of an effort to make tribal recognition more organized and transparent, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

## Hearings On The Matter

CHONGQING, China — When the air-raid alarms sounded in Chongqing, people hid in bomb shelters. They ran for the caves dug into the mountains. There were never enough hiding places from the Japanese bombs.

On May 4, 1939, 7-year-old Chen was huddled inside a crowded cave in Chongqing. Bombs fell outside. Small bits of metal flew everywhere, wounding Chen and killing both of her parents.

Collier is leaving the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) for Trail Life USA. Trail Life is a new group formed by Christians who want a choice besides the Boy Scouts. It will start forming its first troops at the end of September.

Collier will be starting a Trail Life troop. He said one day it will include his son, who's now 4 years old.

"I'm glad I am building something my son can enjoy from next year to when he's 18," said Collier. He said he left the Boy Scouts because they changed their rules and their belief system. "Trail Life USA is going to stick to the standards that the BSA abandoned."

Stephens thinks Trail Life is desperate. He says it's a doomed escape to a past that no longer exists.

KERDASA, Egypt —  Three months ago, the Archangel Michael Christian church was attacked by hundreds of people. Six people tried protect this place of worship from attack. Rida Gaballah, 49, was one of them. But he now stands among the ruins of the building.

The Egyptian government promised to repair this church. But work has yet to begin here. It is one of 74 churches destroyed since the army removed President Mohammed Morsi from power on July 3. The destroyed building reveals the attacks that were carried out by Morsi's Islamist supporters. It also shows the government's failure to protect old churches.

TRENTON, N.J. —New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a bill that makes it against the law to try to change children from gay to straight. The governor said Monday that he signed the bill even though he was not very willing.

## Running For Re-election

LIVINGSTON, N.J. — New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has announced that he is running for president. He says he plans to "change the world."

## Fading Popularity In Home State

And then it was back to work, as if nothing had happened. No mention of the surgery at any of the meetings Christie held that week.

"If I had the choice, I wouldn't have ever talked about it," Christie said on Tuesday. He said that a news report about his surgery was indeed true.

## Keeping Quiet

This week, Chuck E. Cheese's introduced the biggest change to its food in more than 10 years. It is meant to make the restaurant more appealing to adults.

The new menu includes things like thin and crispy pizza. For dessert, it will have New York-style cheesecake.

"If we provide a good experience for mom and dad, they are going to be more willing to take their kid to Chuck E. Cheese's," he said.

















"If the government watched the KKK as hard as they do #BlackLivesMatter, maybe we would know #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches," tweeted another. The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a group that burned black churches in the past.



































NEW YORK — There are bugs everywhere. There are bugs on the trees, on the shrubs, on the grills and on the front steps. There are crunchy shells of bugs on the ground, and bug bodies with dead orange eyes clinging onto leaves.

"I love them; it's nature," said Kempf, a Staten Island resident. Kempf  recently collected 300 bugs in a cooler to bring to his yard, in the hope they would multiply. "It's only once in 17 years, you have to enjoy it while they're here."

He is referring to the cicada species that descends on parts of the East Coast every 17 years. The bugs make a high-pitched screech, mate like crazy, and then die. Cicadas leave their eggs on twigs that fall to the ground. The tiny babies then crawl into dirt holes for 17 years. Then it happens all over again.

## A Noisy Neighbor, Briefly

People on Staten Island have another problem.

Now, their corpses are beginning to pile up. The smell. Matarazzo likens it to the smell of a dirty, wet dog.

Joseph Saye is 22 years old. He has smoked since he was 19\. He did not think a new law would make much difference. He said younger smokers would still find a way to buy cigarettes. 

DUBLIN — Ireland and the U.K. are firing the first shots in Europe's latest war on tobacco. It's a battle that may end up being fought in the courtroom.

## "I Don't Want To Live On A Farm"

These parents are pushing cities to become more family-friendly. In Seattle, Minneapolis, Denver and elsewhere, parents are calling for more schools and playgrounds. They're also looking for cheaper housing for families near city centers.

"The benefit of living in the city far outweighed what we would get by moving out to the suburbs," said Jenny Kelly, age 32.

## Raising Kids With Culture

NEW YORK, N.Y. — Many people in New York City think the rats are taking over.

Last year, more than 24,000 people complained to the city about rats. This year, the number could go even higher.

Many look like they are from the 1800s. Now, one company is doing something different with them. It fills them inside with modern, high-tech machinery.

Read was president of a company that built a double-decker streetcar. Today, it travels from a shopping center in Los Angeles to a farmers market next door.

Read says that streetcar was the model for everything they are creating today.

## Skimming The Surface?

Some experts say this exam does not capture what they want students to learn.

People fear too much testing means there is less time for teaching topics like civics. One study found this to be true. More than a quarter of the school districts said they spent less time on social studies.
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., was the only speaker from the 1963 march. He fired up Saturday's crowd. He pushed them to fight against a Supreme Court decision last June. The decision struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Passing that act was an important civil rights victory in the 1960s.

"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.," he told the crowd, referring to the 1965 "Bloody Sunday" march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. Protesters were brutally beaten back then on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. "I got arrested 40 times during the '60s, beaten and left bloodied and unconscious. But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight and continue to fight, and you must fight."

Many young people and adults wore T-shirts or buttons. Some carried signs protesting the verdict in the George Zimmerman trial. Zimmerman was found not guilty in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Martin's mother was cheered loudly when she appeared.

Emma Daniels, 70, wore a cap with buttons from the 1963 march. Daniels pointed to where she and other members of her Georgia church stood 50 years ago.

Songs for the civil rights movement continue to be written. As Newsweek magazine said of the civil rights movement in 1964, "History has never known a protest movement so rich in song."

## Rebuilding Trust With The Public

## An African-American Confederate

KENOSHA, Wis. — Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War rages on. Cannons roar and smoke drifts across a battlefield. Men in blue and gray charge screaming at each other.

America's Civil War pitted brother against brother. Neighbor against neighbor. Northerner against Southerner. By the time the fighting ended, hundreds of thousands were dead or badly injured.

Parents and lawmakers both like the idea. At least 40 states have cut class sizes in the past 15 years.

Experts mostly agree that smaller classes are good, at least in the earliest grades. Smaller classes lead to better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Sometimes, little things can bring big changes. Justice Crawford and Nathaniel Nitkin are learning this. A violin and a cello are instruments bringing big changes for them.

What if you had to worry about getting sick whenever you took a sip of water?

For about 800 million people that fear is a reality. That is because they do not have clean drinking water.

## Risky Water

## Deadly Diarrhea

Petronella's village now has its own well.

## The City Is Changing

People in Cleveland still have bad memories of two other people killed by police last year. A 12-year-old black boy named Tamir Rice was shot by a white officer because he was carrying a toy gun on a playground. Tanisha Anderson was a 37-year-old mentally ill woman. She stopped breathing while officers held her down on the ground.

About 7,000 years ago, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru. Their lives revolved around fishing in the Pacific Ocean. Yet, just behind them, farther inland, was a desert — the Atacama. It has often been called the driest place on the planet.

The Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in how they buried their people. They created the oldest-known mummies on Earth, beating the Egyptians by several thousand years. In 1917, Chinchorro mummies were first discovered in the Atacama Desert.

## Newer Mummies Are Not In Great Shape

### CON: Later would give technology a chance to develop





SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — Surfing first came to California in 1885. Three Hawaiian princes introduced the sport to Santa Cruz by riding simple boards made from California redwoods.

Surfing has changed a lot since then. Today, surfers check satellite weather forecasts on their cellphones before heading out to catch waves. The biggest change to California surfing, though, may not be the surfers. It just might be the waves.

"It definitely worries me," big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt said. He has already noticed changes in water temperature and weather patterns during the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.

A wave that a surfer rides is usually created far out in the ocean. Storms far from shore send swells, or sets of waves, toward the California coast. By the year 2100, these storms could shift. The swells might move parallel to the coast instead of toward it.

It has long been believed that people act more violent when it gets really hot. But few people have done a real scientific study to test the idea that high temperatures can lead to fighting.

It is a way to help Clinton connect with younger voters. So far, her famous friends have not changed the thoughts of younger voters. Many students like Bernie Sanders better. Sanders is a 74-year-old senator from Vermont. 

## A Tight Race In Iowa

WASHINGTON — On Sunday, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she will be running for the office of president of the United States. The campaign will be her second attempt to become president.

## Hitting The Road For Votes

Clinton claims to be a strong supporter of women's rights, so she should have turned down Saudi money, Paul said. "Instead, she's accepting tens of millions of dollars."

## Not The Only Democrat Out There

NEW YORK, N.Y. — Hillary Clinton is running for president, and Lorella Praeli has one of the most important jobs on the campaign. Praeli, however, has never before voted in an election.

It will be a tough job. Latinos do not vote as much as other groups. Also, many young Latinos are not interested in voting.

Rivers is inspired by the example of his father, Doc, who was also an NBA basketball player. While playing basketball, Doc Rivers went back to college in the summers. Eventually, he managed to earn his degree. He then went on to become a sports broadcaster. Today, he coaches the Clippers.

"I went back my first two years," Doc Rivers said. "Everyone told me, including my professors, 'If you didn't go back right away, you're probably not going back,' so I went back."

NEW YORK — Donald Sterling was banned for life from the NBA. Sterling owns the Los Angeles Clippers. The league banned him because of racist comments it says he made in a recorded conversation.

NBA official Adam Silver said he will try to force Sterling to sell his team. Silver also fined Sterling $2.5 million. Silver was clearly outraged over the comments.

Sterling admitted that he was the man on the tape, Silver said.

In 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court answered these questions. A Christian group at a California law school did not accept gay students. As a result, the school took it off the list of official student groups. The group then sued the university for violating its rights. The Supreme Court ruled that what the law school did was legal.

Sixteen-year-old Audrey Dimitrew recently won a spot on a club volleyball team in Virginia, where she lives. She hoped to impress high school coaches and possibly even college coaches.

Some parents get upset when their children are cut, benched, yelled at by coaches or even fouled too hard. Lately, many of these parents have been turning to the court system for help.

Some people see this as a movement in youth sports toward being much more competitive. Teams and leagues aim to give players a better chance at getting a scholarship that would pay for their college education.

Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up weekends for kids to be on travel teams and play in competitive high school programs.

## Falling Short Of The Goal

Enigma resembled a typewriter. It had 26 lettered keys. But it was far more complicated. It had three or four electrically wired wheels. The wheels could produce endless combinations of coded letters. To make deciphering even more difficult, there were a number of different models. Each model had its own way of changing the message.

Batey hardly got any introduction.

However, some parents and experts wonder if children need to learn how to code. They think that these lessons might be unnecessary for children. Children already use technology every day. They think children should enjoy summer days outside instead of in the classroom.

Jim Taylor is a professor at the University of San Francisco. He said that teaching coding to children as young as 5 to 10 years old is ridiculous. Taylor thinks that it is more important for children to play. When children play, they learn important social skills, he says.

CHICAGO, Ill. — Computer programming can be a great job. Most high school students, though, do not know much about it, like Darius Taplet.

Code.org works with 90 of the nation's largest districts. One of its largest programs is in Chicago Public Schools. The district has announced a plan to offer computer science programs for all grades.

CHICAGO — Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon, 20, wants to be a police officer. But one thing is standing in her way.

Does she think she'll ever use advanced math as a police officer? "Not really," she said. As a police officer, she says she will have to catch criminals, not use algebra.

## A New Approach

SEATTLE — Nearly 900 fifth graders filled Western Washington University's gym in October.

Western isn't the first university to use college students to help younger kids. What makes the program different is that it starts in fifth grade. That is a critical time when kids start to compare themselves with other kids.

The college students spend three weeks learning how to work with kids from different backgrounds. The college students spend seven weeks working in classrooms as tutors and role models.

The university doesn't know if the program works yet. For that the university has to wait until the original group of fifth-graders graduates from high school. Then it will see how many of them go to college.

## Talking About College

## Some Schools Get Few Visits

On Nov. 10, the president and chancellor of the university quit. Since then, protests have happened at more than 100 colleges and universities across the county. Social media sites, like Twitter and Facebook, have been buzzing. 

The students are calling for change. They say that racism takes place at their schools. They are using protests from the past to inspire them. They are holding hunger strikes and sit-ins, and they are writing lists of demands.

## Protests Play A Role In History

CHICAGO — Tara Montgomery tried rowing once in high school. It didn't hook her. She only went to rowing practice after her mom offered her an iPhone as a bribe.

Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first order of fresh-cut flowers to Miami. Since then, Colombian flowers have grown into a billion dollar business.

Flowers in the United States were once expensive and sold only at specialized shops. Today, they are much cheaper and are found in many places. They can be bought everywhere from grocery stores to gas stations.

## A Few Businessmen

BOGOTA, Colombia -- Luis Enrique Neira urges his scrawny horse Pagatodo through a busy street. Neira has been a horse-cart driver, or a zorrero, since he was 12 years old. He scrapes out a living hauling loads and sometimes recycling scrap metal and cardboard.

Rodriguez said it's strange to find horses and mules pulling wooden carts through this major city. Bogota is almost as large as New York City. It is South America's second-largest capital, packed with gleaming high-rises.

Bogota has been home to working animals for centuries. Horses and mules can also be found on the streets of Buenos Aires, Santiago and Montevideo. But in those cities the animals are usually kept in village outskirts. In Bogota, horse carts are part of the landscape. They clog traffic and keep people on foot alert for horse droppings. City governments have been trying to get them off the streets for at least 50 years, Rodriguez said.

Rosa Garzon, 50, brought her horse Mil Amores to the trade-in. She received a paper that will entitle her to a vehicle. She said she could earn anywhere from $30 to $100 a day with her horse. But recent bypass surgery and bouts of low blood sugar make her scared of driving a motorized vehicle.

"I have a car now but they've left me without work. I don't know how to drive," she said, carrying a well-worn bridle. "I hope one of my children will get a license and we can still make some money."

RIOHACHA, Colombia — Elion Uriana is a tribal judge, or palabrero, in Colombia's native Wayuu community. As the leader of a group of goat-herders, he was trying to decide what to do about an arranged marriage that had fallen apart.

The groom's parents had given the bride's family a wedding gift of 60 goats. However, the bride left him just a month after they were married. The bride's parents blamed the groom and said he had mistreated their daughter. The families could not settle the disagreement, so the bride's family had to pay back the goats.

Uriana had helped arrange that marriage as part of his job as palabrero. Young people in the Wayuu community do not get to choose whom they marry. "All our marriages are arranged by the families and the couple has to live by that," Uriana said.

## River Serves Many Needs, People

JEFFERSON COUNTY, Colo. — Rescue and recovery teams in Colorado continued their efforts on Sunday. Major flooding has soaked the state and hundreds of people remained unaccounted for, meaning no one knew where they were. The number of people dead and missing continued to rise.

Officials said there were at least 700 Coloradans still listed as missing in Boulder and Larimer counties. Flooding washed out bridges and roads. Several central Colorado communities have been cut off.

Gov. John Hickenlooper said he hoped that many of the missing were simply unable to get in touch. He hoped they were already out of danger or staying with friends.

WICHITA, Kan. — Seth Ogden is 8 years old. When he was younger, his grandma asked him about the roses in her backyard.

People like Seth can see between 10,000 and 100,000 basic colors. But people who are not colorblind can make out 1 million colors. The world does not appear gray to Seth, but when colors are close together he struggles to tell the difference.

After Seth won the contest, EnChroma sent him a free pair of its color-correcting glasses. They usually cost hundreds of dollars.

Earlier this month, he tried them on for the first time. 

"Whoa," he said, with his parents looking on. The sun shimmered through tree branches that had lost their leaves for the winter. Everything looked golden.

Explorer Barry Clifford said Tuesday he found the Santa Maria near where Columbus said it was shipwrecked.

## Columbus' Journal

American women will soon be able to go to war on the front lines. And they will go with the public's support.

The U.S. military said it would no longer ban women from combat. A new poll shows most Americans support the decision.

Military leaders announced the decision last week. They noted that women have already been risking their lives in war for more than 10 years.

Fourteen percent of U.S. troops are female. The military says 152 women have died serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

## Ban Hurts Careers

Servicewomen say that the ban hurts their careers. Serving in combat is a stepping-stone to leadership in the military.

In fact, not many people do think female troops should be restricted to desk jobs.

## "We Are Problem Solvers"

This fall, most elementary students in her school district have weekly computer lessons. The lessons are part of a new idea in the United States. The idea is to teach computer science to more school children.

Learning computer science also helps people get jobs. By 2020, there will be 9 million science, technology, engineering and math jobs. Half of those will be in computing, the U.S. government said.

## Critic Opposes Coding For Young Kids

One problem is finding enough teachers who are well-prepared to teach computer science.

Classes in computer science are taught in only about 1 of every 4 U.S. high schools. Even fewer schools teach computer science in lower grades.

Still, there has been a jump in interest. In 2015, nearly 49,000 students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science. The number was up from about 40,000 in 2014. The exam is a test that high schoolers can take that counts in college. 

A student could hit their head in a car accident or while playing sports. If their brain is hurt, they might have problems in school — even weeks after the accident.

Recently, Brandt and Astelle released three adult condors into the mountains. Two of the birds had been treated for lead poisoning. The other had an operation on an injured wing.

They had been fitted with number tags and radio devices. These will allow scientists to track them.
WASHINGTON — There is a Confederate battle flag on government property in South Carolina. The flag is a symbol of the Confederacy from the Civil War.

In 2000, the flag was taken off the top of the main government building. It is still on a part of that government land.

## Others Say Flag Should Come Down

ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Leo Twiggs' paintings might disturb some people. Many of his works show the Confederate flag — the flag of the South during the Civil War. Others show faceless men with bulls-eyes on their backs. Such pictures reflect his experience living as a black man in the South.

"This Confederate flag, the Civil War, they are part of the history of all of us," Twiggs said. "You take the stars off the bars" of the flag, he said, and "it becomes a cross, maybe a railroad crossing. It can become a crossing over." In other words, it can become something we get past, even as we remember it.

Twiggs has been painting flag pictures since the 1970s.

Ndakasi and Bauma live in the 3,000-square-mile Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. There are about 880 wild mountain gorillas left in the world. About one-quarter of them live in Virunga National Park.

## Baby Gorilla's Mom Was Shot

Virunga National Park was set up in 1925. It is the oldest and largest park in Africa. It has more animals and plants than any other park in Africa.

Virunga has more than just mountain gorillas. It also has lowland gorillas and chimpanzees. Virunga is the only park in the world with three types of great apes. It makes Virunga a very important place to protect.

SEATTLE, Wash. — Jesse Okwu grew up in Chicago. His closest link to the outdoors was nature programs on television. When he came to Washington state for a program on protecting nature, its national parks became his first real experience with the wilderness.

The concern is that most of the people in conservation are too much alike. Most of them are white and middle class.

## Loving Nature, Relating To People

Tim Cook, the top boss at Apple, announced last week that he is gay.

"Here's what I want you to do," the famous chef said in a serious voice. "Don't cut yourself."

Garces said the benefit of such lessons "is pretty instant. It's not just the English. It's the confidence it gives them in the workplace, and they take that out into the community as well."

PUEBLA, Mexico — A Mexican nun has now become a television star.

Florinda Ruiz Carapia is one of five finalists on Mexico's "Master Chef." On the show, people compete for a 1 million peso prize, which equals $59,000. The best cook wins.

## Prize Would Help Her Help Others

When they grow up, the quiet kids from middle school will rule the world. Or, at least, they'll live healthier and more productive lives than the "cool" kids will.

A new study looked at 13-year-olds who acted older than other kids their age — by doing things like dating or shoplifting. These were often seen as the "cool kids."

Misty Copeland has become the first black ballerina to become a principal dancer at American Ballet Theatre (ABT). On Tuesday, she was promoted to the top role.

The same number of 9- to 12-year-olds watch Netflix, the report said. Many younger children do as well.

There is an endless choice of funny videos on YouTube. Some are even educational. As kids get older, they are watching more on Netflix. It offers shows with longer stories. Kids who are 9 to 12 years old often want to watch programs with plots, not just videos.

## Stuff Your Age Group Watches

YouTube now has a new service. It is called YouTube Red and costs $10 a month. There are no ads on YouTube Red. Kids can also watch when they are offline. The service will eventually have original programs with YouTube stars. 

KidSay reports that YouTube is the most-used cellphone app for boys and girls ages 8 to 11. It is also their favorite app and top website.

Boys' favorite YouTube channels include "JackSepticEye" and "PewDiePie." These channels are part of an important group on YouTube. It has made comedians and people who talk about video games famous.

YouTube is still a winner with younger girls.

Susan Polizzotto's two daughters Rachel, age 9, and Lauren, 11, watch several YouTube channels. They use their own iPad tablets. The kids watch Stampy's Minecraft videos. They also check out clips on how to paint their nails or do hair.

Their habits are like those of other pre-teen girls. Pre-teens also love video posts, called vlogs. "Shaytards" and "Bratayleys" were among their favorite channels in the KidSay survey. The vlogs are created by real families. Their real kids are the stars. Young girls like seeing the families in the vlogs. It feels more real to them than what is on TV, Burke said.

In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with amazing news. He had learned of many things during his travels to the New World. Back then, America was known as the New World. One of the most exciting things Columbus found out about was a grain called corn.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Dave Vierra started small. He planted his first corn maze 12 years ago. It was meant to be a sideshow to his popular pumpkin patch in West Sacramento. The maze covered just half an acre.

But just like field corn, it quickly grew — and grew. Now, Dave's Pumpkin Patch and Cornival has two corn mazes. The larger one is 10 acres and the other 2-acre maze is "haunted" for weekend tours. Zombies and other characters provide fright-filled fun.

There's more to do at Vierra Farms than just navigate through mazes. Kids can jump on a 40-by-60-foot air-filled pillow, and climb hay bales. They can play in a giant "corn box." It's the same idea as a sandbox, only this one's filled with dried corn. The Cornival also offers a "Pumpkin Princess Castle," pig races, pony and hay rides. Pumpkin chuckin' cannons shoot gourds 1,500 feet into the air throughout the day.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Jennifer Kavanaugh has been a teacher for 13 years. During that time, she never dreamed of hitting a child — not even once.

"Corporal punishment does not make for a more peaceful, happier child," she said.

The move away from corporal punishment is happening across the country. For the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished, compared with about 223,000 in the 2005-2006 school year.

"We need to" ask "more of teachers," she said.

Senate committee Chairwoman Jolie Justus said she wants to move the bill forward. Nonetheless, she thinks there could be a problem when it comes to private schools.

"I suspect we'll hear from people who don't want" the state interfering "in private schools," Justus said. "At some point, we may need" to make some changes when "folks come and talk to us. Right now, I haven't heard" from anyone who's against it.
DENVER — On Wednesday in suburban Denver, around 1,000 high schoolers took part in a large student demonstration. They had turned out to oppose a new set of high school history standards. The standards had recently been proposed by the area's school board.

Most of the young protesters gathered at a busy street corner. They chanted "Education without limitation!" and waved signs and American flags.

Students began walking out of classes in waves on Monday. Hundreds of students from at least six area schools have taken part so far.

The dozens of students who left Alameda International High School asked McMinimee about the school board plan. McMinimee said he was worried that students have not been fully informed.

Students, he said, "don't necessarily have the whole picture."
NEW YORK, N.Y. — The New York City students sang and played ukuleles and guitars. Then their music teacher walked in. Her name is Liz Rose, a country music songwriter.

## "Y'all Made Me Cry"

Rose first met her students over Skype. The app lets people talk and see each other and talk over the Internet. Rose helped the students write the words for their song. They performed it this past week at All for the Hall. The concert took place in New York City. It raised money for educational programs at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. Students shared the stage with musicians Brad Paisley, Paul Simon and Carrie Underwood.

Kyle Young is in charge of the Country Music Hall of Fame. He said he felt emotional when he saw the students on the stage.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Leslie Fram arrived in Nashville four years ago to work for CMT, a country music TV channel. She quickly saw that women were facing serious problems in the country music business.

"There are people all over the country that are seeing these examples as beacons of hope to take big money out of politics," Donnelly said. 

However, not everyone supports the new program.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said Thursday that no company or person can get patent rights over genes found in the human body. This decision could make it easier for scientists and businesses to do more genetic research.

Lawyer Vernon Winters said that the court's decision has limits. Scientists can still try to get patents. They can get them for specific ways of working with genes.

Attorney Barbara Rudolph said that it was "hard to predict" how the decision will affect companies and inventors. Patents encourage people to invent, but they can also be a roadblock to more research. The court wanted to try to find balance between the two sides.

Justice Antonin Scalia's one-paragraph opinion showed how scientifically complicated the case was. He noted the "fine details of molecular biology" in the court's decision.

Scalia said he didn't have enough knowledge of his own about those details to say if they were true.
Fisherman's Wharf is the home base for fishing boats in San Francisco, California. It is usually much busier this time of year. Workers should be getting ready to haul in millions of pounds of Dungeness crab. People love to eat them at Thanksgiving and other holiday meals.

## New Discovery, Old Human Relative

KAVOUSI, Greece — In June, the digging once again began. Slowly but surely, an ancient city lost for thousands of years is being uncovered in Crete, an island off Greece in the Mediterranean Sea.  .

Archaeologists — scientists who study ancient civilizations — and American students were at the dig. They were there in hopes of discovering clues about life in the city of Azoria. The ancient Cretan city was destroyed by fire about 2,500 years ago, and very little is known about it now.

The project is the life's work of archaeologist Donald Haggis.

Digging is only allowed for six weeks a year, but Haggis has been at it since 2002. Much work has already been done.

People from both places will begin to work together, said Mauro Guillen. He works at the University of Pennsylvania.

## Colleges Line Up For Exchanges

Under older travel rules, some colleges had permission to send students to Cuba. However, getting this permission was difficult. People who applied often were rejected.

Guillen said that a lot of his students want to go to Cuba. They see themselves doing business there in the future. Guillen has led student trips to Cuba.

For many U.S. colleges, Cuba is also a place to look for new students.

An attorney in Miami named Lenny Feldman made a list of the products that could be exported. He calls it his "yes" list. The list includes the specific items that entrepreneurs — businesspeople — from Cuba can now sell to the United States.

## Some Items Are Still Banned

In Cuba there are road signs pointing to a turnoff for Camilo Cienfuegos City. But it doesn't exist. At least not by that name.

"AIR-shee" is what everyone still calls it. Hershey.

Most of the town founded by U.S. chocolate company owner Milton Hershey in 1916 is in ruins. The giant sugar mill was once among the world's most advanced. Now, rusted machinery spills from the wreckage like it was blasted by a bomb.

## Businesses Were Kicked Out

Today, U.S. businesses are hoping for a chance to work in Cuba again. Small towns like Cuba's Hershey are hopeful, even if no one really expects the Americans to get the mill running again.

Milton Hershey chose to build an all-American town in the sugar cane fields on Cuba's northern coast.

## Ambassadors Would Move In Again

A country on the terrorism list cannot buy weapons from the United States or receive economic help.

Democratic Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois helped reach the agreement with Cuba. He said that he is not a fan of Castro's government. But opening up Cuba to American ideas and trade is the best way "to see a more open and tolerant Cuba," he said.

Opening the door with Cuba "will create a force for positive change," said Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. Ignoring Cuba achieved nothing, Durbin said.

Silently, they measure the angles of violin pegs and viola necks. The instruments around them are bent out of tune from years of use.

Here in Cuba's capital city Havana, Andres Martinez and his two apprentices are doing what they can to help solve a problem. A country famous for its music is running low on musical instruments.

Cuba's dozens of free music schools turn out thousands of skilled young musicians each year. Many play imported instruments that can only be repaired with hard-to-find materials from overseas. String instruments are among the hardest to keep in good working order.

## Old Quality Versus New Cheap Stuff

MIAMI — In a country that once considered breeding mini-cows, Cubans have become masters of invention.

They punch holes in the bottom of a water bottle. And presto, it's a shower head. If they can't find AA batteries for the TV remote control, they use a rubber band to attach a C battery and surf away.

They roast hot dogs and hamburgers on a metal chair. Raw eggs are repurposed to plug leaks in car radiators. To stop a car from leaking oil, they get out a bar of soap.

## "Making Do"

CHICAGO — Doctors have new advice for parents: Limit kids' time online. They should also keep smartphones and laptops out of bedrooms.

It's been linked with violence, cyberbullying, school woes, weight problems, lack of sleep and other issues. True, it's not a major cause of these problems. But "many parents are clueless" about the strong effects Internet use can have on their children, said Dr. Victor Strasburger.

MILWAUKEE — This week, farmers viewed a shocking video. It showed farm workers slapping and poking sick and injured dairy cows. The workers used heavy machinery to force the cows to their feet. The video was taken secretly of Wiese Brothers Farm in Wisconsin.

Mercy for Animals is an animal rights group. It hired an investigator to take the video in the fall. The video shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm dragging downed cows. The workers pulled the cows by their legs and necks using chains attached to tractors. They whipped the cows, too.

The video also showed cows suffering from open wounds. Animal care experts call the treatment shockingly cruel.

Wiese Brothers Farm did not speak to the media. The farm's owners released a statement instead. It said  two employees were fired for suspected animal abuse. The farm is cooperating with an investigation into animal cruelty claims.

He grabs a seat on the train. Last year, more than 54,000 passengers rode this train for 12 hours to the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota. That's more than double the number of passengers since North Dakota's latest oil boom began.

Young men like Klefstad are pouring into these fields because the science of fracturing has changed the oil business. Fracturing, or fracking, is where water and chemicals are used to break through rock to get to gas or oil below. It's now possible to reach oil 2 miles deep in North Dakota.

Like the California gold rush in 1849, today's migration is on a huge scale.

There is a new exhibition at The Dali Museum in Florida. Visitors will not just look at art. They will feel like they are walking around inside a painting. Virtual reality will make this experience possible. VR is a three-dimensional world created by computers.

The new exhibition is called "Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination." It tells the story of a friendship between two men, Salvador Dali and Walt Disney. Dali was a famous artist known for his unusual paintings, sculptures, and life-size art. Disney was the great American animator and creator of Disneyland. 

The VR movie takes viewers inside a Dali painting. It is called "Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's 'Angelus.'" In the painting, giant stone figures are in the middle of a desert. There are elephants and birds. Users can move around. They feel like they are moving up through a stone tunnel. They hear piano music and the cries of birds. 

"You actually have a three-dimensional feeling that you're inside a painting. It's not like anything you've ever felt before," said Jeff Goodby. His company is called Goodby Silverstein & Partners. They created the VR experience. It seems like there are objects closer and farther away as you are walking by them, he added. 

Disney and Dali also worked on a short animated movie called "Destino." The six-minute movie can be found on YouTube. It features a dancing girl with long dark hair, and a song with the line, "You came along out of a dream. ... You are my destino." Clips will be played within the gallery for the Disney-Dali exhibition. The full movie will be shown at the museum's theater.

The exhibit may be full of 1970s clothing and disco glitter. But Warhol's take on fame feels modern. It fits right in with 21st century America's love of reality TV and celebrities.

## "It's Ghost-Like Matter"

NEW YORK, N.Y. — New customers at the Mozzeria restaurant see that something is different. Nearly every worker is deaf.

Owners Russ and Melody Stein are not able to hear. They have run their San Francisco restaurant since 2011. The business is thriving because customers love the food. Also, the Steins have succeeded in dealing with problems deaf business owners face. These are problems that hearing people do not experience.

"We have the same skills as a hearing individual," Russ Stein said.

Running Mozzeria comes naturally to Melody Stein. Her family owns restaurants.

"It's something I've always wanted to do," she said.

## Equal Ambition And Ability

Business owners who can hear are often surprised when they first meet the couple. Some of them feel uncomfortable. Some have thought that because the Steins are deaf, they didn't know what they were doing, Russ Stein said. Some have not wanted to go out of their way to help them or have said hurtful things

"He said there was good out there, something different," said Ta, now 21. Ta's mother sent him away so he could escape the unfair punishment his family and other ethnic Karens faced in their native land. She died shortly after he left.

Five years later, Ta was on a plane to Virginia. He was helped by the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program.

MEXICO CITY — In a corner of Alejandra Pinzon's room in Mexico City is a pink drawer full of her most cherished possessions. They remind her of a life that's slipping from her grasp.

Pinzon was 17 then and living in the United States illegally. She wanted to go to college, but knew that wasn't possible. If she went back to Mexico, she decided, she'd be able to get her degree there. Then, with luck, a U.S. company might arrange for her to return on a work visa. She might be back in as little as four or five years.

Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.

BERKELEY, Calif. — A group of fourth-graders in California came up with a plan after their 10-year-old classmate was deported to Mexico. They wrote an online letter asking for Rodrigo Guzman's return that got 2,788 signatures.

WASHINGTON — Recent research suggests that diet soft drinks may actually cause weight gain. Now, a new group is charging Coca-Cola and PepsiCo with false advertising.

Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi are "advertised to make us think they assist in weight loss," the group said. "In fact ample scientific evidence suggests that this is not true, and the opposite may well be true."

PHILADELPHIA – Typhoon Haiyan is one of the largest tropical storms ever recorded. It hit the Philippines on Nov. 7. Thousands of people died and more than 600,000 lost their homes. The full damage is not yet known. Telephone and Internet service aren't fully back up yet. It's hard to travel on some roads.

The University of Minnesota just purchased its first Disklavier. Alexander Braginsky, a professor of piano at the school, sees it as a valuable teaching tool.

Initially, it will be used to receive tryout recordings for the 2015 International e-Piano Junior Competition to be held at the university. The university will also use it for teaching.

But that's just the beginning, he said. He has used one of the Disklaviers to do piano lessons when he is in Minneapolis and the person he's teaching is in New York. Someone in New York can teach piano to someone in Tokyo, he added. "I think the uses for music education are yet to be fully explored."

The Pew Research Center took a poll last month to mark the 25th birthday of the World Wide Web. It found that 81 percent of U.S. adults use laptop and desktop computers at home, work, school or someplace else. The January poll of 1,006 Americans also found that 90 percent of all U.S. adults have cellphones. More than half of these are smartphones. In the 18-29 age group, 98 percent have cellphones. And 83 percent of them are smartphones.

The Pew Research Center's Internet project found that 87 percent of U.S. adults use the Internet at least occasionally. And 71 percent use it every day.

"This is a significant increase from the year 2000, our first measure. Just 29 percent of all adults said they went online on a typical day," according to Pew.

HORSE MOUNTAIN, Utah — Scott Richardson stood atop a ridgeline near his base camp at dawn.

"This is dinosaur country," he says, gesturing toward the valley below him. "There are bones all over this place."

Scientists currently think the blobs are super small remains of ancient pigment granules — bits of animal coloring. Scientists think the blobs are clues to the colors of winged dinosaurs.

But a new study offers a different explanation and has upset some scientists.

Siats, though, isn't related to the dinosaur family that the T. rex is from. Instead, it's from the allosauroid family. It's related to the Giganotosaurus, found in South America.

He discovered a 3-inch bone that belonged to a 94-million-year-old dinosaur.

## Dinosaurs In Texas

The paleontologists wrapped the bones in plaster. They moved it to Jacobs' lab at SMU. There, they will take the skeleton apart, clean the bones and try to put together the dinosaur.

The scientists say they probably will never know why the Nodosaurus died.

Dinosaurs must have kept the tooth fairy busy. A new study shows that the dinosaurs known as sauropods grew new teeth as often as twice a month. And they had up to nine backup teeth underneath each tooth.

While the terrifying Tyrannosaurus rex is known as the king of the dinosaurs, the sauropods were even bigger. These creatures were the largest animals that ever lived on land.

A big T. rex was around 45 feet tall. But a big sauropod was 100 feet long or more, said Michael D'Emic, a scientist at Stony Brook University in New York. D'Emic is a vertebrate paleontologist — he studies ancient animals. He is the main author of the study published Wednesday.

D'Emic has been fascinated with dinosaurs since he was a child. He knew that because sauropods were enormous, they had to eat a huge amount of food. This made him wonder: Had all that eating caused their jaws and teeth to evolve — change over time — in some special way?

The next step was to break apart the jaws. He wanted to remove the 30 teeth he could see. He also wanted to get to the backup teeth underneath each tooth.

D'Emic was not only interested in seeing how many spare teeth sauropods had. He also wanted to figure out how quickly those teeth came in.

D'Emic also noticed that more recent sauropods, like Diplodocus, had smaller, narrower teeth that got replaced a lot faster. He wondered: Why had they evolved that way?

Sauropods didn't actually chew their salad. They clipped it off with their teeth and then swallowed it whole. Perhaps getting new teeth so quickly kept their teeth sharp for the hard work of cutting vegetation off trees or bushes, D'Emic said.

He believes Diplodocus's narrow teeth suggest that they grazed on vegetation close the ground. Teeth that were narrow would have helped them to not swallow dirt picked up along with the vegetation. With Diplodocus only eating plants down low, Camarasaurus would have had plenty of food up high. That way, there was enough for everyone.

"Last night I had a salad that I grew in my own yard. And I really had to wash the lettuce carefully, because there's this grit in it," said Sereno. "It's exactly what we're talking about. You put your muzzle down to the ground and you're going to be [taking in] these sand grits that wear your teeth down."

ST. LOUIS - The roommates at Colgate University would talk about what they hoped to do after college. They were just freshmen, but they had some ideas. One wanted to be a lawyer. Another, a music producer. And then there was Ryan C. Fogle from Missouri. He wanted to join the FBI or CIA.

"Those were his goals in life," Ben Flicker, one of those roommates who is now an attorney in Denver, said Wednesday.

The skies over Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida are "national defense airspace," the alerts said. Planes flying over Disney parks could be forced to land. The pilots could be questioned and arrested.

These no-fly zones are known as temporary flight restrictions. Planes cannot fly near the president when he travels, for instance. Forest fires and large sporting events also often get temporary flight restrictions.

Michael P. Huerta is the leader of the FAA. Huerta told Congress that he would like to end the no-fly zones over Disney.

Defenders of the no-fly zones say the Disney parks deserve special protection. They claim Disney parks have a special place in people's hearts and attract large crowds. If airplanes could fly over Disney parks, people could attack them from the air.

Then, Disney spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said the law would keep out "banner ads" and prevent pilots from "buzzing the parks."

## A Court Case

In response, government lawyers defended the Disney no-fly zones. They said the zones made the Disney parks safer for tourists and that Disney held a special place in the minds of Americans.

Steve Crampton is the lawyer who fought the Disney no-fly zone.

Since the no-fly zones began, there have been no major terror attacks, Crampton pointed out. "I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker."
## Character Rules Must Be Followed

ORLANDO, Fla. — Curtis Doyle is excited for the trip his family is planning to Walt Disney World next summer. He reminds his dad about it each day. Sometimes he mentions it more than once a day.

It might seem like a small change to most families. But it's not to Brad. His son, like many people with mental disabilities, has a habit of becoming attached to certain things. He becomes frustrated when he cannot have or do them. Sometimes he melts down in outbursts and bites his own hands.

Disney will soon end its "guest assistance card" program. Parents of children with disabilities are alarmed at the news. Some have written letters in protest.

Both Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando do things differently. They generally make disabled visitors return to rides at certain times. Disney will begin using that same model Oct. 9.

Tourists and locals who have year-round passes are flooding Disneyland and California Adventure. Waits for rides often stretch over an hour. Visitors have to park far away. Sundays are the worst.

Theme park experts say the crowding problem leaves Walt Disney Co. with two choices. The company can keep raising prices until attendance becomes manageable. Or it could make the park bigger.

Over the weekend, Disneyland raised single-day ticket prices by $4 to $96. It also temporarily halted new sales of a popular annual pass for people who live in Southern California. Disneyland officials say they have no current plans for a new Anaheim park. Still, that hasn't stopped people from talking about one.

## Time To Dust Off The Old Plans

Speigel said theme parks across the country could see double-digit increases in attendance this year. The increases could be as much as 25 percent.

In Southern California, Universal Studios Hollywood also recently raised its one-day ticket prices from $84 to $92.

But Disneyland's decision to halt sales of its $379 Southern California Annual Passport is expected to play the biggest role in reducing crowds. The pass lets people come to the park 215 days of the year, including Sundays.

Local pass holders often crowd the parks. They leave little space for out-of-town travelers. Out-of-towners typically stay in Disney hotels and spend more on souvenirs. The program gained popularity in 2008 when it started to let people pay for the pass in smaller monthly payments.

"Pass holders use the park differently than others," said Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix. She is an annual pass holder and chief executive of the Disney fan site MousePlanet.com. "You go to the park like you would go to hang out at the mall with your friends."

Suspending sales of the annual passports is an attempt to reduce Sunday crowds. Part of the idea is to encourage people who live nearby to visit during the week. Crowds are smaller then, industry experts say.

Disney continues to sell a $289 annual pass for Southern California residents. The pass does not include weekend visits. Disneyland officials say they have no plans to suspend the sales of any other passes.

"It's a challenging situation," said John Gerner, managing director of Leisure Business Associates. The company gives advice to theme parks. "Disney doesn't want to be seen as taking advantage of customers, but they have an obligation to try to make as much profit from their park."

Other pass holders complained that the park has not added new rides. They say that there is no reason for the higher prices.

SHANGHAI, China — The Walt Disney Company is opening a new park in China. It will look like a Disney park, but it will blend in some Chinese culture as well.

Disneyland Hong Kong had trouble when it opened. There were long lines during Chinese holidays. Some animal lovers did not want the park's restaurants to serve a certain Chinese soup. The soup is a Chinese tradition, but sharks are killed to make it. Disney decided not to serve the soup. They did not want to offend animal-lovers or American customers.

Some things will be different than other Disney parks. For example, there will be no Main Street U.S.A. In Hong Kong, the street, which is inspired by small-town main streets in America, was allowed. For the park in Shanghai, Chinese leaders fear it would offer too much American culture for China.

There are no rides based on Chinese stories. Disney is trying to make the park more Chinese in other ways.

Most states do not include bicyclists in cellphone or texting laws. The states that do are California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia. An automobile group says that the state of Pennsylvania even considers bicycles to be vehicles. People driving vehicles cannot use headphones in that state, so bicyclists cannot either.

HARTFORD, Conn. — Porter the dog is trying to figure something out: Why has his owner placed a toy bone under a bucket? The way he acts may tell us something about how humans learn.

That's the hope of Laurie Santos, who runs the Canine Cognition Center at Yale University. She pointed to the 4-year-old chocolate Labrador mix. Porter is growing up in the same kind of setting as human children, Santos said. For that reason, comparing how he learns with the way people learn can tell us a lot about how humans develop.

So much more than monkeys, dogs are tuned into "what we care about and what we know," Santos said. And because of this, "they might have been shaped in a way that's very different from any other animal." They behave much more like a human child than, say, a chimpanzee does.

For all that we ask of dogs — loyalty, companionship, slipper-fetching — rarely have we asked how dogs think. That's now starting to change.

Dogs are messy drinkers. If you give a thirsty dog a bowl of water, a lot will probably be spilled on the floor. Now, scientists know more about why dogs drink the way they do.

Sunghwan Jung is a scientist at Virginia Tech University. He said that different animals drink water in different ways.

Cats use their tongues to drink. They have a special way of drinking. They stick out their tongues in the shape of the letter J. They touch the top of the water with their tongue. Then they bring their tongue close to their mouth. When they bring their tongue up, water comes up too. The cats close their mouths over the water when it it comes up high enough.

It's no surprise that dogs like being petted. Unlike other animals, like porcupines, dogs are a hands-on species that loves physical contact.

But research suggests that dogs aren't the only ones who benefit from the petting. Positive interactions between people and dogs actually make both species happier. After enjoyable activities, like petting, play or talking, both dogs and humans feel a surge of chemicals in their bodies. The chemicals are called endorphins. The endorphins lead to bonding and happy feelings.

A recent study shows that eye contact may be enough to increase our endorphins. Dogs pay close attention to human faces. In some cases, they can even pick up on specific facial expressions. The act of gazing at your dog — or your dog gazing back at you — has been shown to increase endorphin levels.

These findings may help explain our intense and deep relationship with dogs.

Nagasawa recommends that dog owners do more than give commands to their dogs. She encourages humans to think about the effects of their gaze when they are building a relationship with their pet.

MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis. — Jerry Witt survived a full year as a soldier in Vietnam, due to his buddies Skip and Satan.

PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Zoo is in trouble for using dogs to herd its African elephants. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) complained about the zoo to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). PETA is a group that fights for the rights of animals.

PETA has video it says was taken at the Pittsburgh Zoo. The group says it clearly shows that the elephants feel they are in danger when the dogs come out. They put on what scientists call "a threat display." The elephants' ears go out and they make a trumpet sound as the dogs chase them, said Brittany Peet, who works for PETA.

Tracy Gray works for the zoo. She said the zoo's elephants get "the best care possible."

Two Australian cattle dogs were brought in three years ago. The goal was "to advance and improve the care that we provide for our elephants," Gray said. The dogs and elephants work well together, she said.

The main reason the dogs were used to herd elephants was for the safety of the zoo workers, Gray said.

More than half of the zoos in this country use what is called protected contact to manage elephants, Peet said. In the protected contact method, barriers — like fences or bars — are used. The barriers keep zookeepers safe from the animals and workers use food and praise to reward elephants from a safe distance, she said.

In February the USDA looked into the death of 2-year-old Maddox Derkosh at the Pittsburgh Zoo. He died after he was attacked by African painted dogs when he fell into their exhibit in 2012. The USDA told the zoo to pay a fine of $4,550. The agency also ruled that the exhibit did not have enough distance and barriers between the animals and visitors.

SEATTLE — For Daniel Promislow, it is hard to watch his 11-year-old dog, Silver, get old.

"Month by month, he gets slower and slower," said Promislow, a scientist at the University of Washington (UW). His other dog, Frisbee, is still playful like a puppy. At 10, though, she also is old for a dog.

Some experts believe our ancestors in the Middle East and elsewhere were attracted to small, furry wolf pups. They took in the wolf pups as pets. Other experts say people in Asia raised them for food.

"Sometimes, I'm not even concentrating on making a picture. I'm just putting lines on a sheet of paper," Chambers said. He is 77 years old. He said he watches the pencil and pictures just flow from it.

Chambers started drawing in art classes in high school. He continued with the hobby when he was in law school. A law professor noticed his work on a piece of poster board. The professor suggested Chambers consider a career as an artist. Chambers felt sure that the professor wanted him to drop out of law school.

Chambers' collection of art is diverse. It includes a portrait of John F. Kennedy, a former U.S. president. It also includes a drawing of Kennedy's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In 2001, he drew a picture of Elvis Presley. Someone he works with got it framed. The picture now hangs in her office at work.

Chambers receives praise for his artistic talents. Still, he insists he is not a formal artist because he does not have real training.

## Having Fun With Drones

## Drone Business Is Growing

Today, almost no companies are using drones. The U.S. government hasn't allowed them to. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the government group that controls flying in the U.S., including airplanes, helicopters and airports.

Drones are a challenge for the FAA. Traditional aircraft — airplanes and helicopters — come in standard shapes and sizes. They are used for common jobs. Drones can come in any shape and size. They can also be used for almost anything.

Drones can solve problems for many different types of companies. Drones are often smaller and cheaper than traditional aircraft. They can go into areas that are too dangerous for people.

What remains of the drone is sitting at the Los Angeles Police Department. If the owner wants it, police will give it back. Flying a drone in public is not against the law.

"It was kind of an eye-opener for us that this is something we really need to pay attention to," said Commander Andrew Smith. He is with the LAPD. "It's certainly something that's growing enormously."

## A Drone Crash At Sunset

SAN DIEGO, Calif. — Helicopter pilot Jason Thrasher was fighting a fire in California. All of a sudden, he saw what he thought was another helicopter battling the blaze.

He realized the object was a remote-controlled airplane, called a drone. It was only 10 feet from his windshield. He had to turn the helicopter sharply to avoid hitting it, according to a report.

The near-miss last September explains why firefighting pilots are worried. The problems have led to calls for more laws to keep drones away from firefighting aircraft.

## Living With A Drought

Now experts say that farmers might need to rest twice as much land this year.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California's capital city has hot, dry summers and gets little annual rainfall. Yet, the city's lawns are supposed to look like lush lawns in rain-soaked England.

Sacramento has a long history of green lawns. That may be starting to change, however. With a lack of rainfall, local governments are worried about having too little water. California is in a drought. In January, Gov. Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency because of it.

## Saving On Water

LOS ANGELES — On Tuesday, Mayor Eric Garcetti issued a challenge to Los Angeles. He asked the city to cut water use by one-fifth over the next 2 1/2 years.

Experts praised Garcetti for setting deadlines. Garcetti calls for water use to be measured three times: on July 1, 2015, on Jan. 1, 2016, and on Jan. 1, 2017. The goal is a one-tenth drop by 2015, and then more cuts by 2016. By 2017, the city should reach its final goal of a one-fifth drop.

Citywide, people are now limited to watering no more than three times a week.

The Department of Water and Power has increased the number of inspectors looking for water wasters. Instead of just one inspector, there are now four. The department has pledged to take a gentle approach, however. It says it will educate and warn water wasters, rather than making them pay a fine.

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — Paul Brown sets out before sunrise to patrol Sacramento. He is looking for evidence that someone is wasting California's water. It may be a wet sidewalk or a damp driveway.

Every so often he catches someone breaking the law. For example, he's caught people using sprinklers to spray their lawns on a no-watering day.

"I'm not sure I understand the problem," Sortman said, showing off his empty swimming pool. "I'm not able to enjoy my summer this year. I shower twice a week. We don't use the toilet as much. We use our water very minimally."

## Governor Tells Everyone To Save Water

Water is being restricted in different ways. For example, people can use outdoor taps only at certain times. People are also being forced to pay money if they use too much water.

California has faced drought many times before. In the 1800s a drought killed many cattle. In the 1930s another drought caused fights between different townspeople. They all wanted more water than was allowed.

In 2015, the same things are happening. In Madera County, near Fresno, some people are stealing water from their neighbors. Water has become very valuable. The city of Sacramento recently set up a water-crime task force to check when and where people are stealing water. Some people are even taking it from fire hydrants.
SHANGHAI, China — Food writer Christopher St. Cavish is walking toward the front door of the Welcome Revered Guests restaurant in Shanghai, China. Then he stops. "They don't like me here," he says, frowning.

RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina State University's newest library is a little strange: It consists principally of 98,000 tiny glass bottles.

LOS ANGELES — When ancient stars die, they give off colorful clouds of gas and dust, known as nebulae. Recently astronomers discovered something mysterious about some nebulae at the heart of the Milky Way: They all line up in the same direction.

The discovery was made by two researchers from the University of Manchester. Their findings help explain how the stars behind the nebulae formed. And they also may show what unknown forces pulled the nebulae into their strange formation.

A dying star's nebula is a sight to behold. Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers. Soon, it is surrounded with cloud-like shells of gas and dust.

But these shells aren't just interstellar eye candy. Planetary nebulae can tell scientists much about the environment in which they were formed. Nebulae reflect their stars' individual characteristics. And they can reveal whether a star is one of a pair of stars.

## A Powerful Magnetic Force In The Center

Say you're holding a magnet near a bunch of scattered nails. Now suppose that only some of the nails are magnetized. Only the magnetized nails will turn and point if you bring the magnet near. The unmagnetized ones won't move.

Could it be a clue to what happened when Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean three months later?

Longtime Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie thinks so. He thinks the silvery patch is proof that the plane had a repair. He hopes to use a computer to link it to a scrap of metal that possibly broke off Earhart's plane. The piece of metal was found on a tiny Pacific island in the area where Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

Gillespie hopes to match the photo to the wreckage. Someone would have to admit "that Noonan and Earhart weren't lost at sea, but made it to the island," Gillespie said. Gillespie is the head of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR). The group investigates missing plane cases and finds old planes.

Their trip didn't go well from the start. First, Earhart and Noonan landed at the wrong airport in Miami. The landing was rough and the plane needed to be fixed.

One of the windows was removed in the back of the plane. That window can clearly be seen in photos of Earhart's plane taken at the start of her trip.

But in the photo shot on June 1, 1937, the window is gone. It is replaced by that odd silvery plate.

The window must have been broken by the hard landing in Miami, Gillespie said. "So they just took it out and patched the (plane) instead."

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Scientists have found hints that some kind of life existed on Earth 4.1 billion years ago. The hints show there might have been life on Earth 300 million years earlier than scientists thought.

Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago. The new evidence changes what scientists believe Earth was like shortly after it was formed. It also gives them reason to feel confident that there is much more life in the universe. The reason scientists think this is because life formed so quickly on Earth.

## Earlier Earth Life Makes Sense

LOS ANGELES — A group of astronomers say they have discovered an Earth-size planet where water could exist in liquid form. The planet is the first yet found that is habitable, which means that it is the first planet where life as we know it could exist.

Experts don't know if the planet actually has water or an atmosphere to protect it from its sun. But they said the huge discovery suggests that a large group of Earth-like planets is waiting to be found much closer to home.

"This is really a tip-of-the-iceberg discovery," said astronomer Jason Rowe. He and his team spent a year analyzing information gathered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.

## Lessons From Disaster Zones



> 



President Barack Obama announced Monday that the government is creating more rules for airplane passengers. The rules will be for people flying in from other countries as well as in the United States. They are to help control diseases such as Ebola from spreading.

## Keeping An Eye On Other People

They are Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol. They are currently in serious condition, the group said.

There is no vaccine or one clear-cut treatment for Ebola. It is spread through direct contact with the organs, blood or other fluids of infected people.

People who are infected with the virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches. They also throw up and have diarrhea. The disease can cause kidney and liver failure, as well as bleeding inside the body.

It shows that the deadly Ebola virus is changing more slowly than scientists thought.

De Blasio sent a Twitter photograph of himself riding a crowded subway car. He wanted to show New Yorkers that they did not need to worry.

He and Bassett said they had confidence in U.S. medical rules for people returning from Ebola-hit areas. Government health officials advise them to isolate themselves for 21 days and to take their temperatures twice daily. It is believed that 21 days is as long as it can take Ebola to show up in a person.

"He's a doctor," Cuomo said of Spencer, and even he did not follow the guidelines for the quarantine. "Let's be honest. So we have to do more."
DALLAS — A Texas nurse is the first person to catch Ebola in the United States.

## A Single Accidental Slipup

DALLAS, Texas — A man in Texas has tested positive for Ebola. He is the first person outside of Africa to come down with the deadly disease, health officials said.

The United States and Britain are sending troops to Africa to help stop the deadly virus Ebola.

## Lot Of Kids Kept Home

LOME, Togo — Soccer officials in the African country of Togo are afraid to let their team travel to Guinea for a match. Guinea is where the outbreak of the deadly Ebola disease started. To protect their players, Togo is asking that the match be moved to another country.

Then the White House put someone with weak knowledge of health in charge of handling the response to Ebola. This proved the White House is just looking for a quick fix. It just wants to seem like it is doing something.

In an hour of need, our various national and international health agencies dropped the ball. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) have all failed at their jobs.

## Agencies Not Working Together

While these are real problems, they take away from the CDC's job of responding to disease outbreaks.

But the money the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department gets has not gone up. It is the part of the NIH that actually researches the diseases people can catch. Its spending has remained at roughly $4.5 billion a year since 2003.



> 



WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama was right to send U.S. troops to West Africa to help combat the Ebola outbreak. But he did it for the wrong reasons.

Obama called it a "national security" mission. It is definitely not that.

It is not the main job of our armed forces. But these are appropriate missions to be done when U.S. troops are needed and available.

Without question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly send troops, experts and support to help people there stop the spread of the disease.

And it's in our own interest. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from reaching the U.S. is to help defeat the outbreak at its source. Containing the outbreak by banning travel is heavy handed.

Obama made a similar mistake when he called our fight against the extremist group Islamic State a "humanitarian" mission.

But in the tiny nation of Ecuador, the stunt was pulled off so convincingly that even the authorities seem to have fallen for the story.

Moments later, Leonardo Paez was rushed to the scene. He was one of Quito's best known radio personalities. As Paez broadcast "live" from Cotocollao, a long "green arm" emerged from the alien ship and Paez was fried by a bolt of light.

## A Crowd Enraged

Paez was a poet, playwright, reporter, radio actor and songwriter who composed some of Ecuador's most famous music.

Paez received much of the blame for the tragedy. He was accused of creating panic by planting stories in the local newspaper and failing to warn the audience that the show was fake.

"There are so many stories about him, but most of them are just legends," said Ximena Paez, 63, the broadcaster's daughter.

What is known is that on the night of Feb. 12, 1949, the city was seized by panic as the show kept upping the stakes. Radio Quito patched in other broadcasters who were also "reporting" the arrival of alien ships. Police and firefighters were sent to Cotocollao.

The radio station soon realized that it had gone too far. But, when it shut down the show and tried to reassure the audience it was fake, it only enraged the crowd. A mob surrounded the radio station in Quito and set it ablaze.

"We saw an enormous fire," remembers Ribadeneira. "And we could hear the announcer, whose name was Luis Beltran, calling for help. He was saying 'Please let the firefighters through,' but the people wouldn't let them pass."

## "People Died"

Ximena said "The War of the Worlds" was a bittersweet memory for him.

"He was proud of it because it was such a good artistic production that people believed it," she said. "But it was a tragedy because people died."
## Hens In Tight Spaces

## Cage Confusion

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Three weeks ago, if you ordered three eggs at Roxanne's Cafe, you would probably get five eggs on your plate. Cooks did not count how many eggs they dropped into the frying pan. Owner Roxanne Gray gladly allowed it.

## Americans Were Eating More Eggs

Cox, who was 25 years old at the time, started producing more expensive organic eggs. Those are eggs from chickens that are not given any drugs and they eat food that has no chemicals. They are also allowed to go outside.

People are very loyal to the Vital Farms brand. Maurice Sinnett, who lives in Washington state, used to buy Vital Farms eggs at a nearby Safeway. When it closed, he went looking at Albertsons. But they did not carry them either. So Sinnett started shopping at a local grocery store. "It may seem crazy to change stores just for the eggs, but we think they are just that good," he said.

Sinnett likes the richer yolk. But mostly, he appreciates the company's respect for animals. "A woman recently asked me how could I pay $6 a dozen for eggs," he said, "My answer was, 'How much do you pay for a cup of coffee at Starbucks?'"
The president's supporters said soldiers attacked them with tear gas and gunfire around 4 a.m. Morsi's supporters have been camped outside several army buildings for days. They are demanding the release of the president, who has been under arrest.

## Under a State of Emergency









CAIRO — Hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protested in villages and cities on Sunday against Egypt's president. Some fear a revolution may break out and hurt the country's young democracy.

Protesters angry at President Mohamed Morsi filled streets and squares, yelling "Leave, leave." Morsi's supporters also gathered to stand up for their president. The dueling rallies were a sign that Egypt is growing more and more divided.

Earlier studies of Einstein's brain found that some regions were bigger than those of normal people. This was particularly true of the prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobes. But, the authors wrote, Einstein's genius was not only due to the size of these regions. It can also be explained by his thicker-than-usual corpus callosum. This made communication between the two sides of his brain better than average.

This might be because Einstein continued to exercise his brain heavily. He may have prevented the decline that usually comes with age.

Scientist Kenneth Catania made the new discovery.

The new discovery was made by two teams of scientists.

One of the few success stories is a bull elephant named Jackson who lives at the Pittsburgh Zoo. He has offspring all over the United States.

Even submarines cannot go down so deep.

The ship sank within minutes of a final call for help. All 33 crew members died.









##Water Through The Hatch







A fog of thick smoke covers the Indonesian countryside, making hundreds of thousands of people sick. The air is not safe to breathe. The fog has become a health emergency. 

In Ethiopia, crops die for lack of rain. United Nations officials warn that soon there will be a dangerous lack of food. 

Periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean has happened for thousands of years. Scientists only recently discovered how it affects the world, though.

Seasonal rains might not come as expected to parts of India, Africa and Southeast Asia. Crops die and wildfires begin. In parts of North and South America, pounding storms roll over the land.

In Southern California, El Nino is known for heavy rain and overflowing rivers. Yet El Nino may also move rain away from dry farm fields that need water. 

A new research study says weather changes could lead to an increase in snakebites.

## Town's History Is Fading

WASHINGTON - Kenny Clark is a letter carrier in Maryland. But he brings people more than just the mail.

He is a like a landmark in the neighborhood. "Him and his truck," said Amy Dick, who lives on Clark's route. But his future is in doubt. And so it the future of the U.S. Postal Service.

The three are Dick Durbin of Illinois, Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. They were at it again at a recent hearing. They questioned bosses from an industry. They said they were selling an unhealthy product and an unsafe message to young people.

The senators want to make it harder for minors to get the drinks. The hearing was the biggest moment yet in that effort.

LONDON — A scientist says he may have solved the mystery of the Abominable Snowman. The ape-like creature is rumored to live in the Himalayan mountains but is hard to pin down. The scientist thinks the legendary animal is actually a bear.

He ran tests on the creature, also known as the Yeti. They suggest it is the descendant of an ancient polar bear.

Sykes said Thursday that the tests showed the creatures were not related to modern Himalayan bears. They were direct descendants of the prehistoric animal.

WASHINGTON — The number of people in the United States who don't speak English at home is growing very fast.

## Groups Have Different Views

A group of experts in Great Britain and the United States wants to make changes. They want to hold an International English Spelling Congress. The congress would come up with a spelling system that makes more sense.

LOS ANGELES — Nieves Garcia came from Mexico when she was 6. She learned English. Even after she learned the language, her school considered her an "English learner." When she became a mother, she didn't want her own daughter labeled the same way.

So she lied.

When Garcia signed up her daughter for kindergarten, she filled out a short survey. Garcia said her family spoke only English at home. It wasn't true. Her husband does not even speak English.

California plans to use a new English language test in 2016. It may also change its home language survey, said Elena Fajardo. She is with the state Department of Education. The survey questions were written in 1980. Since then, more people have come to California from other countries. The number of people who speak a second language has gone up.

Nearly half of Californians age 5 and older speak a language other than English. The most common is Spanish. Most Spanish speakers in the state say they speak English very well.

That's a big change from 1990. Then, less than a third of people age 5 and older spoke another language. Also, less than half of Spanish-speakers said they spoke English very well.

Most states question parents about what languages they speak at home. Often, children who speak another language are tested in English.

## Young Children, Hard Test

"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said Tony Pernas. He works for the National Parks Service. He also co-chairs the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area group.

## Containment Is Urgent, Experts Say

Irwin was asked whether he was concerned that the tegus may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned by their owners. Irwin responded that none of his customers are local. In any case, they could buy a tegu in a pet store. He said he shares his information about the captured lizards with scientists.

So far, there are no plans to stop letting people keep tegus as pets, according to Kristen Sommers. She works for the FWC.

Sommers said the FWC is trying to determine whether the tegus might expand farther. It also wants to understand what would happen if they do. Within the next year, the FWC will have enough information to decide its next steps.

The first match was particularly exciting. Choi Ji Sung and Mun Seong Won made up one of the teams. Choi is known as "Bomber" and Mun is called "MMA." Chris Loranger and Jang Min Chul were on the other team. Loranger is called "Huk" and Jang is known as "M.C."

"The Coburg Hotel is a lovely hotel," he added. Still, "air conditioning is not what they did best."

The trains, for example, have problems when the temperatures get too hot.

At times, the problem is clear to everyone. On Aug. 3, a high-speed train in Germany was sitting in a station. Suddenly, one of its overworked air conditioning units burst into flames.

## Danger Under The "Heat Dome"

Biking isn't strange for Marion. She also rides in the summer, when Berlin's daylight lasts for almost 17 hours. However, it does make her a success story in Europe. Many cities in Europe want people to travel to and from work by bike instead of by car. For Marion, riding a bike is an easy choice.

## Berlin Is Making It Easier On Bikes

Many of the youngsters are quiet and scared when they arrive. Remarkably quickly, they recover — or appear to. On a recent day, a center in Munich was filled with happy chatter.

KATMANDU, Nepal — Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain. It is also the world's highest garbage dump.

Now, Nepal is telling climbers that what they carry up, they must bring down.

But many think that there are already too many climbers on Everest already. Reinhold Messner is a famous Italian mountain climber. He wants Nepal to close down Everest for a few years. He says this will give the mountain a chance to rest and recover.
Mountain climbers who hike up Mount Everest are used to hearing loud noises. In the morning, the sun will often melt big sheets of ice on the summit. So when Galden Sherpa heard a thunderous boom when he was at base camp, he wasn't startled.

Babies, for example, need regular exercise for their brains to develop fully. Meanwhile, exercise improves children's attention and helps them to do better at school. In the elderly, exercise has been shown to help slow memory loss.

## Exercise Is A Brain Booster

Charles Hillman, who teaches at the University of Illinois, agrees. "We've found exercise has broad benefits," he said. These benefits include "improvements in attention, working memory and the ability to multitask."

Over the last 20 years, researchers have learned that exercise affects the brain in several other ways.

LODI, N.J. — Pet store owner Joe Averso does not run your average pet store.

Averso also has what he described as a "super rare" striped possum. It is a larger South Pacific marsupial. It's about the size of a gray squirrel with black and white stripes, priced at $2,500. These he also he gets from his Florida breeder.

## Got A License For That Skunk?

You cannot keep a skunk in New Jersey unless it comes from someone with the state license. Averso is the only person in the state who is allowed to sell them. Skunk owners must pay $12 a year to keep their skunks.

NJ Exotic Pets works closely with veterinarian Christopher Stancel. He is an exotic-pets expert in New Jersey. He takes the scent out of skunks and fixes them so they can't have babies. He does this before they are sold.

Joe Ricciuti is the owner of 88 Pet World in Brick, New Jersey. He stopped selling skunks a number of years ago. "Is there high demand for pet skunks? No," he said. "Are there people out there who want them? Yes," Ricciuti said.

And because they do want them, Megan Zayatz, 29, gets to clean the skunk cages. She manages the store.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — People living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, were alarmed by reports of a lionlike creature roaming the city this summer. Nets and traps were set up, but the big cat was never found.

## Should Apes And Bears Be Pets?

However, such laws often fail to get passed. Lawmakers often vote against them. This year laws failed in six states, said Born Free. The states were Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wyoming.

"In some of these states, it's very hard to have a conversation about it," said Dylewsky of Born Free.
"I've got all kinds of goodies in back of my plane," Rork said.

## Too Many Chihuahuas

"My buddy had just handed me a cup of coffee in the morning and we're watching 'Good Morning America,'" Wills said. "And there's the Exxon Valdez on TV, spilling oil."

He added, "We were like, 'No!' It was just the start of a nightmare."

The herring of Prince William Sound still have not recovered. Neither have killer whales, and legal issues remain unresolved a quarter of a century later. Monday marked the day when the disaster struck, 25 years ago. On that day, the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef and spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into the waters of the sound. At the time, it was the nation's largest oil spill.

One of the groups continues to slowly recover. The other numbered 22 killer whales at the time of the spill and is down to just seven. Scientists now expect it to go extinct. If so, it would be the end of a whale line that has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last ice age.

WASHINGTON — For nearly 10 years, the F-22 Raptor fighter jets sat on the ground. The aircraft were called too dangerous to fly. People pointed to them as an example of wasteful spending by the U.S. military.

General William Mayville is in charge of operations for the top U.S. military command. He said the aircraft helped drop bombs with precision on many targets. They destroyed the fighters' headquarters, training camps, housing and combat vehicles.

## Flying Faster And Under The Radar

The eight-story Rana Plaza factory complex crumbled on April 24. Nearly 3,000 workers were trapped inside. More than 1,100 were killed. It is the worst-ever accident in the clothing business. Reports from the disaster area have been dramatic.

That is exactly what Missouri State Parks wants to hear.

Not as many people buy permits to camp in Missouri's parks nowadays. Fewer people have been staying overnight in parks across the country since the 1980s. Visitors are choosing the comfort of nearby motels instead.

This year's Learn2 Camp at Weston Bend was the perfect test run.

With the help of park workers, Ron Minter figured out how to put up a huge six-person tent. Isaac and Tessa learned how to pick out different trees, insects and animal tracks. Ron Minter was taught to use sticks to start a campfire. No more lighter fluid and starter logs for him, his wife hopes.

"I think we might be camping more," Kelly Minter said.

The National Park Service said that national parks had nearly 12 million overnight visits in 1981. By 2000, that number had fallen to about 9 million.

Now visitors can stay overnight in nearby towns.

"They have a lot more in the way of services for visitors, like motel rooms and seats in restaurants. Some people love to spend the night near national parks and then get up and go after breakfast in the morning," Olson said.

The Learn2 Camp program does try to take advantage of one positive fact.

NEWARK, Del. — Two years ago, a team of researchers traveled to Africa to search for the best chickens. They weren't looking for hens that laid delicious eggs.

They were seeking birds that could stay alive if the planet got hotter.

Around the country, food scientists are developing farm animals that can withstand [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global warming).

Some climate change activists pooh-pooh their work. They consider it a distraction from the real problem of global warming. They also say the scientists are giving in to large-scale agriculture. The activists blame it for making global warming worse.

WASHINGTON — The fruits and vegetables you find in your neighborhood grocery store today are just as likely to be picked in Mexico and Brazil as in California and Florida.

But even more produce could come from outside the United States, farmers warn. That's if Congress fails to pass an immigration law to make sure there are enough workers to bring in the crops and milk the cows.

A plan in the Senate would create a way for people living in the United States illegally to become citizens. That number of people is about 11 million. Farm workers could become "legal" quicker.

Charles Conner, president of a farm trade group, said the country couldn't keep growing as much food as it does without foreign-born workers.

"If that labor was not available to us," Conner said, "... it would mean that we would get that food from somewhere else."

He said 80,000 acres worth of fresh fruits and vegetables that had been grown in California are now grown outside the United States because of labor shortages. That number came from a 2008 study. Meanwhile, Americans want to know more about the food they eat. They also want it to be locally grown.

There are many concerns about drones. Most states have introduced drone privacy bills this year. About a dozen states have passed laws. They limit the ability of law enforcement to watch people from the air.

The laws have made drone makers uninterested in drone technology for policing. Instead, they are focusing on agricultural uses, said Josh Brungardt. He is an official at a drone research company in Oregon.

Oregon researchers flew drones this summer to check potato plants for disease. Oregon plant nurseries are using them to count trees.

In Florida, unmanned helicopters are used to monitor orange trees. They look for citrus greening. Citrus greening is a deadly disease that kills the trees.

Some farmers fear environmental groups could use drones to spy on them.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Farmers can't change the weather, of course. But perhaps now they will be able to outwit Mother Nature.

WASHINGTON — The head of the FBI said Wednesday that the bureau had used unmanned spy planes inside the United States. This was the first time he has said this publicly.

California Sen. Dianne Feinstein wanted to know about people's privacy. She asked Mueller to give details about how the FBI limits the way investigators use video and other information collected by drones. She called drones "the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans."

CHICAGO — The government's food watchdog took a step Thursday to make Americans' diets more healthy. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is making a rule against trans fat.

FERGUSON, Mo. — Elections held this Tuesday have brought big changes to Ferguson. Its six-member City Council will have three black members, for the first time ever.

## Former Mayor Wins

FERGUSON, Mo. — From midnight to 5 a.m, everyone has to stay inside in Ferguson. Missouri Governor Jay Nixon is putting a curfew on the city. New violence took place in the St. Louis suburb on Saturday.

Public anger here has been high since the shooting death of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer.

## Shouting At The Governor

FERGUSON, Mo. — A white police officer who killed a black 18-year-old will not be arrested. Michael Brown was a teenager who was shot by officer Darren Wilson. His death sparked weeks of protests.

ST. LOUIS — A museum in Missouri is trying to gather images and items from the protests in Ferguson.

## A Piece Of Local History

The National Guard would help "in restoring peace and order," Nixon said. Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb, has been filled with angry crowds since 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed Aug. 9.

## Tear Gas Fired At Protesters

Brown's death was only the first chapter of the story. It is not over yet.

A year later, Brown's death and the protests in Ferguson have changed hundreds of lives. The events also began a national discussion on how police treat black people. Today, Ferguson, a suburb of St. Louis, is not the same town.

MIAMI, Fla. — In South Florida, a rare fern is struggling to survive.

The fern was discovered in 2006 near Florida City. Plant experts prefer to keep its location a secret. The fern is the only one of its kind in the wild in North America. The experts worry that if people knew where to find it, they might take it. Then the fern could disappear forever.

Millions of Filipinos are desperately searching for food and shelter in the wreckage left by Typhoon Haiyan, a large storm that swept through the country. But there may at least be one reason for optimism. Help is coming to them from family members working overseas.

They leave the Philippines because leaders have failed to provide enough jobs in the country.

As in other natural disasters, the overseas workers are leading relief efforts. And it is increasing the generosity of the countries they work in.

Modern presidential libraries are not just concerned with presidents. The libraries also show the work and lives of presidents' wives, traditionally known as "first ladies."

## They Overcame Challenges

SEATTLE — A tiny white sliver inside the heads of fish could show how humans have been wrecking the planet for a century. Atomic bombs, overfishing, even climate change are all there inside.

Fish ear bones are also known as otoliths. They are like tree rings for the ocean. A layer laid down each year gives a snapshot of the fish's yearly growth and what is happening in the ocean where it lives.

The University of Washington's Burke Museum has been sorting through 2 million pairs of otoliths. Scientists hope this collection will help them track the health of both fish and oceans up and down the West Coast. It represents some 80 species gathered over the past half-century.

















There are many fish in the sea. There are also many fish in our garbage cans.

Of all the food that Americans waste, seafood gets tossed out the most. That is not a good thing. After all, very few foods are as healthy. Fish is high in protein and low in fat. Eating fish can even make people live longer.

A new university study found about half of all seafood in the United States is wasted. Families and food businesses buy fresh and frozen fish. Sometimes they do not eat it or sell it quickly enough. Then it spoils.

Jordan was spotted Thursday afternoon and rescued from his crippled boat. He was found about 200 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

"I was flying through the air, somersaulting, and everything was upside down and backwards," he said on Friday.

His boat's mast was broken and its steering system was damaged. The boat capsized at least two more times after that.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — William Howard Taft was the heaviest president in U.S. history. He grew so tired of being made fun of that he asked his doctor to help him lose weight. "No real gentleman weighs more than 300 pounds," Taft said.

Since then, Christie appears to have lost at least half of his extra pounds.

Recently, science students at Aston University in England tested the five-second rule. They claim to have found some truth to it.

In some cases, bacteria find a home in the human body. Bad bacteria can cause infections in the body like a sore throat, tooth cavities and pneumonia, which affects the lungs.

Henry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his Alaska hotel desperate to sleep. He had a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minnesota. He remembers taking a sleeping pill — maybe two.

The return trip ended his long career at Delta and Northwest airlines.

His experience brings up a larger problem for U.S. flight attendants. They work with less rest than foreign flight attendants. And they can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do. Yet they are responsible for passenger safety, just like pilots.

## Exhaustion Leads To Error

There has been plenty of concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest. This came after a flight crashed in upstate New York. Safety investigators determined that pilots in the crash were affected by fatigue.

The FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty. It goes into effect next January.

One aviation expert thinks flight attendants should have as much rest as pilots.

Uncomfortable seats and shrinking legroom have become the things that travelers hate most.

Airlines have become more focused on making money, said frequent business traveler Alex Gerwer. "They don't realize you can't balance your budget on the back of passengers."

FLINT, Mich. — Ariana Hawk heated a bowl of bottled water in the microwave. She dipped a washcloth in the water. Then she wiped her 2-year-old son's red and itchy skin.

Other people in Flint also feel frustrated. Some of then stopped using the water immediately after the change because of its smell, color and taste. Others continued to drink and cook with it.

People, pets, even plants have been affected.

People in Flint feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed. The city has a population of 99,000. About 40,000 people in Flint are poor.

PHILADELPHIA — For the poor, food isn't just hard to find, it can also be rotten and full of germs.

A new scientific study looked at the corner stores that feed many poor people in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The study found that some of those stores sold germ-filled foods that were close to going bad. Eating such foods can give people food poisoning.

"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten," said 47-year-old Rodney Jenkins. "I ate bad fruit from a corner store and got sick."

Jenkins worries about feeding his children such bad food.

The new study is being run by food scientist Jennifer Quinlan.

Quinlan and her team visited nearly 400 corner stores and small supermarkets between 2008 and 2010. They were on the lookout for high levels of bacteria, or germs. The scientists tested a range of foods: milk, eggs, lunch meat, sandwiches, fresh fruits and salad greens.

Each year, illnesses that are spread through food make 48 million Americans sick. About 128,000 people end up in the hospital and 3,000 die, U.S. health officials say.

Food fraud is another problem. Businesses sometimes label food as something it is not. Food fraud is rising. A 2014 study by one group found that one-third of the fish it tested was mislabeled.

WASHINGTON — The government shutdown means many people are not working at some important federal agencies. Their absence has made it harder to protect Americans' health and safety. Investigations into the cause of transportation and workplace accidents have been affected. So has the tracking of diseases that come from food.

## Food Plants Not Being Inspected

## Websites Shut, Hard To Get Information

It can be less enjoyable to eat lettuce that is a few days old. It is not as crisp as it was when it was first pulled from the ground. Eating zucchini that is a few days old is not bad. But fresh zucchini would be better.

A new university study found that Americans are pretty picky about what gets to stay in their refrigerators. The study came out last week. One of the most common excuses for tossing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food." The other common reason is a fear of food poisoning.

Yet caring too much about freshness can also be a very bad thing. Some people throw away perfectly good foods. They do not think the foods are fresh enough anymore.

## Too Much Is Being Thrown Away

The amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has increased. In 2012, Americans threw out about 35 million tons of food. It was almost one-fourth more food than we threw away in 2000.

This new study says that many people worry about food poisoning. It also suggests that food snobbery is not helping. There are good reasons to throw away food. Just saying, "This apple is less than perfect," is not one of them.
Taste is something that scientists already understand fairly well. For hundreds of years, scientists believed there were four main tastes. They were sweet, sour, salty and bitter. Later, a Japanese scientist discovered a fifth main taste called umami. It is caused by monosodium glutamate, or MSG. Umami could be described as something savory. It is a food that is strong in flavor, but not sweet. Umami is common in anchovies, smelly cheeses and soy sauce.

Now scientists believe they have found a sixth taste. It could change the way we eat.

## Tasting The Difference

It's probably much more, according to David Binkle, who is in charge of food services for the district. That comes to $18 million a year of wasted food. The money, Binkle says, would be far better spent on strawberries or watermelons.

At LA Unified, celebrity chefs have helped develop menus. More than 270 schools offer "harvest of the month" lessons about fruits and vegetables. About 450 schools have started gardens.

Still the food piles up in school garbage cans.

At Washington Prep, a few students said they ate their entire lunches. Student Daniel Ofa said he doesn't really enjoy the spaghetti or enchiladas. But he eats them anyway.

### PRO: Many believe GMOs unsafe, want them labeled

Polls show Americans are alarmed over what's in their food. Americans are worried about pesticides, antibiotics, hormones and other unnatural things added to food. They are especially concerned about genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

WASHINGTON — Doctors have a warning for Congress: Don't cut food stamps. If it does, the government could be socked with bigger health bills. Maybe not immediately. But over time more poor people could end up in doctors' offices or hospitals as a result.

## Treating Diabetes

"Food is medicine," says Massachusetts Congressman Jim McGovern. He is a Democrat. He says people against food stamps are just looking at the money being spent.

At the time, Belding volunteered at a food pantry. She had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese. She did this even though there were many people waiting outside the pantry to collect free food.

"We were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate," Belding remembers. She felt frustrated. This feeling would lead her to develop an important technology in the fight against hunger. 

## Saving Tons Of Food

Incognito sent threatening text messages to his teammate, said two people who knew about the situation. The messages were also racist, they said.

The people agreed to speak to The Associated Press only if they would not be named.

Martin left the team a week ago because of emotional problems.

The team and NFL are investigating whether Martin was [bullied](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying). Philbin said Dolphins owner Stephen Ross asked Commissioner Roger Goodell for help. The players union is also looking into the matter.

Incognito has long had a reputation of being among the NFL's dirtiest players.

"There's certain people out there who are just punks, and he wants to be that kind of guy," former Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions defensive end Lawrence Jackson said Monday. "But because he's a lineman, he gets away with a lot of stuff that people don't see. Incognito is way worse than anybody I ever played against."

Last year he was voted by the league's players into the Pro Bowl for the first time. He was the co-winner of the Dolphins' Good Guy Award, given to the team's most cooperative player by the local media. He also won frequent praise from Dolphins coaches for his leadership. This year he was voted by teammates to serve as a member of the Dolphins' player council.

"It gets rid of those little small hits you get in practice," said player Nick Spracklen, 20. "It keeps your head fresh, keeps those headaches away. You leave practice without a headache, your whole day is better."

In one game, the team swarmed their opponents like bees. They won the game by 19 points.

CALAIS, France — The school's floor is sandy from the beach nearby. Its roof is held up by tree branches covered in flowered cloth. Inside, the students are seated at small desks.

"'Light' is 'lumiere,'" said the teacher, giving a French lesson in English to migrants. They have come from around the world to this huge camp in this French city. "A lamp gives you light," the teacher said.

The one-room school is located on one edge of the camp. Every day, students pack the four to six classes held there.

The school began on July 11. It was started by Zimako Jones, who is from Nigeria, in Africa. He lives in the camp along with about 3,000 migrants, who sleep in huts of sticks and tarp. They fled wars and poverty in their home countries and hope to find safety in France. Many are waiting to see if they will allowed to stay in Europe.

Charity groups have given notebooks and pens. Jaumotte bought the paints and brushes for her art class.

Zimako keeps thinking big. He wants to build a second, larger school.

The new school week has sparked protests from teachers and letters from parents. The unpopular government of President Francois Hollande is struggling to defend it.

Officials say it is because of a serious problem. French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year. So educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day.

In other words, fewer school days mean much longer ones. Children as young as 6 stay in class late in the afternoon, until skies go dark and parents get off work.

Adding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to lighten that burden. The declining scores of French students is becoming a real concern. About a quarter of the country's elementary schools have already changed their calendars. The rest are expected to do so next year.

The reason French schoolchildren have had Wednesdays off is an accident of history.

France created its public education system in the late 19th century. The government gave one day a week to the Catholic Church for children to attend bible classes. Many schools stayed open on Saturday mornings. But in 2008, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy decided that a four-day school week was enough.

In Paris, parents are mad. Instead of school days of equal length, the city's new school week is a crazy quilt. No two days in a row end at the same time.

And moms and dads feel cheated. Many have arranged their workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their kids.

Some children do attend church school. But today's parents aren't as religious. Many have found Wednesdays useful for their kids' music lessons, sports practice and other non-school activities. These get little attention in the French education system. Businesses have sprung up to serve the Wednesday desires of middle-class families, offering programs for extra help for kids in things like English.

The situation in the projects goes against French belief that all colors and races will blend into a single people. It is a crime to count people in France by their race or customs. Very different people are expected to blend in and work together.

The last president put out a plan to fix the suburbs in 2008. It included creating more public transport. There were to be "second-chance schools" for dropouts. Youths wanting to start a company or find jobs were to be given help.

The projects outside Paris are a different world from the government palaces of the capital, just a few miles away. Some doctors and postal workers refuse to go into certain projects. Even police are careful because of the drug dealers and criminals.

Some improvements can be seen in the suburbs. The huge apartment buildings in one of the toughest projects in the Paris region have been torn down and nice townhouses built in their place.

But a new train that would reduce the 90-minute journey to nearby Paris and the jobs there has not been finished, and may not be before 2019.

Samir Ouahfi works in a cafe in one of the suburbs. The 29-year-old had little hope that the current government would do better than the one before.

"They say there is equality and fraternity," he said, referring to the French national motto. But here in the projects, he added, "there isn't any."

WASHINGTON — Free lunches are coming to thousands of students all around the country this fall. The 4-year-old government program is finally expanding to all 50 states.

The [free lunch program](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch) is part of the Community Eligibility Provision. This was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010.

Originally, districts had until the end of June to decide to join. The government moved the deadline into August. It wanted to give school districts more time to decide. There were delays in publishing the list of schools or districts able to join.

Nobody knows for sure how many new districts will join this year. But many education officials are making their decisions now. In most states, hundreds of schools are newly able to join.

## Taking Their Time

St. Paul, Minnesota, is another district that is moving slowly. Jean Ronnei is in charge of schools there. She said the district is doing a "test drive." They are starting the program at one high school, one middle school and a few elementary schools.

Alroy looked at extinction rates to predict the future of reptiles and amphibians. Frogs and salamanders are amphibians. Snakes, lizards, alligators and crocodiles are reptiles. Looking back is an important way of understanding the present and predicting the future. It also shows what in the environment around frogs leads to extinctions.

Every animal has to eat and each has a different way of catching its prey. Humans use their hands. Sharks and wolves use their jaws. Frogs are among the few animals that use something much stranger. They use their tongues.

To understand just how frogs snatch their snacks, scientists took measurements of the frogs' tongues in action. It was the first time anyone had done that. They found that certain frogs can lift meals up to three times heavier than their body weight. They use a sticking substance similar to the glue on Post-it notes.

Scientists did an experiment using a horned frog. The horned frog is a round South American amphibian with evil-looking "horns" above its eye sockets. Horned frogs like to squat down and wait for prey to wander by. Then they catch their victims with powerful tongues. They tend to stay still, which makes them easy subjects to use in studies. They are also known for their big appetites — they have been caught tackling prey more than half their size.

## Setting Up The Experiment With A Snack

FRESNO, Calif. — Frogs and toads are at the center of a fight in the Sierra Nevada mountains in California. On one side are people who live in the mountains and the Fresno County sheriff. On the other side are U.S. wildlife officials who want to protect the animals under a law called the Endangered Species Act.

Fish and Wildlife leaders say they are not planning to shut down forests.













Mims later said she was worried that new or expanding businesses would have more paperwork to do. Fish and Wildlife leaders said they were not invited to the public meeting. They said there may be a misunderstanding about the lands labeled a critical habitat.

The label only matters on federal land or projects needing U.S. government permission, spokesman Mole said. The government must be asked in those cases.

The Madera Water Bank in California's San Joaquin valley is one example. That project is in the place where the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, Fresno kangaroo rat and other protected animals live.

More than 300 types of plants and animals are under federal protection in California. That is the most animals in any state and second-most plants.

The next time you receive some cash, inspect it carefully. Fake bills are circulating in the United States and you don't want to get stuck holding funny money.

Criminals are learning to use new technology to print phony bills. Copying money is a crime called counterfeiting. Police and law enforcement say some counterfeit money looks so real, it can fool most people.

In November, a man from Georgia was arrested. He was accused of printing more than $1 million in counterfeit bills. Investigators say the man, Heath J. Kellogg, sold the fake money to get real money. He also paid for expensive items with the counterfeit bills. Days later, he would then return the items back to the store. That's how he tricked the stores into giving him back real money, investigators say.

It is the Treasury Department's job to print the U.S. money supply. The Treasury makes it nearly impossible to copy our currency. For example, the $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills all include watermark portraits. A watermark is an image that can be seen in the paper when you hold it up to the light.

Investigators say Kellogg tried to copy the watermark. Here's how they say he did it. First he printed the front side of the money on one piece of paper. He printed the back of the bill on a separate sheet. Next, he flipped the second paper over and printed a watermark. Then he glued the sheets together.

The forgery was good, but not good enough to fool the Secret Service. You have probably heard of the Secret Service. It is the agency that provides bodyguards for the president. Did you know they also fight counterfeiting?

In fact, the Secret Service began almost 150 years ago, right after the Civil War. Back then, one out of every three dollars was counterfeit.

The goals are spray painted on the fence that surrounds the court. Shots whiz by like cars on a freeway.

The matches on this concrete court are quick. The first team to score wins. Losers retreat to wooden benches as the next challenger goes to play.

Existing soccer fields are beaten down from being used so much. There is no open space in city neighborhoods to build more. So futsal has rolled into parks across the nation. The game has met the growing demand of soccer-lovers in their teens and 20s.

Nearly every player prefers to play on grass. But futsal courts are seen as the best choice right now. Also, building a futsal court costs about $25,000. A real soccer field would cost 10 times as much.

Parks officials talk about courts meant for tennis, basketball or volleyball. Those areas have seen more soccer balls bounced on them than anything else in the past few years, they say. This is another sign of how the nation's growing Latino population is reshaping cities and other areas.

The dinosaur stood as tall as two building stories tall up to its shoulder. It weighed as much as seven Tyrannosaurus rex. From head to tail, it measured 85 feet, including its 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long tail.

Scientists have named it Dreadnoughtus schrani.

The dinosaur's name comes from the word "dreadnought," which means "fearing nothing." In the early 1900s, a dreadnought was a huge metal battleship.

The U.S. Supreme Court gave gay-marriage supporters a big victory on Wednesday. It said that a nationwide law that would have stopped same-sex married couples from getting government benefits was illegal.

The court also opened the door for gay marriages to start again in California.

The decisions stopped short of saying that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage. The court did not decide whether same-sex marriages from one state will have to be recognized everywhere. Twelve states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages. California is also expected to let gay people marry again.

President Barack Obama praised the court.

Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the law was against the Constitution. He also said that the real reason for the law was to make same-sex marriage less important than marriage between a man and a woman.

Doing that hurt "all who enter into same-sex marriages," Kennedy wrote.

The ruling affects immigration rights, student loans, taxes and other things controlled by the Federal government.

ATLANTA — School teachers in Georgia are saying no to guns. The state wants to make sure they are armed, but school leaders are turning the offer down. They argue that it doesn't make kids any safer and creates more problems than state lawmakers would want to solve.

Teachers could get "all the training in the world as to how to a shoot a gun, but knowing when to shoot (is) a major problem," said Steve Smith. He is superintendent of the Bibb County School District. "The folks we work with day in and day out don't have that."

The offer was part of a new law. It expands where Georgians can legally carry guns. People can now take their guns into bars and churches. The law took effect July 1.

Google's main goal is not to be a carmaker, like General Motors or Toyota. Instead, it wants to develop self-driving technology. The company said that its self-driving software will "improve road safety and help people who can't drive."

But Google plans to build most of the cars as fully self-driving. That means no steering wheel, no gas or brake pedal.

Inside the car will be two seats with seat belts and space for belongings. There will also be a screen showing where the car is going and buttons to start and stop.

The cars were built with safety in mind. They have sensors that get rid of blind spots and look in every direction for more than 200 yards. The top speed of the first cars will be only 25 miles per hour (mph).

Congress has failed to meet the deadline for approving spending bills 17 times since the 1970s. Parts of the government have shut down. The shutdowns lasted from one day to three weeks. The last time was for a 21-day stretch in December 1995 and January 1996.

Maya MacGuineas is president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The group wants lower government debt. She said a shutdown would not be as bad as people think. But, she said, "the fact that this is how we govern is so shameful."

The president and people he appointed would still report to work. Lawmakers would do the same. They would decide who on their staffs was essential.

The president has flexibility in deciding what is essential, Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told reporters. That makes it hard to predict how much of the government will shut down.

The administration would rely on a variety of documents. It would get Department of Justice legal opinions and OMB planning memos. History would also play a part.

The law requires that some agencies have to be staffed.

That means disaster aid to the Colorado flood victims would proceed but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would stop monitoring diseases. Mail delivery would continue but loan programs to small businesses, farmers and homeowners would cease. Inspectors would still regulate food and drugs but research programs would be halted. Taxes would be collected but judges would have to go home when the courts run out of money.

Even the health care law that is the point of the dispute between Republicans and Democrats would continue to be put in place. New taxes and fees help pay for that program. So do cuts from other programs.

Shoppers will spend $6.9 billion on Halloween this year, the National Retail Federation says. It is a group that represents people who run stores. That is an average of $74.34 a person. The numbers are based on a survey.

The estimated spending is down from a high of $8 billion, or $79.82 a shopper, in 2012. Still, it is more than double the Halloween spending 10 years ago.

People also love sharing online. They post photos and videos of their Halloween costumes, decorations and celebrations, experts said.

About 1 out of every 8 people used Facebook or Pinterest to look for costume ideas, the National Retail Federation said. Nearly 1-in-3 said they looked online for Halloween costumes.

"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit," especially on Facebook and Instagram, said shopper Jessica Medina. "I also search online to see what's out there and my friends post things."

Spending on Halloween is still far less than what people spend on the winter holiday season. Shoppers spend about $616 billion during the Thanksgiving and Christmas season. People also spend more on Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Father's Day.

The reason is people mostly do not give Halloween gifts, said Kathy Grannis Allen. She is a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.

Nonetheless, "it's still a huge business for a retailer," she said.

Halloween sales are expected to drop a bit this year compared with 2014. One reason is that many people are re-using older Halloween items.

People outside [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) quickly criticized the arrests. Calls for freedom for the jailed youths zipped around social media Wednesday. Williams tweeted: "It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness."

A tweet posted Wednesday evening on President Hassan Rouhani's Twitter account seemed to address the arrests. Yet, it didn't mention them directly.

The case was a reminder of the power struggle in Iran's government. The country's hard-liners are determined to keep things as they are. Iran's moderates, however, are trying to push through change. Some are seeking improved relations with Western Europe and the U.S. Others just want fewer crackdowns, like the video arrests.

Hard-liners are increasingly challenging Rouhani. The president was elected last year. He succeeded Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a more hard-line president.

"We should see the cyber world as an opportunity," Rouhani told the official Iranian news agency. "Why are we so shaky? Why don't we trust our youth?"

Bikers beware: fewer motorcycles are being stolen across the United States, but Harleys are still a target of thieves. Out of five popular brands, Harley-Davidson was the only one that had more bikes stolen in 2013.

It's hard to say why more Harleys continue to be stolen. One theory is that Harley riders are too trusting. Many leave their bikes unlocked and unattended because most fellow riders won't mess with them.

There were 3,907 Harley-Davidsons stolen in the United States in 2013. Compared with the year before, that was an increase of 4 percent.

The bar was packed with people, Bidwell said. He had just shown the motorcycle to some of them three minutes earlier.

"We parked right in front of the bar — I was 15 feet" away from the bike, he said.

"We are not going to give up until she is home," the post says.

Thousands of people have viewed the posting. Some were sure they'd seen the bike in various places.

"Someone said they thought they saw it near Nashville (Tennessee)," Bidwell said. The bike had $29,340 in add-ons and had won nine custom motorcycle contests.

"My word to everybody is 'lock up your bike,' I cannot repeat that enough," he said.

HOUSTON, Texas — Leilah Abdennabi met her friend for lunch at a cafe in Austin, Texas, recently. When she got inside, her friend was crying.

Her friend, Sirat Al-Nahi, said that an elderly white man had harassed her. He had watched Abdennabi park and suggested that she did not know how to drive. He said she "should go back to Saudi Arabia." 

The restaurant staff seated the man and his friend, and Al-Nahi started crying.

She surveyed the restaurant.

Some Muslim women are afraid of being harassed. Some women in the United States have stopped wearing headscarves. 

Abdennabi is Palestinian-American. She has worn a headscarf for six years. She knows some women who are choosing not to wear a headscarf. Abdennabi chooses to keep wearing her headscarf.

"In the beginning it's rough," Garrett said. "In the end it all pays off, because you can see all you learned and teach others."

Garrett, the Jones senior, said she plans to go to medical school. She was inspired because of her school's medical program. The 18-year-old said the classes are challenging, but that only motivates her to work harder.

"It's very stressful trying to learn everything at one time," said Garrett. She thought about leaving the program but decided: "No, I have so many people depending on me."

The teenager said doctors make a good living, and that fact has pushed her to stay with it. Doctors can earn more than $200,000 a year.

Even if Garrett chooses another job in health care, she should still be able to find a job. There are plenty of job openings now, and there will be even more in the future. In 2014, there were about two-thirds more health care jobs than in 2013. That comes to about 108,000 new jobs in just the last year.

## Hospitals Want Best And Brightest

GORDONVILLE, Pa. - Arguments over U.S. health care reform have gotten tense. They've even led to a government shutdown. But people here in rural Pennsylvania's Amish country don't worry much about all that.

In most cases, the Amish health care system depends on church aid and benefit auctions. Local hospitals often charge Amish patients less because they pay quickly and in cash.

"The way they come together to pay for health care is amazing," said Jan Bergen, chief operating officer at Lancaster General Health. "Their sense of responsibility extends beyond themselves and to the community."

The insurance exchange was set up under the Affordable Care Act, the federal health law. About 25 operators in blue shaded cubicles are talking on telephone headsets. A dozen more callers wait on hold.

"It's controlled chaos," said David Lynch, the call center manager.

## Operators Stuck With Same Delays

There are 17 call centers with more than 10,000 trained representatives. They are managed through a $530 million one-year contract with a company called Vangent. States such as Connecticut have set up their own state marketplaces. They also have their own call centers.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama's health care law has been fought over from the start. It has survived the Supreme Court, a battle for the White House and rounds of budget standoffs. Now the American people get to see how it works.

Expect the rollout to get off to a slow start. There will be some bumps.

## Insurance Iffy For Those Below Poverty Line

WASHINGTON — As a new school year begins, American parents should be thrilled to get behind first lady Michelle Obama's campaign for healthier school lunches. It is based on science and nutrition. Her goal is to make our kids healthier and happier.

The first lady wants to improve childhood health through better eating and more exercise. She wants it to be the issue she is known for.

America has a weight problem, and many people aren't just overweight — they are obese. Childhood obesity has become a national problem. In 2012, 1 in 3 American children were overweight or obese. Overweight children are at higher risk of developing a variety of diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Living with these diseases makes their lives worse and costs our nation hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

One part of Obama's overall program is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. It's an update to the national school lunch program, which has helped pay for school meals since 1946. More than 30 million students benefit from it. Yet over the past 15 years, the program hasn't changed much.

Three reservoirs usually filled with 2.75 million gallons of water this time of year are only about a third full. That little water is not enough to carry the Castle through the summer.

So it doesn't make any sense to keep topping off the famous, but leaky, outdoor Neptune Pool. Built in the 1920s, the pool has several cracks. Each day, it loses 3,000 to 5,000 gallons of water through leakage.

WATFORD CITY, N.D. — The dump truck rumbled over miles of unpaved roads. It drove past cattle and haystacks to the dirt pit.

When it arrived, truck driver Bill Gore made a signal to pile the dirt high. When the truck left, it weighed more than 100,000 pounds. Its legal limit is 82,000 pounds.

"We try to run it as hard as we can," Gore said.

These are the oil fields of Bakken, North Dakota. An oil boom is happening here. The area produces more than 1 million barrels of oil a day. Heavy trucks carry water, pipes and sand. They bring oil to pipelines and trains to ship it. They also carry dirt and construction materials.

## It's Harder To Stop Safely

Drivers described the pressure to "haul heavy." If truck drivers are paid by the hour, they do not overload the truck. But some trucking jobs pay by weight. Then truckers make more money if they overload the truck.

"We didn't come to North Dakota for the scenery. We're here for money," said truck driver Jesse Scheffler. He once got a $3,000 ticket for driving a truck that was 20,000 pounds overweight.

"There was this big, giant tub of chocolate in the factory" that was used in Milka candy bars, Prochnik said. "When nobody was looking, I'd stick my arm in up to my elbow and then lick off the chocolate."









Then the German army began hunting down Jews where they were staying. Family members used jewelry they had with them to pay smugglers to sneak them into Lithuania. There they hid in barns and filthy farm huts.

They stayed in rooms with goats and pigs, he said. "It was like coming from Beverly Hills" and living in poor people's houses in Mexico, sleeping on the floor.

One of Prochnik's older cousins got papers that let the family leave Lithuania for Russia. Then they went to Canada. But some of his Jewish school friends in Lithuania did not receive travel papers. Young Leon began having bad dreams. In the dreams, he was escaping the Nazis in a big tub of chocolate as his friends unsuccessfully tried to get in.

Another relative who had previously escaped to the West paid for the family's trip across Russia and a boat trip to Canada. Then the family moved to New York City and started a new chocolate business.

His family was never able to return to their Krakow home or the factory. German officials "claimed they had bought them from us," Prochnik said.

Once in New York City, the then-7-year-old was reassured by his parents that they were all safe. "I was no longer physically looking over my shoulder," he said. "But it took a couple of years in the United States before I stopped being afraid of the dark."













HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — When the thought of running for homecoming queen first swept through Cassidy Campbell's mind last year, she pushed the idea aside. It would just be a joke, she told herself.

On Friday, at Marina High's homecoming pep rally, the field of 10 homecoming queen candidates was thinned to five. Cassidy was one of them.

At halftime, school district spokesman Tom Delapp said, the five finalists were called up and balloons were released from a box to announce the winner.

"She kind of broke down on the podium," Delapp said of Cassidy. "She was shocked. She cried a lot."

WASHINGTON — The number of homeless children in America is at its highest ever, a new report said. There are 2.5 million children who have no home, about 1 in 30 children. These kids are often invisible. They do not always live on the streets. Instead, they may sleep on friends' couches, in all-night restaurants or hop from motel to motel.

Ten-year-old Kaylie Hegwood is hungry; so is her 12-year-old brother, Tyler. It is not because they just finished soccer practice or forgot to eat breakfast. They are hungry because their mother cannot afford to buy food.

"There's good days and bad days," Tyler told film director Jezza Neumann. "Sometimes when we have cereal, we don't have milk. We have to eat it dry. Sometimes we don't have cereal and we have milk."

Kaylie and Tyler live in Iowa with their mother.  She has a job. But after she pays the rent and monthly bills, their mother has very little money left over for groceries. Kaylie and Tyler try to help. They both collect empty cans to recycle. Tyler also mows lawns.

Todd first talked to homeless people to see if they even wanted his new signs. Some did not want his help, but others did. He started working on the new signs right away. He finished about 20 signs in two months. Creating the beautiful letters can take up many hours. It takes from 5 to 10 hours to make one sign, Todd said.

Most days, it went like this: Start classes at 8 a.m., finish up around noon, then head off to work. His life as a student at Kennesaw State University (KSU) was far from perfect, but it was manageable.

Hookah bars are getting more popular among young people. About 1 in 5 students smoked hookah in the past year, say medical researchers. Another survey found that more high school seniors are smoking hookah.

## Smoking Through A Water Bowl

"If you go into a water pipe bar, there is nothing that tells you it's dangerous," Eissenberg says.

But smoking tobacco out of a hookah is definitely not safe, recent science has shown. Hookah smoke has higher levels of dangerous substances like arsenic, tar and carbon monoxide.

Because hookah smokers inhale longer and harder than cigarette smokers, more carcinogens and nicotine can enter their lungs.

WASHINGTON – The Federal government will be trying to sell wild horses at an auction this weekend in Texas. It cannot figure out what else to do with them.

The four horses had not been visited in weeks. There was no water in their buckets, no hay in their stalls. All of the animals looked dangerously thin.

The horses' caregiver had stopped showing up. So the owner of the stable, Joyce Benes, fed them her own hay, even though they were not her animals. But last year's drought had driven up the price of hay. It increased from $2 a bale to as much as $10. Benes could not afford to keep feeding them forever.

Desperate for help, Benes called the Illinois Department of Agriculture in January. Then she waited. And waited.

## Horses Running Wild

In 2002, the Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare had 32 employees, compared with 12 now. The bureau's budget was slashed from $7 million to $4.6 million in the same time period, Squibb said.

The U.S. government and animal supporters are still fighting over plans to remove some wild horses from lands in the West.

Animal supporters say 1,300 horses are still too many. They question the BLM's reasons for taking the horses from the land.

The American Wild Horse Preservation Campaign group criticized the bureau's plans.

The falling number of crabs has led to fewer eggs. That has led to a big drop in the number of shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food.

In Florida, the government is now asking the public for help studying the crabs during their main mating season. Researchers hope more information on the crabs will help them understand their habits and count them.

"It's a really cool creature," said Tiffany Black, a biologist. "It helps people."

But in the 1990s, scientists began noticing a sharp drop in the population of a shorebird called the Red Knot. The Red Knot makes a two-week stop along the New Jersey and Delaware shores on its way to the Arctic from Argentina. The birds time their pit stop to when the crabs are breeding so that they can eat the crabs' eggs.

The crabs breed year-round in Florida. But their main mating season occurs between March and May.

In the letter, they warned that something must be done soon to get more people into the field. Or else, they said, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

Horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers and decorative plants.

But people have misconceptions, says Mary H. Meyer. She is horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota.

Horticulturists in both countries say the problem has been building for years. Partly it's because people have moved from farms to the cities, and they don't feel as connected to the land.

Timothy Cade had only owned his hoverboard for three days. Then, it exploded under him.

## Up In Flames

The bow-shaped board does not really "hover," or float above the ground. It is more like a cross between a skateboard and a Segway. It flamed and popped angrily.

The lithium ion battery can explode. This does not just happen in hoverboards. Ipods, which also use this type of battery, have gone up in flames, too.

Still, batteries in hoverboards face problems that an iPod does not. For one thing, no one is standing on and riding iPods at high speeds. Hoverboards are ridden hard. This makes their batteries more likely to get damaged.

There are no rules on how hoverboards must be made. Right now, it is easy for manufacturers to get away with making poor goods, he said.
Many people are quick to blame teachers for the problems with America's schools.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown that many students are not even mastering the basics of U.S. history and government.

For example, the most recent NAEP U.S. history exam was in 2010. It found just 12 percent of all U.S. high school seniors score at or above the "proficient" level. Being "proficient" means having a solid understanding of a subject. In other words, only 12 in 100 students understood the test and did well.

## One Village Was Not So Lucky

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Early one Saturday in August 1992, South Floridians discovered they had 48 hours to get ready for Andrew, which is called one of the nation's most wicked hurricanes.

Oklahomans got all of 16 minutes before last week's tornado. And that was more time than most past twisters have allowed.

In a game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate which disaster they'd rather have.

Hurricanes have many cons: powerful winds, vicious storm surges and damage over a wider area. But "they're the one threat we can see coming," said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Fugate was Florida's emergency manager during 2004's series of storms.

## No Excuse For Not Being Prepared

Preparation helped only a little in Moore, Oklahoma, last Monday. Monday's tornado was an EF5. EF is short for Enhanced Fujita Scale, which measure's a tornado's wind speed and damage. The scale ranges from 1 to 5. A 5 is the most powerful. Winds in the Moore tornado topped 200 to 210 miles per hour, and it was 1.3 miles wide. It was tracked on the ground for 50 minutes and its damage zone was more than 17 miles wide.

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner has said damages could top those from last year's Missouri tornado. That storm caused about $2 billion in damages.

Tornadoes cover a smaller area than hurricanes, and last just minutes. Last Monday's twister traveled 17 miles. A tornado of EF2 or more — winds of 111 to 165 miles per hour — can destroy a structure in four seconds. But only one in four tornadoes have wind speeds at 110 mph or greater. That speed would be a major hurricane.

## Killer Winds

Understanding hydrogen helps us understand the stars and planets around us.

## Sharpened Diamonds Do The Work

The structure of hydrogen began to change in important ways. It is hard to say what it looked like, but it might resemble layers of hydrogen. Scientists think they might have made the first stage of solid hydrogen.

The next step would be to raise the pressure even more. Dalladay-Simpson said that should not be too hard.

## Solid Hydrogen Could Change Technology

A new study shows that hurricanes could get even worse. The study was done by scientists Ning Lin and Kerry Emanuel. They looked at possible storms in Tampa, Florida; Cairns, Australia; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Hurricanes much worse than ever seen could hit those cities.

The chances of the storms happening are very small. In some cases, they might only happen once every 10,000 years.

Now that fisherman is more likely to be sitting comfortably in a heated and well-lit fishing shelter. Fishing holes are usually power-drilled. They used to be made by hand.

Anil, a medical student in southern India, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece. It is scarcely bigger than the head of a pin. The earpiece receives a signal from a cellphone. During exams, Anil says he conceals the transmitter under a loose-fitting shirt. He texts pictures of the test questions to a friend at home and receives answers over the phone.

"There's no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil. He sells three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students. "I've never had any problems. You just need to have some confidence and a good friend who can help you out during the exams."

The nationwide tests for 10th- and 12th-graders are called board exams. The scores on the tests decide who gets into the best colleges. The board exams are also important for getting into engineering and medicine programs. Pressure from parents to do well can be intense, students say.

But the lionfish eat almost anything. They eat fish half their own size. They're eating so much, that scientists say some are getting too fat.

SAN FRANCISCO — David Hockney is Britain's most famous living artist. These days, he is pioneering in the art world again: He is using his index finger like a paintbrush to create colorful pictures on his iPad's touch screen.

A new exhibit of Hockney's work opened Saturday in San Francisco's de Young Museum. It includes many of his iPad pictures.

The show is billed as the museum's largest ever. It fills two floors of the de Young with a survey of works from 1999 to the present. There are watercolors, charcoal sketches and even videos. But it was the iPad pieces that drew gasps. And especially the 12-foot-high majestic views of Yosemite National Park.

BAGHDAD — Earlier this month, members of the Islamic State group entered Mosul's Central Library. The mission was to destroy books containing ideas they do not like.

It is not yet known what has happened to the Central Library's materials that were removed. However, most people think the old books, newspapers and maps have probably been destroyed.

Islamic State members struck again only days after their attack on the Central Library. The new target was the University of Mosul's library. They gathered up hundreds of books and burned them in front of horrified students.

Shouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot refugee camp. It sits some 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the northern city of Irbil. The city is the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region.

WASHINGTON — Ahmed Abdulateef has a gift and a passion for music. In his hometown of Baghdad, Iraq, though, he is not free to play music. He has been threatened by men who feel his music does not fit with their strict version of Islam. His father smashed his guitar and kicked him out of the house.

For a while, Ahmed played in secret. Then he got a opportunity to join a cultural exchange program that allowed him to perform in the United States for one month.

DUBLIN, Ireland — Gay couples in Ireland began planning their weddings on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Irish people voted to change the constitution to allow gay couples to get married. The support for gay marriage was surprisingly strong. More than 6 out of 10 Irish people voted for it. Gay marriage is when two men or two women marry each other.

"We are now entering a new Ireland," Gilligan said.

After a furious firefight, the two men were rescued. But that day would change Dowling's life.

He is now part of an effort by the U.S. Special Operations Command to produce a radically new protective suit for elite soldiers to wear into battle. The goal is a suit with a range of special features: bionic limbs, head-to-toe armor, a built-in power supply and live information feeds projected inside the helmet.

BAGHDAD, Iraq — The Islamic State group has destroyed ancient monuments with bulldozers and power tools. People around the world became very angry when they saw the destruction.

## A Danger To History

Danti works with the U.S. government. He gives advice about the stolen antiquities trade from Iraq and Syria. He said some looted objects have gone to the United States and Europe. Many of them are cheaper items, such as stone seals with ancient writing on them.

### PRO: U.S. should send more troops to fight Islamic State

President Barack Obama has no choice. He will have to become a real war leader. It is the only way to defeat the Islamic State group. He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the only way to win this war.

The group, also known as ISIS, is dangerous. It threatens the United States and its friends.

## Undercutting Hatred Of The West



INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — One day, Kari Knudtson's 10-year-old son became disruptive in class. He was out of control. His teacher could not get him to calm down. Then the fourth-grader was sent to the school's isolation room. 

Schools deal with poorly behaving students in different ways. Isolation rooms are one type of consequence for kids. 

In the last few years, parents across the country have begun to protest the use of isolation rooms. Families do not like the idea of their children being held in a small room or box during the school day. 

## Some Back Use Of Isolation Space

RAMLE, Israel — Israel's school year has started, but not for thousands of Arab students. They are still on summer vacation.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20120910_Syria_profile.jpg" />SAFED, Israel — The 9-year-old Syrian boy with no legs wheeled himself down a bright hospital corridor. Along the way, he stopped to accept a pain pill from one nurse and a high-five from another.

He has been here for a month. A Syrian government warplane had flown low over his village and dropped a bomb that blew apart his lower limbs.

The civil war in Syria is still raging after nearly three years of fighting. For some time now, Israel has been quietly providing aid to some of the wounded. So far, more than 700 Syrians have received treatment.

Only the first names of the teens are being used. Kanak said they could face problems at home for taking part in the program.

REHOVOT, Israel — Israeli children returned to school Monday in a sign that life was getting back to normal after war.

In Israel, students will be eased back with two weeks of discussions about their experiences. Schools will also take part in "relaxing activities." These will help children express their feelings about the war, the Education Ministry said. Schools paid special attention to students who lost loved ones in the fighting.

President Barack Obama announced a plan to stop the ivory trade on Tuesday. The U.S. wants to strengthen the fight against the poaching business all around the world. The trade kills huge numbers of animals every year, making money for the criminals that run it.

## Endangered Elephants And Rhinos

This crackdown uses laws that have been around for many years. But these laws have not been strictly used, so once the ivory is in the U.S., sales are not really controlled.

That means that someone who sells an ivory item on eBay, for example, faces little risk of being questioned by police. This is even if they have no proof that it is legal. Some ivory items are allowed, such as antiques. These are ivory items that are more than 100 years old.

Ashe said that the legal trade provides a "smoke screen" for the sales that are not allowed. He said it also makes it more difficult for police to catch and punish the criminals.

The government won't seek to charge individual people for selling ivory. People will not be arrested for trying to sell ivory they inherited from their parents, for example. Instead, it will target the organized criminals.

President Obama also called on Congress to pass more laws. Congressman Ed Royce said he would look at the plan to check it is strong enough. Senator Dianne Feinstein wants to use stronger laws to catch people in the ivory business.

KINGSTON, Jamaica — Renaldo Brown is practicing his flute under the trees. The 12-year-old is barefoot and dressed in donated clothes. But Brown is a student at a Jamaican music school famous for teaching many of this island's top musicians.

Alpha has been a boarding school run by Catholic nuns since the late 19th century. Most of Jamaica's world-class music has come out of Alpha. The school offers hope to at-risk kids. Year after year, Alpha graduates leave Kingston to bring the sounds of Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae music to the world.

WASHINGTON — The bones of four of America's earliest leaders have been found. They were buried more than 400 years ago in a church in Jamestown, Virginia.

The four graves were uncovered in a dirt floor. The floor was once part of Jamestown's church. A team of scientists and historians announced the discovery July 28. The church is where Pocahontas, the daughter of a Native American chief, married Englishman John Rolfe. Their marriage led to peace between the Powhatan Indians and colonists at Jamestown. It was the first permanent English colony in America.

But he ended up joining his father's cleaning business. Now, the 51-year-old head janitor and handyman at Tahoma High School enjoys his job. Most of all, he loves spending days with his quirky father and his son. They also work part-time cleaning the school.

Bergum prefers to be unknown. But now he is getting some extra attention as one of 10 finalists to win national Janitor of the Year.

Cintas, the company running the contest, sorted through hundreds of people's picks for the nation's top janitor. Then they narrowed the list down to 10.

Bergum, nominated by his father and five others, is the only finalist from Washington state.

People will vote online for their choice between now and May 1. The winner will get a $2,500 check, and another $2,500 in cleaning supplies for his or her school.

Other janitors at the school said they are voting for Bergum. Some Tahoma High teachers have told Bergum that entire classrooms have voted for him.

Many children lived in the area. A new study says these children have thyroid cancer at a rate 20 to 50 times that of children elsewhere. Thyroid cancer is a disease in which cells in the thyroid gland do not grow normally.

TOKYO, Japan — Earlier this year, Shinzo Abe, the head of Japan's government, visited Egypt. He promised $200 million to help refugees fleeing war in the Middle East.

Now, a flood of refugees is entering Europe. Many people are wondering why rich Middle Eastern countries and the United States are not doing more to help. Some in Japan are also wondering if their country should be doing more than giving money.

## Open Doors To Refugees, Some Say

Japan, though, prides itself on being a good global citizen. Last year Japan gave $181.6 million to the United Nation's High Commissioner for Refugees. The group helps resettle refugees. Only the United States gave more money.

Last year, Japan accepted just 11 asylum-seekers out of 5,000, according to the Ministry of Justice. Asylum is given to people who would be in danger if they returned to their home countries. Japan accepts the fewest refugees among rich countries.

Lawyer Shogo Watanabe called these numbers "shameful."

Japanese journalist Harada Kazuyoshi wrote about the problem on Nippon.com. He said that "Japan has done less than any other large democracy" to take in refugees.

"It's a little bit lonely," said Taiki Kato, who is 11. He said he was looking forward to going to middle school next year. "It's a bit bigger and there might be kids from other elementary schools."

Five minutes from the shore, he slowed the boat and two of his crew members pulled in a net full of sea creatures. Ito grabbed a shell bigger than a man's palm, opened it with a rusty blade and rinsed it with seawater. "Yume-gaki," he said. "Dream oyster. Try it!"

Collins has received a lot of support for his essay. Just hours after the story broke, he got a call from President Barack Obama. The president praised him for his courage.

"He seems like a terrific young man, and I told him I couldn't be prouder," the president told CNN.

Collins wrote that he was not sure what other basketball players would say. So far, it seems he has nothing to fear. NBA stars Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash of the Los Angeles Lakers went to the Internet to show their support.

Tidal officials did not say how it would pay artists.

"Our goal is simple. We want to create a better service and a better experience for both fans and artists," singer Alicia Keys, one of the owners of Tidal, said at the gathering. "We believe it's in everyone's best interests to preserve the value of music."

Singer Taylor Swift was in the news last fall after she yanked her latest album "1989" from Spotify. She did not want her songs offered on the service's free version. Swift said that music should not be free. People should have to pay for listening to albums, Swift said.

Tidal is available in 31 countries. It had 500,000 paid subscribers by the end of 2014.

However, it faces heavy competition.

In November, Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, responded to musicians' criticism. He said that an artist as big as Swift could make up to $6 million a year on Spotify.

Bush soon turned serious. The presidency is something to be earned, not inherited, he said.

"Not a one of us deserves the job," the onetime Florida governor said.

"It's nobody's turn," Bush went on. "It's everybody's test, and it's wide open — exactly as a contest for president should be."

## His Family Already Had Two Presidents

Growing up, it was not very common for an Asian-American to be spending so much time playing basketball. On many of the teams I played for, I was either the only or one of very few Asian-Americans. This made me an easy target. Unfortunately, I was often mocked.

In middle school, some of the players on other teams called me a "Chinese import." They also told me to "go back to China." When I started playing basketball in college it became even more open. During some of our games, people called me hurtful names. They made fun of me by chanting Asian foods like "shrimp fried rice."

## Grateful For What I Do

William Thorpe, the athlete's 85-year-old son, was there that day. He remembers what happened as a "complete shock." He said, "We are all set to bury Dad in Oklahoma and then — boom! — he was gone, never to be returned."

William, his brother and the Sac and Fox Nation won a lawsuit in April. This demanded that the town return his father's body to the reservation.

## "You Are The World's Greatest Athlete"

It is difficult for outsiders to understand the love for the athlete from the people in this town. After all, the only thing they share is his name. But many have raised money over the years for statues of Thorpe. There is now a $60,000 statue of Thorpe throwing a discus and a $50,000 one of him with a football. They hope to add a baseball statue next.

After Jim Thorpe died, his widow Patsy had made plans with the Oklahoma governor. They included building a memorial and grave for the athlete. But then the governor changed his mind.

ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan — The Zaatari Refugee Camp used to be just empty desert.

Most of the Syrian refugees will not be going back home anytime soon. The war between the Syrian government and rebels has lasted five years.

Zaatari began on July 28, 2012. Today, Jordan, which is next to Syria, is home to 629,000 Syrian refugees. More than 100,000 live in camps in Jordan. The rest struggle to live in Jordanian cities. They get money and food from the United Nations (U.N.), an international group that helps refugees.





















## Strong Opinions On Sainthood

American kids are eating healthier, because companies are making packaged food with less calories.

Scientists suspect that our solar system developed like most others in the universe. But they also believe that it used to have more large planets. Scientists have found other solar systems that are packed with planets larger than Earth. They call these "super-earths." But those planets do not have an atmosphere like ours that can support human life. Their atmospheres are packed with hydrogen that humans cannot breathe.

CLARK STATE FISHING LAKE, Kan. — The last thing you would expect to see around Wichita, Kansas, is a fishing oasis. But that is exactly what Bluff Creek Valley is. Many Kansans call it the prettiest public fishing hole in their state.

The land around Bluff Creek Valley is steep and hard to get to. Even deer find much of the area hard to reach. The highway has sharp turns that lead cars into a valley full of tall cottonwoods and feathery willows.

Across the valley stretches 300 acres of crystal clear water.

He has high expectations when he fishes here. He said that he expects to catch a 5-pound fish every time he comes. On a recent day, Yeager and Aberson headed out for a fishing trip together. They steered the boat to a cove on the lake's western shoreline.

The first bass of the day was a chunky fish weighing nearly 2 pounds. Then Yeager and Aberson started flipping plastic lizards and crawdads into flooded vegetation. That's when things began to happen. Fish were attracted to their lures. Yeager soon jerked several bass aboard, each weighing about a pound.

He added, "I urge all Kenyans to stand together and see this dark moment through."
SAN JOSE, Calif. - NASA's Kepler spacecraft has broken down in the far reaches of the galaxy. Its planet-hunting days are probably over. But its discoveries may be yet to come.

"The signals are there, in the data we have now — we have to search for them," said NASA's William Borucki, the Kepler mission's principal investigator.

For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been focusing its lens on stars. It was watching for the slight dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of its sun. The passes are called "transits."

Kepler would have collected so much information that scientists would have been sure they found signs of an Earth-like planet if the spacecraft lasted until  2019, the researchers said.

Some people have asked the U.S. government to accept 100,000 Syrian refugees. Germany says it will accept as many as 1 million Syrians this year.

Imagine for a moment that all of the nation's fast-food restaurants vanished overnight. All the drive-thru windows, the dollar deals and the odor of french fries — gone! Would there be far fewer overweight kids?

The answer is very likely no. At least that is what a study published this week says. Children who frequently eat at fast-food restaurants will go home and still eat unhealthy foods. They'll gobble cookies and chips. They will chug sugar-sweetened soda from a bottle. They'll heat up frozen pizzas.

Researchers from the University of North Carolina studied the issue. They were led by nutrition professor Barry Popkin.

Life is not fair.

That is something that children seem to understand at a young age. However, how children develop a sense of what is fair and what is unfair, and how they act on that sense, has been a puzzle for scientists.

The Canary Islands used to be a stable ecosystem. The islands are just off the coast of northwestern Africa. The animal species living there were balanced. But then, the California kingsnake arrived and grew in numbers. Now, the reptiles are killing off the islands' own birds, mammals and lizards.

On a hot day in Australia, a koala's thick fur makes it hard to stay cool. The over-heated koalas don't seek shelter and water can be hard to find. In the wild, many koalas die when the heat becomes extreme. This is according to a report published Wednesday.

The scientists guessed that koalas must do something to cool down in hot weather. So they put radio collars on 37 koalas in southeastern Australia. They tracked the koalas during the winter and summer. In Australia, summer lasts from December to March.

The researchers recorded what the koalas did. They noted their body position and checked whether they liked high or low branches. The scientists measured the air temperature a couple of feet from the koalas.

The scientists also observed 130 koalas without collars.

They discovered that koalas behaved differently on hot days than on cooler days. In the summer, the animals stretched out. A larger part of their bodies were in contact with the trees. They also often hugged a tree trunk or branch closer to the ground. In the winter, koalas climbed higher up the tree and farther out onto the branches.

Bryant often has been hurt playing basketball. In the last three years, he had to end the season early because of injuries. In the last two years, he played only 41 games. So far this season, he has made just one out of every three of his shots and has been in pain every day. Before Sunday's game, many fans took pictures of Bryant warming up. Then he missed his first six shots.

## Future Plans Are Not Clear

Bryant intends to keep going.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Caltech_Prototype_Toilet_Room_View_1.jpg" />A group of students in California are working with bathroom product company Kohler to reinvent the toilet.

This might lead you to laugh. Don't. It's not funny, and the fact that nice people don't talk about human waste makes an enormous problem even worse.

In India, for example, the United Nations estimates that more than 600 million people don't use toilets. They don't use pits, called latrines, either. They go on the ground.

And that's just one country. There have been big improvements in the past 20 years, but an estimated 1 billion people worldwide still go out in the open. Another 700 million use unclean types of bathrooms. Some use "hanging latrines" that dump directly into streams, or buckets that are simply emptied in the streets.

When the waste is disposed in that way, it can get into water and make it dirty. When people drink the dirty water it can cause diarrhea, which kills as many as 1.5 million people each year. The majority of those deaths are from water made dirty by human waste. Most of the victims are under 5 years old.

But Kohler is one of the world's biggest makers of plumbing products. In 2011 the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced its "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge." The foundation was started by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates and gives the most money of any foundation. That made Kohler take notice.

It's been a long time since the toilet changed much. The modern flush toilet works in about the same way as the one invented in the late 1500s by Sir John Harington. He was a witty English writer who installed one of his toilets in a palace for Queen Elizabeth I.

"That's very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an engineer who grew up in a village in Africa's Ivory Coast. He works at the Gates Foundation. "It will work in very few (developing world) cities."

The Caltech toilet went on to win the Gates challenge in 2012. Hoffmann and his students prepared to fine-tune the original model and get it ready for field testing in India, set to begin later this year.

Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese — that favorite food of kids found in the famous blue box — will soon be free of yellow dye. Kraft announced Monday that it will remove artificial food coloring, including Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 dyes, from its Mac &amp; Cheese by 2016. Instead, the pasta will maintain its bright yellow color by using natural ingredients: paprika, turmeric and annatto, which comes from a type of seed.

The company said it decided to pull the dyes because more customers want natural foods. But claims have also risen that the dyes may be linked to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. ADHD is a condition that makes kids hyperactive and have problems paying attention.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is the government agency responsible for making sure food and medicines in America are safe. It says artificial food dyes are safe. However, some studies have found the dyes can contribute to hyperactive behavior in children. People have debated about the safety of food dyes since the 1970s. But no one can agree on the extent of this risk or the correct path to address it.

So far, only a handful of patients have received the London-made body parts. They include veins and windpipes, as well as tear ducts — the part of the eyes where tears come out. Researchers hope they will soon be able to attach even more body parts. One of their goals is to make the world's first nose using stem cells. These are cells in the body that can be made into blood cells or skin cells.

POWELL, Wyo. — On this moonlit autumn night, cars arrive at Wyoming's last drive-in theater. Pokey Heny is waiting there ready for another evening of entertainment in this small town.

Heny, 52, is the owner of the American Dream Drive-in. She collects $15 from each vehicle as they enter. She greets people by their first names, telling a 4-year-old girl she likes her stuffed hippo, named Martha. Then a mother and daughter roll up in an old truck. Heny lets them in for 10 bucks.

She looks out toward the big screen in the night. She sees families on top of cars, in lawn chairs and the backs of trucks. Dogs crouch between toddlers buried under wool blankets. And she smiles because she knows she's helping to preserve an important custom in this town. Powell is a town of ranchers and has just 6,000 people.

Heny's business first opened in 1949 as Wyoming's first drive-in. But, the future is in doubt as Heny battles Hollywood movie studios seeking to increase their profits. In the background lurks the shrinking popularity of drive-ins as they close one by one. Hers is the last one standing in Wyoming.

Along the way, the family moved from a poor neighborhood to a rich one. They were the first Latinos in their area. Now there are four other Latino families there.

The Garcias are a success story. Not all Latinos have done as well.

A study last year found that younger Mexican-Americans have done better than their parents. In California and Texas, they were better educated and made more money. They also held better jobs and are more likely to own their own homes. Only about one out of five Mexican parents had finished high school. By 2005, four out of five of their children did.

BEIRUT — In a bar in Beirut, Lebanon, Nasser Shorbaji and Marwan Alameh try not to knock over their microphones. They're laughing during their weekly radio show.

Moments later, they turn more serious as they play Palestinian hip-hop. The discussion turns to the war in the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Palestinians and Israelis have been fighting there. Heads nod in the packed bar to the rhymes of a Palestinian rapper.

Jackson Allers is an American journalist in Beirut who writes about Arab hip-hop. Allers believes Lebanese artists are just beginning to discover how much power they have.

"Their influence is increasing," he said.

Ali Rafei, 28, is a graffiti and street artist from Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city. Since civil war began in neighboring Syria, fighting has spilled over into Tripoli.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — It is summer in the city of Beirut located on the Mediterranean Sea. Mountains of stinking garbage are piling up in the streets.

This week, the citizens of Lebanon's capital finally had enough.

## Water, Electricity Problems Have Lingered For Years

The "You Stink" movement quickly picked up supporters and expanded its demands beyond just getting rid of the garbage. It says the entire government should quit.

The "You Stink" movement says it will not back down.

Marwan Maarouf is with the group. He said the movement has stirred the Lebanese people to take action. "We will not let them make us go to sleep again," he said.

Maarouf called for a large protest Saturday. Another protest can be risky for the country, which is already trying to deal with thousands of refugees from the Syrian war.

"You Stink" canceled a planned protest Monday, but hundreds of people again gathered in downtown Beirut after sunset. The protests were peaceful.

James thought about Roosevelt's words during and after the 2010-2011 basketball season. The season was his first with the Miami Heat. James was criticized for leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he got his start, and joining the Miami team. In Miami, James posted Roosevelt's words on his locker in large letters.

Tyson Chandler is a basketball player with the Dallas Mavericks. He won a gold medal with James in the 2012 Olympics. Chandler said there are not many players that start so young and understand how important they are to their team and city.  "With that comes a lot of responsibility and he's never (avoided) it," Chandler said.

Finch used to be a middle-school teacher. Now she lives with her family near Seattle. She is an AFOL, or Adult Fan of Lego. AFOLs call a Lego work a "build." Her Hogwarts build was shown at BrickCon 2012. BrickCon is a meeting for those who love Lego. It happens every year in Seattle. Her castle won two prizes there.

Mikaila is in charge of BeeSweet Lemonade. It is a company she started when she was just 4.

Lemonade Day teaches kids about how to run a business, said Peggy Bessellieu. She is the head of Lemonade Day Greater Dallas. Lemonade Day also teaches them about money. They learn the skills they need to become successful in all areas of their lives.

For example, kids learn to figure out how much it costs to make lemonade.

Then two important events happened to her at about the same time.

The number of new leprosy cases in the world was around 10 million in 1991. But last year it was around 230,000. Countries increased their efforts to fight the disease. In India, hospitals began treating patients with a mix of medicines that essentially kills the germ that causes leprosy.

In 2005, India declared victory. But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy.

Leprosy can take "five years to 15 before the first signs become detectable. And by then, many others could become infected," said P.K. Gopal. He works with a group that helps leprosy patients.

The government is stepping up its fight against the disease. It is sending health workers to 209 districts seen as high areas of leprosy. But that won't end the pain and shame that leprosy brings to patients and their families.

## In Leprosy's Shadow

During the world's worst outbreak, more people died of Ebola in Liberia than any other nation.

Patients often thought they had other illnesses, such as typhoid or malaria. Many of them tragically delayed seeking treatment, infecting others.

Treatment centers were swamped with cases, and patients often died at the gates. Often, there was no room inside the overcrowded centers to treat them safely.

Taxis bringing sick passengers for treatment may also have spread the disease.

To help stop the spread of the virus, schools were closed and public gatherings were banned. Ambulances had a hard time reaching patients.

MIAMI — Christina Morua sat in her library's busy children's section. She was waiting for her fourth-grade daughter to get on a library computer and start her homework.

"We don't have any Internet at home," Morua said. Her oldest child, 11-year-old Abel, was doing his homework on a library laptop. Alina, 9, had just reserved a desktop. Her wait time was 70 minutes.

"The laptops we do have, the batteries aren't working," said Patricia Readon. She is a children's librarian. "The sad part is, if you don't have a computer, you can't do your homework."

For families without Internet, libraries are the place to be on school nights. Parents complain, though, that there are not enough computers.

Silvia Diaz is an official with the Miami-Dade school system. She said teachers should assign online homework only if all students in a class have Internet access at home.

"We really shouldn't be requiring kids to go to the library to complete assignments," Diaz said. "A project or something special is OK." She added that daily homework assignments that depend on the computer are not OK.

Then she saw the Teen Tech Center at the Minneapolis Central Library. The center has rows of new computers and iPads. It has the latest video equipment. It even has its own recording studio.

"Growing up, I used to be super into reading. That's what I thought libraries were for," said Yakob, 18. Now she is a member of the library's Teen Tech Squad. As a member of the tech squad, she helps other kids use the latest technology.

Shhhhhhh. You may not know it, but libraries have become community tech centers. They don't just offer computers with free Internet. They have 3-D printers, e-readers and social media. Growing catalogs of e-books let people connect to libraries from home.

Library visitors wouldn't have it any other way.

People value the Internet almost as highly as books. This is according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. Most people who go to the library said that borrowing books was "very important." About the same number said free Internet also was "very important."

"They come and ask me for e-book help. They usually end up with a little bit more," said Andrea Egbert. She works for the Anoka County library system. Some people walk in with new e-readers, still in the box. They don't know how to turn them on. Others ask how to share photos and videos online.

Italian and Maltese vessels continue to search the area, along with merchant ships.

Passengers came from Algeria, Egypt, Somalia, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Bangladesh and Ghana. They included 200 women and 40 to 50 children.

Many passengers were locked in lower decks and were unable to escape when the boat capsized. With so many people crammed on board, the ship was easily unbalanced.

Most migrants who make the risky Mediterranean voyage are from Africa. However, some are Syrians and others escaping warfare and poverty. Many women and children are among those risking the hazardous passage.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi declared that Europe was experiencing "slaughter in the Mediterranean."

"Europe can do more and Europe must do more," said Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament.

LOS ANGELES — Humans speak many languages, and can have a hard time understanding each other. But we may express how we don't understand things in much the same way. A new study examined languages from around the world and discovered what could be a global word: "Huh?"

Scientists traveled to cities and tiny villages on five continents. They visited people who spoke 10 very different languages. Their nearly 200 recordings of casual conversations showed that there are forms of "Huh?" in every language they studied. They word even sounds nearly the same.

The word "Huh?" may not even seem like a word. But the team discovered that it is the glue that holds a broken conversation together. Their findings were published Friday in the journal PLOS ONE. The fact that the word appears over and over reveals a remarkable case of languages developing independently, but in much the same way, they added.

SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — Kathryn "Tubby" Johnston Massar cut off her braids and tucked her hair under her cap. She made herself look like a boy to become the first girl to play Little League baseball. That was more than 60 years ago. Today she's thrilled to see two girls in the Little League World Series.

"It's truly amazing. I'm very happy to see girls playing," Massar said. She is now 78 years old.

Humans are tidal breathers. When we breathe in, the air moves into our lungs along small airways. It ends up in little sacs called alveoli, where our bloodstream picks up oxygen. The blood leaves carbon dioxide behind. The "old" air then moves out of our lungs along the same path it came in.

Colleen Farmer is a professor at the University of Utah. She said that because only one part of the lung was dark, it showed that the air was just flowing in one direction. This black bit of the lung was the first part to receive the dirty air. It then cleaned the smoke from the air.

Birds could have developed this breathing system for many reasons. Scientists think it might help them to turn food into energy very quickly. It could also help them when they fly at high altitudes. The higher the birds fly, the less oxygen there is in the air. Farmer published a study in 2010 which showed that alligators also breathe in just one direction.

The fight is part of the growing split between London's rich and poor people.

The American Museum of Natural History has a new animal visitor. The museum has a collection of extinct animals that died off because of environmental causes or human actions that harmed them. Joining the display of sloths and small horses that have vanished from the Earth is a giant tortoise nicknamed Lonesome George.

The scientists decided to hire a taxidermist named George Dante, who had worked with the museum before, doing taxidermy on brown bears and other animals.

The announcement Tuesday by the museums was a bombshell. It also raises a question: Why has it taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections after World War II? It also suggests that even more looted art may show up in countries that have not done such investigations.

The art included 69 paintings. One of them is French artist Henri Matisse's 1921 "Odalisque." It is a painting of a half-nude reclining woman. The painting hangs in Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum. The museum is very popular with tourists.

The examination also found other paintings by well-known painters. Other pieces uncovered included drawings, like one by Paul Klee. There were also sculptures, old collectors pieces and Jewish ceremonial objects.

One painting had been purchased in good faith by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002. The 1627 painting had changed hands many times over the years. Then the latest Dutch examination revealed it had belonged to a Jewish woman. It was sold by a bank. That bank had worked with the Nazis during the war.

In 1998, there was an international conference on looted art.  The Washington meeting found past attempts to return looted art didn't go far enough. Attendees from 44 nations set up the Washington Principles. They declared that "every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been" taken by the Nazis, and have it returned.

Some wondered what took so long.

But some countries are less willing than others. Russia does not accept the Washington Principles. It calls art taken during World War II its rightful "trophies." Switzerland endorses the principles in theory, but has not conducted thorough research and ignores the idea that looted art could be hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.

The Dutch Museums Association launched a website on Tuesday. The site will show what the museums have discovered so far, and ask for more information about looted artwork. It will help relatives or others in filing claims. An English translation of the Dutch website is coming in 2014.

Investigator Rudi Ekkart admitted it's still possible that more looted artwork will be uncovered in the Netherlands. He said the museums' research was not complete and new research ideas — such as the website — will lead to new findings. In addition, there are likely pieces still held in homes that will be eventually detected.

But "you'll never again have a hundred at once," Ekkart said.

LOS ANGELES — Forty years ago this month, one of our oldest ancestors was discovered. Lucy was about 3 feet, 6 inches tall and walked the Earth 3.5 million years ago. The discovery forever changed science's understanding of where the earliest humans came from.

Johanson is now the director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. He spoke about Lucy's effect on paleoanthropology and what he hopes to find next. Paleoanthropology is the study of early humans through examining their fossilized bones and footprints.

We also have areas all over Africa that have not been thoroughly explored. I think new discoveries will be made that will be surprising.

CHICAGO — November was Lung Cancer Awareness Month, but you'd never know it. In October, NFL players or coaches wore pink for breast cancer. Some people say the color blue should be worn to support the cause to stop lung cancer. No one in the NFL wore blue in November.

The lack of attention is especially strange because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. It claims more lives than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. Only about one out of every six people who get it live more than five years.

## "Magnets Cause More Damage"

Eventually the magnets can make a hole in the intestines. This can cause an infection, Mehta said.

The problem shows no sign of slowing down, she said.

"There is something very tempting about" magnets, Brown said. "You want to put it in your mouth. You want to try to separate the magnets with your teeth."

To toddlers, they look like the little silver-ball sprinkles on cupcakes, she said.

Buckyballs is a set of 216 magnets. People can stick them together to make things. Last year, a product safety group said Buckyballs should not be sold.

But you can still find them online. And Brown said that more than 3 million magnet sets have been sold.

Other products with magnets are also a problem, she said. One example is bulletin boards with little magnet pins. There also are refrigerator magnets that look like candy.

ABUJA, Nigeria — In 2012 [Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), a Pakistani teen, survived being shot by the Taliban. She had been targeted for defending the right of girls to go to school. On Monday, Malala celebrated her 17th birthday with a visit to the African country of Nigeria.

## An Emotional Meeting

When activists tried to march peacefully to the president's home in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police. Jonathan canceled a planned trip to Chibok that same month.

On Monday, the president told Malala that those who think his government is not doing enough are "very wrong."

The "great challenge," he said, is making sure the girls "are rescued alive."

[Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala) is back in class. The 15-year-old girl was shot in the head by the Taliban last fall. Now she is attending a new school in England.

Malala got better from surgery fast. Doctors put a metal plate in her skull and gave her an implant to help her hearing. After only five months in the hospital, she was strong enough to return to school. Malala showed it will take more than a bullet to keep her out of class.

"I am excited that today I have achieved my dream of going back to school," Malala told Time magazine. "I want all girls in the world to have this basic opportunity. I miss my classmates from Pakistan very much, but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and making new friends here in Birmingham."

Malala is already bringing change. She became famous in Pakistan and beyond while she was only 12. She wrote a popular blog about her experiences as a schoolgirl. She lived in the Swat Valley, a region of Pakistan. When Malala was writing, Swat was under Taliban control. The Taliban did not want girls to go to school. They began bombing girls schools. But Malala wanted to go to school. So she stood up to the Taliban's threats to ordinary people.

In a place called Malaysian Borneo, people are getting a form of a disease that used to be found only in monkeys. Now scientists say they may know why. In a magazine for scientists and doctors, scientists say that cutting down trees in the rain forest is to blame. Clearing trees is changing the forest, and that is spreading a disease called malaria.

POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE, Calif. — The oyster farm at the end of the dirt road looked as if it had suddenly been abandoned.

Doors and windows were wide open. Buildings were stripped of everything that was valuable. Inside, the mud-covered floors were cluttered with what was left from the oyster farm: a shopping cart, fishing poles, plastic gloves, office chairs.

Farmers had groomed crops of oysters in the clear waters of Drakes Estero for years. Now, bits of yellowed plastic foam that had broken off a floating barge bobbed in the water.

This was what remained after a court battle between the oyster farmer and the National Park Service. The National Park Service fought to take back the Estero. It won after several years and spending millions of dollars in lawsuits.

## Wilderness In Waiting

The Estero's 2,500 acres are a natural refuge for seals. But they are believed to have moved to other areas to avoid the oyster farm's motorboat traffic.

Once the area is restored, scientists think seals might come back to the Estero.
VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. — A newspaper that the famous writer Mark Twain wrote for more than 100 years ago is back in business.

Even the Enterprise's new editor, Elizabeth Thompson, guesses that he would have had some fun.

"He'd have something to say," she said. "He'd get a kick out of it."

The newspaper sold as many as 15,000 copies in the 1860s when it was most popular. The Enterprise was Nevada's first newspaper. It was also the largest west of the Mississippi River. Its reporters wrote about the craziness and the money issues that came with the discovery of silver on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson. The silver was called the Comstock Lode.

The mining business eventually died out, but the paper kept running. Its reporters told the story of the town, a tough place where grimy men settled arguments with guns.

Twain had traveled west from Missouri with his brother, Orion Clemens. Orion helped run Nevada before the area became a state in 1864. Historians say Samuel Clemens first used the name "Mark Twain" while at the Enterprise.

The history of Mars is written in its many layers of rock. Curiosity set out to discover this history. The rover was planning to visit Mount Sharp, a 3-mile-high mountain.

## Signs Of Carbon Still Missing

A recent series of discoveries is making scientists change their ideas about Mars: They now suspect that the Red Planet may be more Earth-like than previously imagined. New information suggests that Mars may have small bits of water spread around its surface.

Curiosity used another of its tools to cook up a tiny sample of soil in a little oven: It turned out that roughly 1.5 to 3 percent was made of water. The scientists think this water may have come from the atmosphere. In other words, it might have been pulled out of Mars' thin air.

Like past mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Garcetti speaks Spanish. But it's a kind of Spanish that might be called Funky American Business Spanish.

Villaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots. But both had to learn much of their Spanish in school or on the job. They speak a little Spanish, but it's far from perfect. Both have approached their lack of skill with good humor. During a 2009 visit to Mexico City, Villaraigosa referred to himself jokingly as "el pochito." "Pocho" is slang for an Americanized Mexican who may not speak Spanish well.

## Mayor's Mexican Roots

At a news conference Monday, the mayor was able to answer questions in Spanish. He talked about the two cities' shared challenges and his mixed Jewish-Latino background. His answers were also full of the kinds of little mistakes that his 11th-grade Spanish teacher would have marked in red pen.

At one point, he appeared to have invented a word: "agrecimiento," to mean "acuerdo," or "agreement." Moments later, he stuck the English word "between" in the middle of a Spanish sentence. Later, making a reference to the "social fabric," Garcetti said what sounded like the "fabrica social" (in Spanish, "el tejido social"), which could be translated as "the social factory."

Want a burger off a fast-food dollar menu? Better have more than a dollar.

McDonald's is changing its Dollar Menu. The menu offered burgers, fries and other items for less than a dollar apiece for more than 10 years. The menu is popular. McDonald's gets as much as one-seventh of its U.S. sales from the Dollar Menu.

But soon, the list will change. McDonald's is calling it the Dollar Menu &amp; More. It will have the standard $1 items. But there will also be $2 food and $5 family meals.

The fast-food giant isn't the only one making a change.

## No More Super-Cheap Deals

McDonald's says it will start giving customers the choice of a salad, fruit or vegetable. They would be with its value meals instead of french fries.

McDonald's will roll out the change early next year in the United States. People will not have to pay more to pick a salad instead of fries. McDonald's says it already lets customers make such swaps in other countries.

But now it says it will work to make the choice available in 20 of its biggest markets around the world. McDonald's gets 85 percent of its sales from those markets. McDonald's has more than 34,000 restaurants around the world. It said the change will be in place in 30 to 50 percent of the areas within the next three years. It will be in all of the regions by 2020.

McDonald's partner in Vietnam has a uniquely American experience. Henry Nguyen is an investor who studied medicine and business at Northwestern University. He worked at the Golden Arches as a teenager.











Nguyen's bet is a sign of a big change underway in Vietnam. The country has made it easier for big companies to come into Vietnam since 2007.

"It's a market we've wanted to get into, and one of the things was finding the right partner," said Mike Flores. He is a McDonald's executive who develops restaurants around the world.

"I've had so many friends, colleagues and others ask, 'Why isn't there a McDonald's here?' " Nguyen said. "'Do they think there's something wrong with Vietnam?' "













WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court has given gay couples the right to marry across the country. Its decision last Friday marked a huge change in law, and created the most important new liberty in years.

Obama said the decision declares what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: "that when all Americans are treated as equal, all are free."

Rainbow Sky Buck moved to the state of Utah this summer. Soon after, she went to the hospital with a painful ear infection. While she was at the hospital, she got some bad news. The state of Utah would not pay for her to see the doctor. In fact, it would not pay for any of her care if she did not feel well.

"We really do feel an urgency about this," said Shadi Houshyar, who works for the group. "So many people who have aged out have significant health needs and coverage is so important."

Martinez worries that she might lose her free health care. She has several health problems that need to be treated. "It is causing foster youth to be stuck in the same state they were raised in," Martinez said. "It is really stressing me out."

Buck, who moved from California to Utah, thought finding a job would be easier in her new state. She said she was shocked to learn she would no longer get free health care.

Buck has stopped seeing one of her doctors and no longer takes her medication because she can no longer afford it. She also worries about getting another ear infection. If she does, she might not be able to pay for treatment.

"It is just scary to think I am completely on my own," Buck said. Not long ago, she found a new job, but it does not pay for health care. "I don't want to leave, but this is almost forcing me to move back to California."

On a rainy Saturday in March, 65 of them gathered in a Manhattan office tower for the 17th USA Memory Championship. The competition is one of several contests held each year around the world. It went on for nearly eight tense hours. Competitors scrambled to rearrange playing cards, match names with faces of strangers, and remember random numbers. They had to memorize a 25-line poem and write it down word for word.

There were dentists, students, nurses, teachers, writers and magicians, ranging in age from 16 to 50. They seemed to have little in common beyond their love for memorization and their difficult training methods, which usually involve sitting in isolation for several hours a day practicing.

Most give visual images to just about everything. Then they create places in their minds to store those pictures, which serve as memory triggers.

When Yang needs to recall something, she envisions walking the path, which she models after a familiar place. In her mind, she stops at particular locations to pick up the correct cookie crumbs.

Images, when tied together, can lead to fantasy-like pictures.

The first New York contest, in 1997, drew 18 players. The winner was Tatiana Cooley, a secretary who joined the competition minutes before it began. Last year, Ram Kolli, a businessman from Los Angeles, beat the reigning champion, mountaineer Nelson Dellis, who had won the previous two years.

Other winners have included Ron White and Scott Hagwood. White is a war veteran who has won twice, and memorized the name and rank of every U.S. service member killed in Afghanistan. Scott Hagwood competed after doctors warned that the radiation treatment he had for his cancer could hurt his memory.

PITTSBURGH — A long list of schools have been struck by violent student attacks in recent years. Officials say to prevent killings at schools, students should be taught alternatives to violence. Mental-health services, such as counselors, should be made more available.

But officials say limiting school violence has been held back by a lack of money. At the same time, school-safety programs haven't worked. Schools have failed to properly train teachers and students, they say.

"We're 15 years after Columbine, and you'd have thought we would have solved that problem," said John Matthews, who runs the Community Safety Institute in Texas. He's referring to the 1999 rampage at Columbine High School in Colorado. In that attack, seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fatally shot 12 students and a teacher. Then the two killers took their own lives.

A new Vanderbilt University study suggests teaching younger students "conflict-resolution skills." Such skills would help kids to think before they act. The study found this could have more success than other methods for reducing violence.

Before the study, the students completed a list of questions regarding their beliefs about violence and ability to manage explosive situations. Over several weeks, students tried role-playing exercises. The idea was that they learn how to avoid violence at heated moments. They worked through scenarios including when one student calls another a name, or hits on someone's girlfriend.

Sethi said the exercises helped students in "understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."

After the exercises, students filled out a second list of questions. Students reported that they were less likely than before to be a target of bullying, and less likely to hit or push others. They were also less likely to cheer if a fight broke out and more likely to try to prevent a fight.

Schools may be able to identify students who seem troubled. Yet, even then students often don't get the help they need, especially not regularly and for a long enough time, Matthews said. He said Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and himself during a 2007 shooting rampage at Virginia Tech, received care and monitoring at home.

"When he went to college, that was all out the door, and you saw that downward spiral," Matthews said.
MIAMI — After a 15-year-old Illinois boy found out his father had cancer, he spun out of control. He skipped school, yelled at teachers and punched holes in walls. Stunned by an overwhelming sadness, he sometimes hid in his room.

School violence appears to be on the increase. Yet, experts say many teens are struggling with mental illness that is not being treated -- or even identified.

MEXICO CITY — When tax time comes, artist Teresa Cito doesn't worry. She knows the government isn't after a single peso.

In Mexico, artists are allowed to give pieces of art instead of money.

Siegmann said she got a thrill when she saw one of her pieces in a public space.

## Can There Be Too Much Art?

Of course, not every artist who makes a living from selling his or her work is enormously talented. Bad artists, too, have a right to take part in the program.

Still, the overall collection contains many great works. They come from some of Mexico's most famous artists.

MEXICO CITY — Violent drug gangs have brought Mexico international attention. But now the government is focusing on another form of violence: school bullying.

President Enrique Pena Nieto spoke against [bullying](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) during a visit to a Mexican state with a violence problem, Tamaulipas. Mexican celebrities spoke out on Twitter. They held signs with the hashtag "#ElBullyingNoEsUnJuego," or "Bullying is not a game."

MEXICO CITY — Young Americans wanting to study in Latin America have stopped looking to Mexico. A decade ago it was the No. 1 place for U.S. students to attend a university in the region. Now it's in fourth place.

Only about 4,000 U.S. students now study in Mexico. Crime and drug violence have discouraged students from heading there. More go to Costa Rica, Argentina and Brazil.

MEXICO CITY — When you look through the magazines celebrating Mexico's high society, there is one thing you will rarely find: dark-skinned people.

Mexico has strong laws against treating people worse because of their skin color or national background. But publicity firms and the news media lag behind. They promote the idea that light skin is better and dark skin unappealing.

The issue came up this month. Mexico's largest airline wanted to make a commercial. The ad asking for people to try out to be in it specifically asked for  "no one dark." The Internet buzzed with outrage.

"It's the first line of evidence something had really changed here in terms of sea level," archaeologist Bob Carr said. Carr was speaking at the Met Square construction dig on downtown Miami's Fourth Street. His team is there to dig up a 2,000-year-old Tequesta Indian village. The village lies buried on land where a hotel and other buildings are being built.

On Wednesday, lawmakers in Washington got a step closer to tightening gun laws. Meanwhile, first lady Michelle Obama sat down with Chicago students. Their stories about violence brought her to tears.

According to the students, the first lady wanted to know how many of them had been affected by the gun violence. Every one of them told her they had, said 16-year-old Ta'taleisha Jones. "She said, 'Have you ever experienced a family member hurt or killed?' I told her, 'Yeah.' When she was talking about how her life was and how we changed her, she got real emotional. I was like 'Wow, we see the first lady crying.' Tears were coming out her eyes," said Ta'taleisha. Another student confirmed that the first lady cried at the meeting.

SEATTLE, Wash. — Anand Mariappan works at Microsoft in Seattle, Washington. He helps develop software and tools for computers. He spends his day at work building computer programs for customers. The people who use the software that Mariappan makes usually have fancy computer screens, quick Internet and modern office buildings.

The program has faced some challenges. Not every project they work on goes well. In the program's early days, Microsoft pushed African customers to use an inexpensive smartphone that ran on Windows software. Customers did not run out and buy the phone. It was not popular. Google and Apple are make the world's most popular smartphones. Microsoft could not keep up with the competition. The smartphone in Africa was not as successful as the company wanted it to be.

RAMALLAH, West Bank — When Sari Sakakini started his new restaurant, he dreamed of opening Palestinian eateries around the world. A year later, he does not have much hope.

Among the many Jews who tried to escape Europe were Otto Frank and his family. His wife was Edith, and his daughters were named Anne and Margot. Anne was the author of "The Diary of Anne Frank." The family was never able to leave and come to the U.S.

BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hundreds of migrants protested outside Budapest's main train station Wednesday. For the second day, Hungarian police had stopped them from traveling to Germany and other wealthy European countries.

So far, the EU has not been able to agree on how to deal with the migrants to Europe. More than 332,000 have entered so far this year. Greece, Italy and Hungary, which are seeing the most migrants, have pleaded for more help. Meanwhile, Germany has demanded that other nations accept more migrants. Germany expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year, the most in Europe.

Hungary's police said they will put more officers outside the Keleti station. About 3,000 migrants already are camped nearby. Police are also looking for migrants on Hungarian trains.

Hungary is building a 13-foot-high fence on the border with Serbia. It also plans to pass stricter migration laws. These would let officials make quicker decisions about who can come into the country and who cannot. The laws would also stop migrants from cutting through the new fence or crossing the border except in certain places.

The Greek coast guard, meanwhile, said it had rescued 1,058 migrants over the past 24 hours. More than 200,000 migrants have reached Greece this year. They have come mainly from neighboring Turkey. More than 1 million people live in refugee camps there, fleeing from wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Greek police also arrested six suspected people in northern Greece. They are accused of trying to smuggle 103 migrants, including 19 children, over the border in a truck.

Zaidah and his group already know which border points they will cross. They also know hotels they can stay in and stores where they can get warm clothing.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The nation's economy continues to get better. There are more jobs and people are earning more money. People are also heading to Southern and Western states where they hope to find work and housing that they can afford.  

CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. — In the past, the Marine Corps branch of the U.S. military did not encourage its soldiers to have families. Now that has changed.

For example, the base's grocery store sells food and other things for a lot less than grocery stores off the base.

The government has closed more than 350 military bases in the United States in the last 20 years. Those 350 bases were combined into fewer, larger bases. This allowed for the remaining bases to run better than before. It also helped the government to save money.

The communities that live near these mega-bases are usually made up of people who work with the military.

However, some experts worry about how separate the military bases are.

Steve Erie, another professor, thinks that Americans respect the military, even if they do not join themselves.

## Questions Are Being Asked

This year, the Defense Department program is being reconsidered. Normally, there would have been little argument about continuing it.

Now, things are different. Carl Levin is the Michigan Democrat who heads the  Senate Armed Services Committee. On Friday, he said the program needed to be reviewed. Congress needs "to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended," he said.

They think anybody can join. Many see the military as a last resort in a tough job market. Young people always assume it is an option.

## Military Spending Cuts

## Expects High Scores

The number "of military-age young men, who qualify for the military, is declining," said General Martin Dempsey. The general made his comments on National Public Radio (NPR).

According to the NPR report, too many young men cannot join the military. Some are barred because they have had trouble with the law. Others lack a high school diploma. Drug use is another reason many young men fail to qualify.

That is part of the reason the military decided to let women serve in combat. By opening up combat roles to women, it hopes more women will apply. The change shows that women can do anything in the military, just like men.

Combat roles can involve tanks, heavy weapons and ground fighting. They were previously off-limits to female troops. The jobs are tough and dangerous. But serving in combat can lead to a promotion.

Still, allowing women to serve in combat by itself cannot solve the headcount problem. Earning a spot in a combat unit is hard. Servicewomen will have to pass a very tough training course. They will need to be as fit as possible.

Poor fitness keeps many men and women from joining the military. More than a quarter of Americans aged 17 to 24 are too heavy to serve.

The U.S. military cannot respond to threats if it does not have enough troops. Nor can it accomplish its missions.

LOS ANGELES — On a soggy field in Granada Hills, eight units stand at attention. They are ready to salute the American flag as it rises toward the sky.

The bugler lifts the instrument to his mouth and waits. A short delay gives away the trick before a recording of "Reveille" blasts out from stereo speakers as the flag moves up the pole.

## Marching, Mostly In Step

Each morning, four students stand watch over the front entrance of the school. Each represents one company: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta.

They eye the students. They are searching for mistakes in uniforms. Colored nail polish is prohibited, but makeup is allowed in moderation. Any violation is a demerit. Each demerit lands a student 15 minutes of detention. The school calls that a "reboot."

At Branch Elementary, 60 percent of the students' parents are in the military.

"It's just sad to think that somebody is out there protecting our country," principal Dennison Winchell said. "And at home their kids are going to a school with great teachers, but with awful" buildings.

In Italy, a Marine asked Carter a question. Carter answered that the country's soldiers must come from the entire American population. "Half the American population is female. So I'd be crazy not to" consider women for military jobs, he said.

MILWAUKEE — A team of Wisconsin scientists has stitched together an exciting 360-degree view of the Milky Way. This remarkable new view shows our spiral-shaped galaxy from every direction.

PITTSBURGH, Pa. — On the national day of charity known as Giving Tuesday, about 100 employees of Dick's Sporting Goods came to the Sarah Heinz House in Pittsburgh. They were there to clean, paint and decorate for the holidays.

Millions of people gave money online to charities that day. The group from Dick's worked side by side with middle-school students at the Sarah Heinz House. Those students take part in clubs, lessons and other activities at the building.

The researchers sought out nine nonprofits. These included Rutgers and Otterbein universities, the University of North Carolina and WBEZ public radio in Chicago. They studied the nonprofits' efforts to get attention before Giving Tuesday and how they advertised the day of the event.

Some nonprofits used online-only campaigns limited to emails and social media posts. Millennials did not respond as well to those, Feldmann said. 

Nonprofits that linked Giving Tuesday to something happening got the biggest response from millennials, he said.

The University of North Carolina (UNC) offers one example. There a student-giving council and a young graduate leadership council hosted on-campus Giving Tuesday events.

UNC created its own hashtag, or Twitter label, for the day. It was called "#TarHeelTuesday." It also encouraged students to volunteer with a certain program and to share their photos on Snapchat.

The university raised about $236,000. Its goal was only  $150,000. About $23,000 or nearly 10 percent of the total amount raised came from millennials. Almost three in 10 of the people who gave money were millennials.

A combination of Internet, community and self-organizing plans get a good response, Feldmann said. These let millennials feel like they "own" the day and the experience, he said.

KHOGNOO KHAN, Mongolia — Altai Davaa and her brother, Tsagaana, live a simple life far from the big city. The two sleep in a traditional Mongolian tent known as a yurt and cook over a wood-fire stove. The nearest paved road is about 10 miles away.

When the sun begins to set, they connect with the outside world. Tsagaana plugs in his solar-powered satellite dish and television, and starts flipping through the channels. He gets more than 60 stations, offering everything from "Breaking Bad" to hit Hollywood movies.

Tsagaana certainly has plenty of choices when searching for something to watch. Even though it has a population of just 3 million, Mongolia has 138 homegrown television stations. Most were started in just the last 10 years.

They air everything from wrestling matches to home-shopping programs to talk shows and news. There is the Miss World Mongolia beauty contest and even a Mongolian Academy Awards program.

"It's just crazy," says Mongolian journalist Bayarmagnai Puntsag.

PHILADELPHIA — The University of Pennsylvania is at the cutting edge of a drive to experiment with free online courses that are open to anyone. But its own study found out that, so far, the courses have had mixed results.

The courses are known as MOOCs. That stands for Massive Open Online Courses. They have attracted millions of viewers and have been promoted as a possible way to address skyrocketing education costs. Yet, only 4 out of every 100 students actually complete the courses, according to a new study by the University of Pennsylvania.

Many who sign up drop off after the first week or two, the study found. About half who signed up viewed one lecture or more.

The results come on the heels of another Penn study, released last month. It showed that most students enrolled in MOOCs already had college degrees. People are taking the courses mostly to get ahead in their jobs.

## Learning For Fun

One tribe, the Salinan Indians, says the landmark can only be climbed on special religious days. The other tribe, the Northern Chumash Indians, believes it should never be tread upon. The Chumash think the beauty of Morro Rock should only be looked at from a distance.

This dispute has turned into a legal battle. Last December, the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, a group that represents the tribe, filed a document in court. They argued that the Salinan Tribe should not be allowed to climb the mountain. The Chumash believe the site is sacred and should be off-limits.

## Protecting People From Mosquitoes

MIAMI — The remote-controlled plane known as a drone has been used to fight terrorists and criminals. Now, it is about to take on a new enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.

The new [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) is about half the size of a typical Florida sea hawk. It won't spray or blast bugs. Instead, it will carry a special camera that picks up differences in temperature.

Dengue is on the rise worldwide. The mosquito that carries the dengue virus has spread to 100 countries. There are 2.5 billion people it could reach. Some 50 million to 100 million people come down with dengue each year, health officials say. About 25,000 die.

People with the disease get dehydrated very fast. "In a matter of hours, the cases can grow more complicated," said Dr. Carlos Galvez. He is a health official in Panama.

It's a difficult decision for the 27-year-old, who hails from Texas. Leonard has been accepted into law school at Texas Tech for the fall. But he is also one of 705 people competing to become part of the first human colony on Mars.

## Lots Of People Signed Up

## Maybe It's All Just A Dream

A new report found that about one in three adults ages 18 to 31 live in their parents' homes. This is the highest percentage in at least 40 years. Some people say that this means they're lazy and don't want to find a job.

That idea "doesn't hold up," says Arnett.

What they're not necessarily getting, however, are jobs. The report found that fewer 18- to 31-year-olds had jobs in 2012 compared to 2007.

They are looking for meaning and purpose "and self-growth in their careers," says Varda Konstam. She is a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. Konstam also wrote "Parenting Your Emerging Adult: Launching Kids From 18 to 29."

## Testing Bald's Cure On Mice

CHICAGO — Erin Argyilan is trying to solve the mystery of the holes that appear and vanish in the sands of Mount Baldy in Indiana.

The holes are about a foot in diameter, and they exist for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand.

A blast wiped out everything for miles around. It destroyed 230 square miles of forest. When the dust and ash settled, a horseshoe-shaped shell of a mountain was left.

That shell provided a perfect nest for a baby glacier.

The shell faces north. This helps shield snow from the sun. A thick layer of volcanic rock on the floor blocks the volcanic heat from below. A lava dome formed where snow could pile up.

When Lynne Rodgers Miller saw the news of the mudslide, she knew exactly where the land had given way. Her husband, Daniel Miller, knew, too.

LOS ANGELES — John Muir helped create the national park system. Some people say he's the godfather of environmentalism, the movement to save and protect nature.

Christensen and others see Muir's thoughts as out of date. They say now there are new environmental challenges. Muir could not have imagined population growth, the spread of cities, or climate change.

The argument is over Muir's major idea. He thought of wilderness as something to be left untouched. He wanted people to experience pure nature. That idea helped shape environmentalism for 100 years. It made sure that there would be unspoiled wilderness for new generations.

"He had a huge passion for nature," said Mary Ellen Hannibal, an author and a Muir fan. He believed in "experiencing nature firsthand."

Nature has many forms, they say. Untouched wilderness is only one.

The ancient Egyptians may have figured out how to make a mummy much earlier than believed. Recently, scientists found signs of mummy-making from 4300 B.C.

A 3,000-year-old Egyptian priest named Amen-Nestawy-Nakht was at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. He was there for an X-ray. It was a 3-D X-ray, called a CAT scan. He'd had one many years ago, when technology was not as good as it is today.

The St. Louis Art Museum hired special movers. They moved Amen-Nestawy and two other mummies. The movers loaded them into foam cases and took them to Barnes.

## Scanning The Mummies

By Sunday afternoon, the team had scanned two mummies.

But the mummy fit just fine into the machine. The doctors crowded into the control room and stared at the computer. And then his insides came up on the screen.

As the giant machine scanned the mummy, the computer showed shapes in black-and-white. It picked up a round object in the middle of his chest. Doctors said it looked like an amulet that the robbers didn't get. In ancient Egypt, amulets were pieces of jewelry buried with mummies. They were meant to keep the person safe and healthy in the afterlife.

Koretz represents parts of the Westside and parts of the San Fernando Valley. He said people in those areas have told him they don't support the new rules. They worry about the murals' appearance. And they also worry that murals will attract graffiti and become "God-awful eyesores."

He said there were no mural regulations when he painted the McQueen piece. "We were a free country then."

Murals became very popular in Los Angeles during the 1970s. Artists took to walls to express their thoughts about political and social issues.

It was a culture that just suddenly sprang up, Rojas-Williams said. "And it all happened at the same time without the artists knowing each other."

Milly Wu marched through the J. Paul Getty Museum's galleries. She stopped to take pictures of Monets, Manets and, of course, Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises."

"It's very beautiful," said her dad, Will Wu, who speaks some English. "Mr. Getty had a great eye for this type of item."

## Pay Attention To The Art, Too

Everyone dislikes some kind of music, of course. But are there people out there who just don't get much out of _any_ music? In other words, are there people who simply aren't moved by music that hits others in the heart?

A new study published on Thursday says the answer is yes.

This finding was made by a team of scientists from Spain and Canada. They had been working on measuring how much pleasure people get from listening to music. To their surprise, they found that one out of every 20 people they studied claim to get no pleasure at all from music.

So they followed up by testing 30 more people. Those who said they took the least pleasure in music also showed the least emotion, or feelings, when listening. These people showed little emotion even when listening to pieces they had chosen themselves. Emotion was measured by monitoring changes in heart rate and sweat on subjects' skin.

"I would say it was less typical," Marco said of the mix of tracks the music-lovers brought in.

CHICAGO, Ill. — Sophia Pellar plays the flute in her New Trier High School pep band. The noise from the band used to hurt her ears. The pain ended after an ear doctor gave her some special earplugs.

Sophia, who is 16, said pep band can be "crazy loud." She wears the earplugs then. "But the thought of wearing them every day is a little embarrassing," she said.

## The Music Gets Louder

WASHINGTON — Pianist Jan Lisiecki is about to turn 20. The young star is looking forward to an exciting birthday. He will be flying to Abu Dhabi to play in a concert there for the first time. Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates. It's in the Middle East, and it's hotter than Lisiecki is used to.

"We're going to get some warm weather, which is always nice when you live in Canada," Lisiecki said. He lives in Calgary with his parents. They will be traveling with him to Abu Dhabi.

MINNEAPOLIS — Seven-year-old Tremell Caldwell tapped his feet on the floor. He made funny faces and wiggled the cello between his knees.

"I didn't start playing the trumpet till I was 12," he said. "It gave me a voice at a time when I really needed one and allowed me to feel like I was doing something (important). Music helps you stand out for all the right reasons."

Back in the school music room, Tremell Caldwell stood under a large poster of jazz great John Coltrane. Tremell asked, "Can I go outside now?"

Morgan-Brist said yes. But she first asked him to read aloud from a handwritten note by one of the program's supporters.

He broke into a broad grin, then ran for the door.

Her idea is noble. It would be easier to live by if the Internet had never happened. Still, if the Internet had never happened, Swift wouldn't have 46 million followers.

This summer, Hurley is going to Beirut, Lebanon. He will be going to a kind of summer camp for students who already have some musical training. The students rehearse and put on a concert at the end of the visit.

Every year, the U.S. government helps send musicians, dancers and teachers overseas in hopes that the artists will spread goodwill for America around the world.

The idea to send artists overseas got its start in the 1950s. That's when the United States sent jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong and others abroad to showcase the special American art form.

The programs have since exploded. The latest rage is hip-hop.

![](https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140221_SILVER.jpg)CHICAGO —Silver has long been known for its ability to kill germs that can make people sick. In hospitals, it's used to help burn victims. It can wipe out dangerous "superbugs" that are resistant to regular antibiotics.

Now, companies are trying to make money off of people's fear of germs. They're adding the tiny, strong bits of silver on cutting boards, underwear, and yoga mats. They're even adding the silver to running shirts, socks and an other "antibacterial" goods.

Such products are made possible by new advances in technology that allow manufacturers to make nano-sized silver and put it into different materials. Nanometer-sized silver is smaller than you can imagine. About 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers fit on a single strand of hair.

NAPA, Calif. — City officials in Napa had worried that a serious earthquake could wreck the historic Alexandria Square building.

So they required brick buildings like the Alexandria to be retrofitted. Retrofitting buildings to make them stronger involves bolting brick walls to ceilings and floors.

Long spaceflights will likely put crews at some risk, according to the report. Missions may include long stays on the International Space Station and trips to explore an asteroid, or even Mars. Some of these dangers are known. Other dangers cannot be even be imagined yet.

NASA's newest unmanned explorer rocketed into space late Friday from Virginia. It dazzled sky watchers along the East Coast.

But the LADEE spacecraft quickly had equipment trouble. NASA assured everyone early Saturday that the spacecraft was safe and on a perfect track for the moon. But the problems need to  be fixed in the next two to three weeks, officials said.

LADEE had been spinning too fast when it separated from the rocket that carried it from Earth, Worden said. Special wheels were turned on to fix this. They are called "reaction wheels." But then the computer automatically shut the wheels down. Apparently, there was too much electricity. Worden said the wheels may have been running a little fast.

## The Size Of A Small Car

A light-year is a measure of distance. It is not a measure of time. A light-year is the distance that light travels over one year. One light-year is nearly 6 trillion miles.

It was just a regular Friday morning in Chelyabinsk, Russia. Suddenly, a fireball raced across the sky. Minutes later, there was a huge explosion in the air. The force of the boom smashed windows. It blew the doors off buildings.

The blinding light and loud boom were caused by an asteroid. The rock was 50 feet wide. It entered the Earth's atmosphere at 40,000 miles per hour. It burned up in a flash before exploding 14 miles up in the air. Small parts of the asteroid have been found on the ground all around the region.

About 1,500 people were injured by the explosion. Most of the people were hurt by broken glass. Thousands of buildings were damaged.

## Russia's Surprise Guest

## What To Do About A Huge Space Rock

Last week, politicians and scientists met to talk about dangerous asteroids. But the news from the meeting was not very hopeful.

NASA has found nearly all of the biggest asteroids that are floating in space near Earth. These rocks measure one kilometer or more through the middle. The experts are watching these huge rocks very closely. If one of these massive asteroids hits the planet, it could wipe out nearly every living plant and animal on Earth. This includes humans.

## The End Of The World

Scientist John Holdren said, "An asteroid of that size, or bigger, could end civilization."

WASHINGTON — The International Space Station might just get four more years in orbit.

NASA plans to announce this week that the White House wants to extend the station by four years. That will extend its work to 2024.

NASA considers the station necessary to explore space in the future. But extending it by four years likely would cost NASA about $3 billion a year from 2021 to 2024. That's a big chunk of money. Right now, NASA spends about $17 billion a year.

The government's approval, however, doesn't mean that the station will last past its current end date of 2020. At some point, Congress must decide how much NASA spends. And that could affect whether the station's life gets extended.

WASHINGTON — There is a lot of math and science that is involved in driving a race car.

NASCAR, the racing organization, wants to teach kids the science behind the racing.

The same is true at national parks across the country. All together, the repairs would cost $11.5 billion. Written out, that is $11,500,000,000.

## More Than Just Medical Care

The patch of corn near the driveway is a special white variety handed down by generations of Oneida Indians. The black beans sprouting on nearby vines were grown for centuries by the Hopi. There's squash from the Lakota tribe, corn from the Dakotas.

## "History In Those Plants"

The group had a big task before it. It's well-known that Indians were the first to grow pumpkins, beans, corn and squash. But it's more than that: They actually used about 1,900 types of plants for foods and 2,900 for medicines.

The farm also grows organic vegetables, which its teenage Garden Warriors were harvesting last week.

Something else is growing, too: a new approach to food that is spreading among Native Americans across the nation. The idea is to improve the health of Indians through rediscovering the foods their ancestors ate.

Little Earth is a housing area located in a poor part of Minneapolis. The Indians there live in the big city, far from any large patches of farmland. Yet, they are finding ways to grow traditional Native American crops. Many of those crops existed long before European settlers arrived.

WASHINGTON — Leaders in Washington, D.C., have not paid much attention to the Bureau of Indian Education. It is part of the U.S. government that is responsible for about 200 schools where thousands of Native American children go.

President Barack Obama wants to give more money to the department. The money would help to fix dozens of schools that are falling apart. The president also wants to help young Native Americans have better lives.

## Keeping Promises For Schooling

Many days, she finds black dust coating the inside of her trailer home. Farmers say fruit and vegetables are drying up because of the bad air from the mine and the power plant. Fewer eagles and jack rabbits live here now.

In the last two years, Dixon suspects the air has killed 38 of her 56 sheep, but it's not just her animals who are suffering. Old people often find it hard to breathe, she says.

This year, the government released a report saying improvements were being made at Four Corners. The report estimated that the chance of getting cancer near the plant is one in a million.

FARMINGTON, N.M. — During World War II, Tom Jones Jr. served as one of the legendary Navajo code talkers. These [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) Marines used their own language to send secret messages the enemy was never able to figure out. Years later, the Navajo Nation decided to express its appreciation: It built him a house.

These days that house is in bad shape. The 89-year-old Jones struggles to keep warm during winter. His only heat comes from the ancient wood stove in the living room. What's more, the electricity doesn't work in his bathroom and the floor has worn away. The rough wood shows beneath his feet.

"My desire is a house where I can be able to get around, to have a heating system so I can sleep well and enjoy life," Jones said. He was speaking in the Native language of Dine. It was this language he had used to send messages for the U.S. and its allies during the war.

"There is a huge crisis taking place," said Navajo government spokesman Rick Abasta. "You'll even see some families living in storage sheds."

The tribe began constructing homes for veterans during the 1980s. And in 1998 it launched a new home-building program. This was made possible by a $6-million fund for Navajo veterans created by the tribe.

The aim was to provide free houses to veterans in need or help them pay for home repairs.

There is only so much the tribe can do, Abasta said, because of limited funding. "We meet with congressmen about these issues," he said. "But most often it falls on deaf ears."

"Now you can see how our Navajo code talkers are treated," Arviso said. At Jones' house she has put up a sign out front: "Navajo Code Talker Needs a New Home."

When the military got him to sign up 73 years ago, he was told that he would have whatever he needed after the war, Jones said. He served as a corporal in the 3rd Marine Division from 1943 to 1945. A good part of that time was spent in heavy fighting, including at Iwo Jima.

When he returned home, he said, he was able to provide for himself. At one point he worked in the mines. When he was younger he never asked for handouts, he said proudly.

But when he got ill in 2007, he could no longer provide for himself. Jones is now in very poor health. He has a hard time hearing and can barely talk.

Jones has a grandson who followed him into the Marines. That grandson, Jarvis Jones, 37, said he was disappointed and disgusted with how his grandfather and other code talkers live.

"It's a lot of runaround," the younger Jones said. "The story on the reservation is 'We have no funds.'"
Last week, the tribe's high court said Christopher Deschene could not run for president. His opponents claimed he could not speak Navajo well enough. Under tribal law, the president of the Navajo nation must be able to speak the language.

"Our sacred language defines us as individuals and as a Nation," the court said.

The U.S. Navy made history Wednesday when an experimental airplane landed off the coast of Virginia. It was the first time that a [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), or a plane with no pilot, landed on an aircraft carrier at sea.

The test flight of the drone called X-47B "Salty Dog 502" could dramatically change naval flying.

WASHINGTON — A decade of operations against terrorists has created doubts about whether aircraft carriers are necessary. The number of carriers in the Navy has already been reduced from 11 to 10. And cuts in government spending threaten to shrink the number to as few as eight or nine.

WASHINGTON — A former Navy man launched an attack Monday morning inside a building at the Washington Navy Yard. He shot office workers in the cafeteria and in a hallway of the tightly guarded military property, authorities said. Thirteen people were killed, including the gunman.

Mayor Vincent Gray was asked if it was a terrorist attack. "We don't have any reason to think that at this stage," he said. But he said it had not been ruled out.

## Keeping The Secret

To see the future of the NBA, they can just turn their heads. Whiteboards inside their office are filled with step-by-step instructions to solve different problems. Programmers sit around computers typing in lines of code.

It might not make sense to anyone without a degree in computer science. But these numbers could help NBA teams find the best ways to improve their play. For the first time this season, cameras that track motion will placed in every arena.

It all starts with six tiny cameras placed in each NBA arena. They will record the movement of every player, referee and the ball 25 times a second. The information is electronically sent to a company to be put into categories such as passes, dribbles and shots.

Teams can get information such as the number of passes while games are in progress. More complicated information is available after the game once more numbers are processed.

Several teams have also hired people to make sense of all that information.

But, coaches may only pass on a handful of the information to their players.

Players are conflicted about the value of this info: like, which players shoot after just two dribbles.

Clippers player Chris Paul is one of them. "If I just guard him and after two dribbles I stop, and he takes a third and I say, 'Hey, man, you're only supposed to take two dribbles,' then what?" Paul said.

CHICAGO — On Tuesday, the government opened a closely watched hearing. The subject at hand was a plan for college athletes to form their own powerful group. If the idea is approved, it will be the first of its kind in U.S. history.

Colter said most of the team's 85 scholarship players support forming a union. Still, he has been the only one to step forward publicly. He did so with the support of the United Steelworkers union, the players association and its leader, former UCLA linebacker Ramogi Huma. Huma was also expected to testify, possibly on Wednesday.

Supporters say a union would help athletes get money to support themselves. It could also improve their safety, they say. They note that players are left out of the billions generated through college athletics. Their scholarships sometimes don't even cover livings expenses for a full year, they claim.

A decision by the NLRB could come soon after the hearing ends.

For now, the push is to let athletes form unions is happening at private schools, like Northwestern. State universities follow different rules. 
NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — All North Charleston patrol officers will begin wearing body cameras, the town's mayor announced.

Three years later, in 2005, the Colts started building the Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis. It cost $720 million, but the team paid only $100 million. The city and Indiana paid the other $620 million.

Los Angeles did not get a team then. It still has not. In some ways, the city has been worth more to the NFL without having a team.

BALTIMORE — An angry group of media commentators and our political leaders in Washington, D.C., have taken to attacking the National Football League. Its crime: not properly policing the private lives of two of its most well-known players.

No one is excusing Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson. Their behavior, and that of a handful of other NFL stars, has been outrageous.

Abusing one's wife or child is a serious crime. It goes against our laws and our morals. People guilty of such crimes ought to receive stiff punishment. But this is America. They deserve a fair trial. It's likely they will be found guilty. If they are, they deserve punishments that fit their crimes.

In the meantime, let's get real. The NFL can urge its several thousand players to behave morally. However, it cannot watch them 24 hours a day without seriously violating their rights. It's the same as if we asked companies like NBC News, IBM, General Motors or Exxon Mobil to invade their workers' private lives.

STOCKHOLM — Canadian short story writer Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday.

Munro captured a wide range of lives and personalities without passing judgment on her characters. Her work consists almost entirely of short stories. Most Nobel winners write novels or books. "Lives of Girls and Women" is her only novel. Even that is often described as a collection of linked stories.

"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," the 82-year-old told The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia.

## Beloved And Admired

She received a scholarship to study at the University of Western Ontario, majoring in journalism. Munro was still an undergraduate when she sold a story to CBC radio in Canada. She dropped out of college to marry a fellow student, James Munro. They had three children and she became a full-time housewife. By her early 30s, she had become depressed and said she could barely write a full sentence.

Then you might begin to understand how people in Norway feel. Their country did very badly in last weekend's cross-country skiing results at the Olympics.

In both the men's and women's relay events, Norway didn't win a single medal. This is like a national sports disaster. In Norway, people are said to be born with skis on their feet. It was only the second time the Norwegians haven't won a single medal in the relay races since 1964.

What's worse, their biggest rival Sweden won both races. The Swedes had such a big lead in Sunday's men's race that Marcus Hellner, the Swedish anchor, had time to relax and carry his country's blue and yellow flag down the last part of the race.

The relay races are a source of deep national pride.

WICOMICO RIVER, Md. — In the office of the team that is trying to get rid of Maryland's beaver-like nutria, there is a large whiteboard. The board has names and numbers on it. They're bets about how many nutria the team will find in the marshes of the Wicomico River.

It was a gray April afternoon, and the nutria project leader was coming back from a site in Quantico, Md. There, four of his trappers were roaming the Wicomico River in boats. They had killed about 120 nutria there so far.

The river is the site of the final battle in their effort to get rid of the animals. Nutria means otter in Spanish. Kendrot describes them as "a 20-pound rat with a scaly tail and buck teeth."

The wetlands in the Chesapeake region have lost more marsh than most other wetlands around the world, Kendrot said. A study in the 1990s proved that the nutria were largely responsible.

The oarfish remain mostly mysterious to researchers. They live deep down in the sea and have been seen underwater only a few times. What little scientists do know has come from the few dead ones that have washed ashore.

"If all you knew about deer was roadkill ... how much would you actually know about deer?" said Milton Love, a marine biologist. "That's kind of where we are with oarfish."

The 18-foot giant found on Oct. 13 was among the largest oarfish reported in nearly 20 years. A 14-foot fish beached on Friday. That one was cut open and examined by scientists on Monday.

But, results from the research could take years to complete, scientists said.

## Young Victims Remembered

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama used executive actions on immigration Thursday night to stop deportations. Nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally will now be able to stay in the U.S. He also directed enforcement efforts against illegal immigrants to track down just "felons, not families."

The moves are the largest changes to U.S. immigration laws in nearly 30 years.

One group will benefit most: Immigrants who have been in the U.S. illegally for more than five years but whose children are citizens or permanent residents. Those individuals will be able to apply to not be deported. They'll also be able to get work permits. Before doing so, they'll have to pass background checks and pay fees. The administration expects about 4.1 million people to qualify.

Obama is also broadening his 2012 directive. It delayed deportation for some young immigrants who entered the country illegally. The current cutoff was for people who arrived in the U.S. as minors before 2007. Obama will expand so that some young people arriving before 2010 can avoid deportation. In all, those changes are expected to affect about 300,000 people.

Those who qualify would receive delays for three years at a time.

What do the minimum wage, preschool and gun laws have in common?

They are all things President Barack Obama wants to expand.

The president talked about these goals in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday. He then spent the rest of the week on the road and in cyberspace. The president is trying to spread the word about his ideas from the speech.

Jobs were a top item in the president's speech. Currently, employers must pay workers at least $7.25 an hour. That's the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage). Obama wants to raise the minimum wage to $9. He also wants to spend more on job training and high-tech factory hubs.

The next day he flew to North Carolina to visit an auto parts factory. American factories have been closing in recent years. Companies can save money by making their products overseas.

The president said the U.S. should focus on high-tech factories. That's how the U.S. can win back jobs that pay a good, living wage.

On Wednesday, Obama flew to Georgia. He visited a preschool class. He gave high-fives and fist bumps to the class of 4-year-olds. The president said in his State of the Union speech that preschool should be available to all children.

## Obama Lets It All Hang Out

Obama said the fair is one of the most fun events held each year at the White House. "Every year I walk out smarter than when I walked in," Obama said.

A scientist who works for Obama named John Holdren joined the president at the fair. "Amazing," he said, as he examined the students' work. "These kids are so much more advanced than when I was in school."

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama said Tuesday night that efforts to remove poison gas weapons from Syria peacefully may work. But the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad "and be ready to respond" if other measures fail, he said.

Obama said the country was tired after 10 years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan. "America is not the world's policeman," he said.

But if, with a little bit of effort and risk, "we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional."

A lot has been happening around Syria over the past 10 days. First Obama unexpectedly stepped back from a threatened military strike. He said he would first ask Congress to pass a law authorizing the use of force against Assad.

Most people do not want the American military to get involved in Syria. Polls keep showing this.

If peaceful negotiations fail and the United States does not act, Assad could keep using poison gas. So could other tyrants. U.S. troops could be gassed, he said.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama's popularity has slipped in surveys of Americans. But he is still popular with one group: the leaders of the 566 big Indian tribes.

Brian Cladoosby has headed up Washington state's Swinomish Indian Tribal Community for the past 17 years. He said Obama was "second to none" when compared with other U.S. presidents.

Tribal leaders consider the president one of their own. To them, he's Barack Black Eagle Obama. A couple on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana gave him his Indian name in 2008 when they adopted him. They got a chance to meet with him again on Wednesday. The president hosted his fifth White House Tribal Nations Conference.

But some tribal leaders said the president and his team had promised a lot, and that they had been slow to deliver.

Obama and his team said they've done a lot to help. They've supported a law that makes it easier for tribes to charge non-Indian people for attacks against women. They've arranged for 230,000 acres of land to be given to the tribes. They're spending more on police, schools and emergency relief.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama called Wednesday for the U.S. to depend less on military force as it deals with other countries. Obama instead promoted diplomacy and international partnerships. He sees working with other countries as a better approach to tackling global terrorism.

"This is American leadership. This is American strength," he said. Obama spoke about efforts to work with Europe to isolate Russia for its intervention in Ukraine and to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear pursuit. He acknowledged that neither crisis has yet been fixed. Obama argued, however, that there's an opportunity to resolve them peacefully.

Obama's comments came in a speech to graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. The president used the speech to take on critics. Some have accused him of a foreign policy that has scaled back U.S. power. Obama declared that the U.S. remains necessary. And if its interests are threatened, it will strike.

Since World War II, he said, "some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures." In those mistakes, the U.S. acted "without thinking."

The speech came a day after Obama announced that combat operations in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) would end before 2015. The president said the cadets would be the first graduating class since Sept. 11, 2001, not to be sent into combat in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq) or Afghanistan. Cadets cheered the news.

## A Course Of Action

WASHINGTON – President Barack Obama says he wants to move quickly to bring fast Internet to American public schools. On Tuesday, he made a promise. He said he wants to make sure students in the United States have the same advantages that students in other countries have.

In a video released Tuesday, the president and his wife said the library will be on the city's South Side. It will be built in a park. No decision has been made, though,  whether it will be built in Jackson Park or Washington Park.

The University of Chicago had long been considered the favorite candidate.

WASHINGTON —The United States has a weight problem. Over one-third of adults are more than just overweight, they are obese. So are one-tenth of children. On Tuesday, the top U.S. medical organization voted to label obesity as a disease.

## Lack Of Exercise

The flawed gene doesn't explain weight gain in everyone, either. The gene was found in nearly half of all Europeans tested. However, it was found in only a very small number of black people. That means other genes are clearly at work, too.

Having the flawed gene doesn't mean a person will definitely become obese, but may make it more likely. Genes come in pairs. Some people in the study had two copies of the gene. One copy came from their mom. The other came from their dad. They weighed an average of 7 pounds more than people without two copies. Yet some people weighed much more than that.

The study was done on people in Sweden, Norway and other parts of Europe.

The new study compared obese and non-obese students in Sweden. It found that obese teens are much less likely to graduate from high school. The difference is startling. Only 56 percent of the obese students finished all 12 years of schooling. To compare, 76 percent of their slimmer classmates did.

"The differences are much larger than we predicted," the authors of the study said.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — Scientist Gretchen Hofmann has a tank full of wriggly sea urchins. These purple, prickly animals live underwater and are not known for their speed.

<img class="pull-right" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/newsela-test-files-f331e/uploads/20130913_Coast_OCEANHEALTH.jpg" alt="Ocean Acidification Chart" /> HILO, Hawaii — The newest addition to Washington's oyster industry is at the end of a palm tree-lined drive in Hawaii. Nearby are piles of hard black lava.

CASPER, Wyo. — These are boom times in the Cowboy State, thanks to an oil explosion.

But some people worry that Wyoming is relying heavily on just oil.

Wyoming's oil business failed in the mid-1980s. If that happens again, it could expose a problem for the state: The easy oil money has prompted teenagers to skip college, or abandon high school, for the oil fields. And many don't have a backup plan if things go bad.

NAGS HEAD, N.C. — The boom of seismic cannons will soon sound under the Atlantic Ocean as companies look for oil and gas. It will be the first time oil and gas exploration has been allowed off the East Coast in 30 years. It will start as early as next spring.

Government officials and the oil and gas industry say the exploration is harmless. Bob Edwards disagrees. He is the mayor of Nags Head, a coastal town on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Edwards is worried about what the intense sound waves can do to dolphins and endangered North Atlantic right whales. There are only about 500 right whales left.

"I just can't understand how anybody would propose something that's going to be ... endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," he said.

Government officials say they will put limits on when the seismic cannons are fired during whale migration. They will also require sound tests to search for marine animals. People on board will keep watch as well. If whales or other animals get too close, the cannons will be stopped.

It is different in the Atlantic, he said. Species of large Atlantic whales operate at low frequencies and will hear the booms. Companies must take a huge amount of care near spawning or feeding grounds of such whales, Ioup said.

In addition, blasts can be heard for more than 2,000 miles underwater, said Doug Nowacek, who is a professor.

"If there's a survey in Virginia you're going to hear it in southern North Carolina, easily," Nowacek said.

Since 2008, oil companies in the United States, for example, have increased production 70 percent. They are now pumping 3.5 million more barrels of oil each day. To put it another way, that increase alone is more than most countries pump in a day.

## Some Countries Buying Less Oil

Car and truck drivers have plenty to like about the drop in oil prices.

For oil companies, oil-producing states, and oil-exporting countries, the oil price drop is painful.

Oil companies pump oil from wells they drill. Yet, lower prices could cause them to spend less exploring for oil. Experts say thousands of people could be fired at oil companies.

A huge tornado whipped through Oklahoma Monday. The 200-mile-per hour winds sucked up whole neighborhoods. Frantic residents searched in the rubble for missing loved ones. At least 24 people were killed. Many of the victims were children.

"It was just like the movie 'Twister'," said Lando Hite. "There were horses and stuff flying around everywhere," he told a reporter from television station KFOR. He had no shirt and his body was covered in mud.

The tornado began at 3 p.m. and lasted for 40 minutes. The timing was very bad. Family members were separated between home, school and work. Roads got jammed with people rushing to find their loved ones.

The National Weather Service put out a tornado warning 16 minutes before the twister touched down. Roads were packed as motorists tried to flee.

At 3:01 p.m. the National Weather Service posted on Facebook:  "TORNADO EMERGENCY FOR THE (Oklahoma City) METRO AREA. Large violent deadly tornado moving toward Moore! Take cover RIGHT NOW DO NOT WAIT!!" At 3:03 it wrote on Twitter: "This is as serious as it gets for (Southwest Oklahoma City) and Moore. Please seek shelter now!"

WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said something that upset both athletes and Olympic officials: He suggested that the United States should perhaps not go to the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.

SOCHI, Russia—The dogs are having their day in Sochi.

Packs of mutts roam the downtown streets. Dozens of them have shown up in the new mountain villages the Russian government has built for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

The most surprising story here this month is the pooch problem.

Free-roaming dogs are a global issue. But it has been spotlighted in Sochi because of reports that Olympic organizers hired contractors to kill at least 2,000 animals. That grim news helped fuel interest in protecting the animals, who hang around populated areas begging for food. Most of the dogs are friendly — which explains why a number of visiting athletes are trying to help.

"It makes me sad seeing dogs on the streets," said Brita Sigourney, a California athlete. She competes in ski halfpipe.

GENEVA, Switzerland — Just over 1 million people came to Europe this year, migration experts said Tuesday. The number of migrants set a record. They fled their home countries because of war, poverty and unfair treatment.

As of Monday, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said 1,005,504 people had entered Europe. The number was more than four times as many as last year. Almost all of them came by sea. More than 3,500 people drowned trying to come. European officials have promised to make the migration routes safer.

William Lacy Swing is the head of the IOM. He urged European governments to make migration safer.

Bullying has always been a problem, of course. But it's even more of a problem today now that people spend so much time online.

A court in Argentina has decided that an ape has the same rights as a human. It is the first time a court has ruled that.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Killer whales, or orcas, can live as long as humans when left in the ocean. But killer whales in SeaWorld parks die early. At least, this is what an activist claims in the movie "Blackfish." The movie takes a harsh look at SeaWorld's killer whale program.

But SeaWorld says its killer whales live as long as wild ones. The company says it provides a healthy and interesting home for the 29 orcas it owns. Its captive collection is the largest in the world.

On Wednesday, the government declared that Lolita is still a Puget Sound orca. The department of the government that made the announcement is called the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

## Keiko's Struggles

There are three main reasons behind the decreasing numbers. The whales don't have enough food. Chemicals from pollution are building up in their bodies. And they are disturbed by noise from boats.

Meanwhile, chemicals from pollution build up in their fat. This may affect their health. It also may limit the number of offspring.

## Other Standoffs Have Led To Deaths 

An Oregon teenager has caught the bubonic plague.

According to a new study, Oreos may be as addictive as cocaine — for rats, anyway.

The study shows that the brain reacts to high-fat, high-sugar foods in the same way it reacts to drugs, Schroeder said. "It may explain why some people can't resist these foods" even though "they know they are bad for them."

The original idea for the study came from college student Jamie Honohan.

Honohan wondered why so many people in poor communities are [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — that is, very overweight. She wanted to test the idea that foods with lots of fat and sugar are as addictive as drugs.

There was a reason Oreos were chosen rather than a high-fat, high-sugar rat chow, Schroeder said. The researchers wanted something that was tasty for humans as well as rats. That way the study would say something about "a problem facing humans."

Honohan said she also wanted to use something common in grocery stores. Plus, she noted, rats like Oreos.

This supports the idea that "high-fat, high-sugar foods are addictive," Schroeder said.

Oreo is the best-selling cookie in the world. Mondelez International company just came out with a new kind, called Oreo Thins. They are only about half as thick as regular Oreos and just a little wider.

LOS ANGELES — At a small park in Santa Monica, a group of Los Angeles musicians gathered. All wore dark blue and orange T-shirts printed with the words "Listen Up!"

## The Local Industry Is Nervous

"Every orchestra in the world would love to be doing Hollywood movies," said union official John Acosta. They've been trying very hard "to market themselves" to Hollywood, he added.

There's also growing pressure from studios to save money by hiring lower-cost musicians in Europe. Hourly rates there are a fraction of what they are locally.

For example, musicians in Macedonia might get paid only $10 to $15 an hour. By comparison, musicians in LA receive $75 an hour.

"Everyone is looking to save money," Acosta acknowledged. "Composers want to save as much money as they can upfront."
ISLAMABAD — A large earthquake hit southwestern Pakistan on Tuesday. By Wednesday, authorities said nearly 300 people were dead.

Disaster teams prepared for more deaths. Rescue workers raced to reach isolated mountain villages.

Local television images from Baluchistan showed the extent of the disaster. The earthquake left vast fields of mud, bricks, broken furniture, battered household items and traditional string beds. Most houses in the region are poorly constructed of simple materials.

In one video, a dazed man pawed through the rubble. He tried to collect a few modest possessions from his destroyed home.

The area around Awaran has significant seismic activity. Three plates of the earth's crust meet there: the Eurasia, Arabia and India plates. The India plate moves north into the Eurasia plate by about 1.5 inches a year. It has created the world's tallest mountains — the Himalayan, Karakoram, Pamir and Hindu Kush ranges, capped by Mt. Everest.

Pakistan suffered the worst earthquake in its history in 2005. It killed more than 74,000 people.

WASHINGTON — National and state parks will be open for business this summer, but it won't be business as usual. Washington is sending less money to parks. States will be contributing fewer dollars as well. The result won't be pretty. Trash cans may overflow. Lines will be long at park entrances. Children will miss out on campfire talks.

## Some Sites To Be Shut

At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, a $1.2 million cut means that six buildings will be closed. Visitors will not be able to see where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence. The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall are canceling evening visitor hours.

The Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi must deal with a $359,000 cut. It plans to shut three visitor centers a few days each week.  Even some restrooms must close. Most trash cans are history. Visitors will be told to pack and take out their own garbage.

## A Workout In The Park

ORLANDO, Fla. — Walt Disney World visitors wait in long lines. At the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride they once had to stand in the sun.

Now, the riders are ushered into an air-conditioned tent. Kids can play on slides, a climbing tower, and a toy fire engine. Parents wait for the buzz of a pager telling them it's time to board the ride.

"It's so much better this way," Russ Spence of Richmond, Va., said as he relaxed in the tent. He was waiting to take his 3-year-old grandson on the ride.

Theme park lines keep getting longer. That's why parks like Disney World in Florida are investing a lot of money to make waiting times fly by. It makes good business sense. Long lines are one of the biggest gripes of theme park goers.



















There were once more than 3 billion passenger pigeons in the world, but in 1914, there was just one. Her name was Martha, and she lived alone in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo.

Other cities are trying to install public Wi-Fi after older attempts did not work. New York officials say their project is making the Internet available to everybody. They say the plan will also make old street phones modern.

Payphones might seem old fashioned. After all, more than two-thirds of Americans own smartphones, the Pew Research Center on Internet, Science & Technology says. There are still about 8,200 payphones on New York streets.

Some were used when other phones did not work after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Still, there are fewer of them. They are not being used as much. More than one-third of those inspected last year did not even work.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — A group trying to rid the world of chemical weapons won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. It was given the award for its efforts to destroy Syria's supply of poison gas and other chemical weapons.

The prize was awarded to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). The Nobel Committee wanted to use the prize to achieve two goals at once: The first was to make people aware of Syria's bloody civil war. The second was to raise awareness about the long, deadly history of chemical weapons.

Opinions about the prize were divided in Syria. A Syrian rebel, who is against the government, was not pleased. He said the award will move the world's attention away from "the real cause of the war." On the other side, a lawmaker from Syria's government said the Nobel prize helps President Bashar Assad.

The OPCW was formed in 1997 to carry out the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Chemical Weapons Converntion was an agreement made by countries around the world. It was the first time an entire kind of weapon was outlawed. The OPCW wasn't well known until this year. It stepped into the spotlight after  the U.N. asked the group to go to Syria. It wanted the OPCW to investigate claims of a poison gas attack.

Friday's award came just before Syria joins the OPCW on Monday. It will be the 190th country to become a member. OPCW inspectors are already on a disarmament mission in Syria, supported by the U.N. They're seeking to destroy the government's poison gas and nerve agents.

"Events in Syria have been a tragic reminder that there remains much work still to be done," Ahmet Uzumcu said. He heads the OPCW.

"They immediately waddled towards one another," Branch said. She thinks each one felt comforted by seeing another of its own kind.

LOS ANGELES — If you're in stop-and-go traffic, you're probably frustrated. But not if you're a male penguin balancing an egg on your feet in Antarctica. The traffic jam is probably keeping you alive in the bitter cold.

Emperor penguins are the only large animal species that breeds during the Antarctic winter. The continent can be as cold as 58 degrees below zero. The penguins face freezing winds that blow as fast as 124 miles per hour. So they huddle together against the harsh elements. In a huddle, their bodies can raise the temperature within two hours to as high as 98.6 degrees.

## Eggs On Their Feet

Humans usually turn to robots when they need help getting to places that are hard to reach, like the moon or Mars. Now, scientists have built a robot to explore a new territory: colonies of adorable penguins.

A team of scientists has designed a robot, or rover, that looks like a fluffy baby penguin. Because it is disguised, the machine can get up close to real birds without disturbing them.

## Scientist Of The Year

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Art_Picasso_Hidden_Pa_Edit_1.jpg" />WASHINGTON — The year 1901 was an important one for Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso). The painter was just 19 years old and living in Paris. He was in the middle of changing his style of painting. He painted furiously and was very poor. It wasn't strange for him to take one painting and reuse it to paint a fresh idea.

Now scientists and art experts say they've found a hidden painting from that time period. They used infrared technology on "The Blue Room," one of Picasso's earliest important paintings. Underneath it they discovered a painting of a bow-tied man with his face resting on his hand. His image was lying beneath the surface of the other painting.

<img class="pull-left" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Art_Picasso_Hidden_Pa_Edit_2.jpg" />"When he had an idea, you know, he just had to get it down and realize it," curator Susan Behrends Frank said. She described how Picasso had quickly painted "The Blue Room" over another whole picture. "He could not afford to acquire new canvases every time he had an idea. He worked sometimes on cardboard because canvas was so much more expensive."

Experts had suspected there might be something under the surface of "The Blue Room." Some brushstrokes on the piece clearly don't match the painting of a woman bathing in Picasso's studio.

In 2008, better technology was able to show details for the first time. A man's bearded face appeared, resting on his hand with three rings on his fingers. He's dressed in a jacket and bow tie, painted in a vertical composition.

"It's really one of those moments that really makes what you do special," said Patricia Favero. Favero is the conservator at The Phillips Collection. She helped piece together the best image yet of the man's face.

DONGHUI VILLAGE, China — The pig farmer was not in a good mood. The man stood in front of barns that hold more than 500 pigs. He said he has been losing money. The price of pork keeps falling. But the costs of feed and other supplies are going up.

Some of his pigs started dying early this year. There was a series of temperature swings and rains. He had little choice but to throw them out. Before, farmers in the area would have sold them to dealers. The dealers bought dead pigs, even ones with diseases. The dealers illegally sold them again for people to eat. But late last year, the government began cracking down.

"We had no place to put them. We can't sell them anymore. If we do we will be punished," said Wang, 43. "So there's nothing we could do but dump them secretly."

About 1,500 years ago, a disease called the Justinian Plague killed up to 50 million people from Asia to Africa to Europe. Experts say the type, or strain, of bacteria that caused the disease can no longer be found. It may be gone forever.

We will likely never see it again, say the authors of a new study on the missing strain. The study was published in a medical journal. Its authors say the missing strain teaches us a lesson. A strain of plague could jump from rodents to humans. That strain can kill millions of people, and then mysteriously disappear. New and equally deadly strains could appear just as mysteriously, they wrote.

The effects victims experienced from the Justinian Plague were similar to those of victims of the Black Plague. Also called the Black Death, the Black Plague occurred 800 years after the Justinian Plague and killed up to 200 million people.

It is a mystery why the Airbus A320 crashed in the middle of the flight. The pilots did not send out a distress call and had lost radio contact with air traffic controllers, France's aviation authority said. The plane crashed while flying from Barcelona, Spain, to Duesseldorf in Germany.

Germanwings is the airline company that operated the flight. It said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers and six crew members. Officials believe 67 German residents were on board, including a group of high school students. Dutch officials said one Dutch citizen was killed.

The plane crashed in the French Alps at an altitude of 6,550 feet at Meolans-Revels, near a popular ski resort. The area is 430 miles southeast of Paris.

Airbus delivered the plane in 1991 and it had been flown 58,300 hours over about 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane was last checked on Monday. Its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.

Schuyler says we need to protect these creatures from more than just hunters. We need to protect them from our garbage.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Being a catcher in Major League Baseball may get safer. The league plans to make a new rule against runners crashing into catchers as soon as next season but no later than 2015.

New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson made the announcement Wednesday. Alderson is in charge of the league's rules committee. The major reasons behind the decision were player safety and concern over injuries to the brain called concussions. Doctors have learned that concussions can do more damage to the brain than people had thought before.

Baseball is built upon its traditions. A ban will be a major step.

## "What's The Game Coming To?"

"This is, I think, in response to a few issues that have arisen," Alderson said. "One is just the general occurrence of injuries from these incidents at home plate that affect players, both runners and catchers." Alderson added that there are worries about concussions – and not just in baseball. "It's an emerging issue, and one that we in baseball have to address, as well as other sports."

## Mysterious Pluto

PITTSBURGH, Pa. — Koda, a 10-year-old male polar bear, shares an exhibit with 14-year-old Kobe at the Pittsburgh Zoo. He comes out of a cubbyhole and steps out to a nearby ledge, swinging his head from side to side. Then he backs into the cubbyhole, still weaving his head. A moment later, he returns. He keeps doing the same thing, over and over.

Koda isn't alone. Most polar bears in North American zoos do repetitive things. Experts call them "stereotypic behaviors" and say they don't seem to have any purpose.

But even in nature, it's getting hard for the bears to act naturally. In the Arctic, polar bears typically roam hundreds or even thousands of miles. But their home is starting to melt away as the Earth warms up. Climate change is leaving the bears with less room to wander.

At the time, Pittsburgh's zoo didn't have polar bears. Zoo officials said the zoo wouldn't add polar bears unless they had an exhibit that met their needs.

Pittsburgh's polar bears are also given special challenges. Sometimes they crush plastic barrels. Sometimes they have to find ways to get icy fish out of other containers.

Witnesses said the man was unarmed. Anger grew after cellphone video taken from a nearby balcony suggested that police had overreacted.

After the Ferguson teen's death, towns and cities across America took a close look at how police treat black people. People have been asking: What happens when a young black man is stopped by the police? How did it end in death in Ferguson?

The officers answered carefully. Yes, you can videotape the police, they said. No, police are not allowed to profile citizens. A "threatening motion" is any sudden move, especially in the dark. Yes, you should tell police you have a weapon.

When comparing the appearance of United States presidents with the runners-up who did not win the election, the difference is clear. If you look at people who ran for president and lost, many seem to be healthy and lively. President Barack Obama, on the other hand, like many before him, looks tired after some years in the White House. His hair has gone gray.

WASHINGTON — The Whigs were a 19th century political party that broke up before the Civil War over the question of slavery. Now the party is trying to make a comeback. Its supporters see it as the political center between bitter modern day Republicans and Democrats.

"Mural" was something entirely new for American art. Nearly 8 feet high and 20 feet wide, it was covered edge-to-edge with rhythmic lines and bold shapes. These lines and shapes didn't represent anything in particular: That is, they were abstract. They were more about feelings and ideas than physical things. Still, the artist compared them to a stampede of mustang horses. The great painting did much to kick off the art movement called Abstract Expressionism, which emerged in New York following World War II.

He installed a nearly $1 million renewable energy system in 1985.  That system used the methane from manure to create electricity for his farm. In 2002, he replaced that system with newer technology. But he hit a snag. New air-quality rules called for expensive fixes to reduce air pollution. He eventually shut down the system, in 2009.

But in a few weeks, Koetsier's efforts will start again.  A new company will replace his current system. His new system should meet strict clean air rules in the highly polluted San Joaquin Valley.

A decade or so ago, dozens of California dairy farmers built million-dollar systems called methane digesters. Those digesters turn manure into power. But there was unexpected pollution and legal problems. Plus, farmers were hardly making any money from the systems. Most of them gave up. Only a handful are still in use.

PHILADELPHIA — Many people smoke after they've eaten. Lindell Harvey smokes because he hasn't eaten.

The poor are more likely to smoke than those who have enough to support themselves.

In Philadelphia, there is more smoking among the poor than among people who aren't poor, according to Giridhar Mallya. He works for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

Philadelphia is the poorest of the 10 largest U.S. cities. A health department report shows Philadelphia also has one of the highest rates of smoking of any big city.

## Anger Against Christian Clergy

Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world on Monday when he said he is quitting. The [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope), who is the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, said he is too frail for the role. It is the first time a pope has quit in 600 years.

Benedict will turn 86 years old this spring. He gave the news to some high-ranking priests called cardinals. Now, all eyes will be watching the church headquarters in Rome, Italy. That's where the cardinals will meet to choose a new pope.

Popes are expected to serve until their dying breath. That is why it was so shocking when Benedict said he was quitting. The last pope to resign was Gregory XII in 1415. He quit to help end a power struggle within the church.

Benedict and the Catholic Church have faced many tough issues recently. The worst was a worldwide child-abuse scandal involving priests. Benedict apologized to the victims. He worked on preventing future abuse. But some critics said his changes did not go far enough.

Benedict said his mind and body were too weak to lead the church in "today's world." Benedict has complained about many changes in modern life. For example, he is against gay marriage and doesn't approve of rock music.

Benedict was born with the name Joseph Ratzinger in Germany in 1927. His father was a police officer and his mother was a cook. At age 12, he entered a training school for priests. But World War II interrupted his studies. Like all teenage males, he was required to join the German army. For a short time he was a prisoner of war. When the war ended, he resumed his religious training. In 1951 he became a priest. Benedict was the name he chose when he was elected pope.

Some called Benedict "God's Rottweiler." A Rottweiler is a German guard dog known for its fearsome determination. Benedict earned this nickname for his tough-minded, traditional views. For example, he doesn't believe priests should marry. Nor does he think women should be priests.

YUBA CITY, Calif. — Here in California's Central Valley, birds flying high in the sky have spotted water. A flock of migrating birds is swooping down for a landing.

PHILADELPHIA — The humble white potato has lately been at the center of a fierce fight.

The government is pushing hard to get the potato included in the WIC program. WIC provides food to poor mothers and their young children.

The National Potato Council objects to this reasoning. It claims that leaving potatoes out makes them look unhealthy.

WIC officials, meanwhile, are furious.

Campaigners for the poor say Congress is going too far.

Zaebst said she worries that Congress is setting a dangerous example. She fears that other businesses may soon start to push for "foods that wouldn't help families."

Communism is a type of government. In the 1950s, the American government was worried communism was going to take over the world. To prevent Cuba from spreading communism, the U.S. made new rules. People from the United States could not visit Cuba. Americans could not buy anything made in Cuba.

## Studying Brain Growth

Cierra Schell was limping down the Appalachian Trail after nine days of backpacking.

"This is ridiculous," she said. "I feel dirty. My feet got blisters all over. But it was worth it. I reached my breaking point yesterday. I fell. I didn't want to get up, but I did it for my team. So we could reach camp and get some sleep. I felt I couldn't go on, but I pushed myself past that, and I made it."

She had never seen a mountain, much less climbed one. She had gone nine days without a shower. "I don't even smell myself anymore," she said.

Mickai Mercer, 15, melted down. "Sleeping under a tarp with four people I don't even know, it was hard for me," he said. "I cried. I lashed out. I screamed at everyone. People would pick on me and make it worse."

He continued, "After a while, we just all started to get along."

## A Helping Hand

Amanda Jefferson works at Summer Search in Philadelphia. She says that the program can't undo 10 years of bad education. But the program can teach kids how to push through life with a good attitude.

"One in seven of our kids have a family member in jail," she said. "I could count on one hand the number of black boys in our program who have a dad at home."

The second summer they go on more challenging trips, often overseas. They have weekly conversations with adults who help them. They receive support until they are done with college.

Stateline.org news organization said it discovered this after studying a poverty report released by the U.S. government last week. It found that some states with the least amount of poverty in 2013 had some of the highest percentages of people living in deep poverty. The poverty line in 2013 was $23,550 for a family of four. Deep poverty is defined as a family of four living on only $12,000.

Take Maryland. In 2013, about 20 percent of Americans were living close to the federal poverty line, living on about $23,000 to $30,000 per family a year. Maryland was the state with the third-lowest poverty rate in the country. Just 13.3 percent of people in the state were considered poor.

However, nearly 38 percent of Maryland's poor were living in deep poverty. Neighboring Washington, D.C., was the only place with a higher rate of deep poverty.

Experts have several possible explanations for this. Some say that people in parts of rural Maryland are too far from jobs and anti-poverty programs. Others say that many extremely poor people live in certain neighborhoods of Baltimore. A recent study found that about 1 in 10 poor people in Maryland live in neighborhoods where the poverty rate tops 40 percent.

The situation is familiar to Bill McCarthy, the head of Catholic Charities of Baltimore. McCarthy described neighborhoods of Baltimore where more than 90 percent of the people live in poverty and many of them are homeless. Also, more than 70 percent of the people there are not working. Many of them have a police record, which makes it harder for them to find a job. He said most programs for getting people out of poverty don't really work well for them.

Reaching adults in deep poverty can be more difficult. Many programs are limited to parents, or are connected to work.

"Most people in poverty are working," said Elizabeth Lower-Basch. She is with the Center for Law and Social Policy, which is trying to fight poverty. People in deep poverty tend to be out of work or don't have a steady job, she said.

## Supplemental Poverty Measure

## Income Tax Credits

In January 1964, President Lyndon Johnson called for a War on Poverty in the United States. Millions of Americans have been helped since. But many of the states that were among the poorest all those years ago are still poor today.

Almost a quarter of the families in the average state were considered poor in 1959, but some states were in much worse shape than others. More than half of the families in Mississippi were below the poverty line. The poverty line is the least amount of money that people need to live on. The official line was an yearly income of $2,973 for a family of four in 1959, which is like making $23,800 a year today.

## Another Way To Measure Poverty

One study shows that the South is still home to the largest share of poor Americans.

In 1959, nearly four out of 10 families living in Louisiana and Georgia were poor. Those states continue to have high levels today.

A few things could explain why: Both states are among those with the fewest people under 65 that have health care. Both states also have slightly lower education levels than the national average, says the government.

On the other hand, some of the states that were poorest in 1959 appear much better under the newer measure. This shows how government programs can keep families above the poverty line.

Poverty experts and supporters of the government safety net give credit to programs that help family incomes. The government, for example, has said 5 million more Americans would have been considered poor in 2012 without food stamps. Food stamps were part of the War on Poverty.

"We're doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we're doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding of the University of Wisconsin. He says that discussions about the War on Poverty should concentrate on the broader measure and benefits of the safety net.
Top predators are large animals, like lions or great white sharks, that hunt smaller animals, but have no natural enemies. Humans are their only real predator.

## Big Predatory Fish In Trouble

MIAMI — Archaeologists have spent months uncovering evidence of an ancient [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) village. They've concluded it's probably one of the most significant early sites in the United States. And it's right in the middle of downtown Miami.

They have also discovered rows of hundreds of such postholes stretching across the site. Carr believes that these mark the foundations for other structures. It's possible that the Tequesta built boardwalks connecting their homes. The village site once sat along the water. It borders what his team has concluded was the original natural shoreline where Biscayne Bay and the Miami River meet. That spot was filled in by soil long ago.

"What's unusual and unique about the site is that it's this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved,'' Carr said. "It's one of the earliest urban plans in eastern North America."

Carr is being paid by MDM. The company is required by law to pay for the archaeological survey. Carr has recommended to MDM that as much as possible of the site be preserved in place.

Preservationists say MDM took a chance when it purchased the property 10 years ago. It knew the site was inside an archaeological zone. The site was covered by a parking lot for 70 years. Yet, Carr and other archaeologists long suspected it was once part of a Tequesta village. Burial grounds previously found in the immediate area made it likely there would be something more.

SEATTLE, Wash. — The little boy in a bright-green shirt tightly holds onto a sandwich bag and asks, "Can you open this for me?" He hands the bag to the elderly man seated to his right.

"Sure I can, buddy," says 92-year-old David Carriere. The man's wrinkled hands reach for the bag and slowly tear at the opening.

She says interacting with children cheers up the older people. It also helps young children learn about the good and bad parts of aging.

"It's normal for someone to use a wheelchair or a walker, and that's just part of life," Boyd said. "These kids see that every day, and they're not afraid."

SAN QUENTIN, Calif. — It looked a lot like any other newsroom. Editors chatted about the next issue and tinkered with stories, and front pages were tacked up on the walls.

A regular column highlights an OG's opinion — OG for "old guard," rather than the more common "original gangster." There are Sudoku puzzles, book reviews and recaps of prison-yard sports.

The paper emphasizes uplifting stories about prisoners improving their lives. Headlines refer to prisoners who "work for peace" or go from "criminal life to positive futures."

"It was the first time I was in the paper and nobody got shot," said Thomas, the sports editor.

Before they reached San Quentin, many of the editors had only had their names in the news for committing crimes. Each issue is a reminder their lives did not end when they were locked up.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Around the world, people are getting excited about drones, but fear them at the same time.

The one-child rule reduced the number of young people in China. For years, there was only one child for every two parents. Over time, old people started to outnumber young people.

One solution is through universal access to education. With universal access to education, everyone has the opportunity to go to school. It took about a hundred years for the idea of universal access to schooling to spread to countries around the world. People in today's world are much more educated than they were hundreds of years ago. Even though many more kids have access to school than they used to, there is more work to be done. Lawmakers and leaders must make sure that everyone can get high-quality education.

## Education Is An Important Goal

## Lots Of Children In Crisis

Today, 1 in every 9 people on the planet still goes to sleep hungry. That number is about 795 million people. Despite the large number of hungry people in the world, there has also been much progress. Over the last 25 years, the world has fed an extra 2 billion people. Poor countries have almost cut the number of hungry people in half. However, the challenge is to continue the progress.

SEATTLE, Wash. – A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India. It is a part of India that gets hit hard by floods. The farmers there were very poor. They depended on the rice they grew to feed and support their families. When the big monsoon rain storms arrived each year, the rivers would swell. The farms would be threatened by floods.

Often, their crops would be ruined. The farmers would flee to the cities to find jobs to feed their families. By the next year, however, they would return to plant again.

The visit showed us that life is a high-wire act for the world's poorest farmers. They don't have the things farmers in rich countries do. They don't have the best seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems and other technologies. They also have no crop insurance, either. If they could buy insurance, they would be paid money if floods or other events wrecked their crops.

PRINCETON, N.J. – During my class last month, several students stood up and walked out. They joined a protest led by the Black Justice League (BJL). The BJL is a student group that protests the unfair police treatment of African-Americans. There have been several police killings of African-Americans recently.

One demand received national attention. The BJL demanded that the school rename the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. They also want to remove a painting of Woodrow Wilson in the dining hall. The BJL said that Wilson was a racist, so honoring him is disrespectful to African-Americans.

## Many Of Wilson's Laws Helped Workers

At the end of World War I, Wilson helped to create a world peace treaty. The peace agreement called for the formation of "a general association of nations." This became the League of Nations, which then became the larger United Nations.

But many call it a place of unlimited money and hyper-competition, and the pressure to be perfect is extreme.

Earlier this year, the Newport Beach school expelled 11 students accused in a cheating scheme.

Corona del Mar ranks 37th in the state and 222nd in the country. The school is heavily white. Non-white students make up just 16 percent of the school.

"We were always told, 'They're high-profile, be careful,'" she said. "There is really a bad culture over there, and everyone knows it's there."

Growing up, she said, "I heard things like, 'Oh, if you live in Corona del Mar, maybe you'll find somebody to take care of you.' 'I'm on this new (diet), I'm only eating grapefruit for a week.'"

She said, "When you hear that over and over, it just becomes the norm." Everyone thinks they have to go on a diet, become more beautiful and marry a rich man.

She said the pressure on high school girls to look perfect, particularly around prom season, is more intense than when she was a student.

## Players Might Not Stay Long

Players also need to figure out where they will live.

Agents say a few areas may interest Rams players. The areas are popular with pro athletes. Manhattan Beach has beautiful property on the beach. It is close to Los Angeles International Airport. It is also near Inglewood, where the team will play. Calabasas is another popular area. It has huge homes in communities with gates to keep people safe.

LOS ANGELES —Tony Castillo noticed something new. He was skateboarding down Fairfax Avenue one December morning, like he had for more than two years.

A bright red sign with white text stared him in the face. It was clasped to the streetlight pole in front of the sneaker store Flight Club. It looked like a regular street sign, but there were no instructions on parking, driving or walking. Instead, it displayed the words to a rap song. And the words referred to the very spot Castillo had just gone by.

Hours later, the 25-year-old from the Venice, Calif., area found himself sweeping in front of his store next door and gravitating toward the sign again. He set to work in removing the sign from where it was. After about 15 minutes of working, Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.

LONDON — Hoping to sell a piece of art for a fortune? These days, it might help if it's red.

That's just one change in the art market. Buyers from countries such as China have become important. They are molding tastes and driving top-end prices ever higher. This has helped the art market to come roaring back from the lows of a few years ago.

Demand for works by modern masters like [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso) and Matisse seems bottomless. London's leading art sellers Sotheby's and Christie's are both holding auctions of modern works next week. The highest bidder at the auctions goes home with the art. Sales are expected to be brisk and amount to at least $650 million.

Sotheby's put its pieces on view this Thursday in London. There was quite a bit of red visible, especially in the most highly valued works.

SEATTLE — Do businesses have to let their workers practice their religion at work? Should they give workers days off for religious holidays, or time to pray during work hours?

The lawsuit was brought by four workers of Gate Gourmet. The company prepares food for airline passengers. For safety reasons, it doesn't let workers bring their own meals to work.

Yu wrote that her order was based on an earlier court case. In that one, a very Christian woman sued a school district. She claimed her boss told her to give wrong information to another worker. That went against her religion.

WASHINGTON — It began as an irresistible story: A tiny, long-forgotten painting by a French master found in a flea market in West Virginia.

The story behind it was equally irresistible. Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir was at lunch in Paris by the Seine River in 1879 with his girlfriend when he grabbed a napkin and used it to paint her a keepsake.

The painting is called "Paysage Bords de Seine" or "On the Shore of the Seine." It was bought for $7 in a box of odds and ends. But a mystery has unfolded since it was announced in September that the painting would be sold at auction.

But the painting was not listed on an international database for missing and stolen works. This just added to the mystery.

May died in 1951, the same year as the theft. Her will gave nearly all her artworks to the museum. The death seems to have only added to the painting's confusing history.

There are other twists. An insurance company says that it really owns the painting because it paid a claim of $2,500 on it after the theft. But the company also said it will give the work to the museum.

LAS VEGAS, Nev. — A group of Republican governors had an angry message for President Barack Obama this week. They demanded he drop plans to resettle thousands of Syrians in their states.

WASHINGTON — Republicans and Democrats fought for control of the House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday. Both groups are lawmakers. The Republicans are critics of President Obama. The Democrats support the President. He is a Democrat.

If someone falls down and stops breathing, an ambulance is sent for. Now there is also a smartphone app to alert regular people in the area to help.

These people can start life-saving efforts until the professionals get there.

The cell phone app is called PulsePoint. It is one of a number of apps that rescue workers, hospital workers and patients are using to respond to health emergencies and help save lives.

About 500 people, including workers, activists, religious leaders, news crews and local leaders, showed up outside the McDonald's on Fifth Avenue. The protesters chanted "Si Se Puede" ("Yes, We Can" in Spanish). They shouted "Hey, hey, ho, ho $7.25 has got to go."

Our sense of time causes a lot of unusual things to happen. One example is called the "return-trip effect." This is what happens when you go somewhere new for the first time and then return home. When we make a new trip, it sometimes feels that the way back took less time than the way to go there.

A new study looked at the "return-trip effect." It discovered that this actually exists.

One idea is that the "return-trip effect" depends on how people notice time. When you think about time, it seems to take forever. When you are distracted by more interesting things, time passes quickly.

This presents an interesting idea. By paying attention to the present, we may be able to slow our brain's idea of time and make events seem longer.

There may be other reasons for the "return-trip effect" too. One study found that people can experience the effect even when they do not know the route back.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140120_Wealth_inequality.jpg" />BERLIN — A new report says that the 85 richest people in the world have the same amount of money as half of the world's population.

Along with the study, Oxfam published a message on its website. It said the growing gap between rich and poor is weakening democracy.

Oxfam is asking countries to take steps to make sure laws don't make the situation worse. When there is growth and less inequality, the report said, the rules of business work to help the middle classes and the poorest sections of society. But, the report continued, when only the rich are making money, the rules start bending to help only the rich.
RIO DE JANEIRO — A green boat cut through polluted waters in Brazil. It sailed in Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay on Monday. Alongside it were local fishing boats. But instead of grouper and swordfish, this green boat caught plastic bags, soda bottles and an old toilet seat.

There isn't much in the way of trash and sewage services in Rio. And this is a huge city of 6 million people. Tons of garbage and raw waste flow down its rivers daily. They empty into the bay, where Olympic and Paralympic sailing events will be held.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140603_Rip_current.jpg" />CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. — On Wednesday, a small group of scientists and volunteers walked in and out of the ocean. They were there to test a new way of studying the biggest danger to swimmers at the beach: rip currents.

The devices float along more or less as swimmers would. Scientists precisely and repeatedly track where the rip currents take them.

The rip current clearly was happening. A dark patch of water showed where the current split the waves on its way out to sea. The current was weak, though, and several swimmers bobbed cheerfully right in the middle of it.

Rip currents are unpredictable, however.

The currents develop constantly. Nonetheless, one particular beach may develop them only rarely. Dangerously strong ones may be seen for only five to 10 days a year at any one beach.

Experts are now deciding whether or not to change the advice given to swimmers. Some want to continue advising people to swim parallel to, or in the same direction as, the shore. Others feel swimmers should instead be told to float and wait.

Four streetballers are also on the team.

Rodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea for the game. He said he has gotten death threats for his repeated visits to the country. He said money from the game would go to a charity for the deaf in North Korea.

"The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way," Rodman said of Kim. "Marshal" is the leader's official title. "I think that people thought that this was a joke, and Dennis Rodman is just doing this because fame and fortune." Instead, he said, he sees the game as a "birthday present" for Kim and his country.

BILLINGS, Mont. — American Indian tribes in the Western United States are fighting to protect grizzly bears. The tribes are trying to stop national wildlife officials from ending laws that protect the bears. The grizzlies roam the wilderness in and around Yellowstone National Park. The tribes are worried hunters will kill the bears, which they believe are sacred. The bears are very important to their culture.

Ben Nuvamsa is a leader of Arizona's Hopi Tribe. He says his people think of the grizzly bear as an uncle who has strong healing powers. The grizzly is represented in traditional ceremonies.

"We regard him as part of our family, and it's really important to all of us natives to keep him around," Nuvamsa said. "It doesn't matter where the bears are. We pray to them when we see them."

A new decision about whether to take away protection laws for the bears will be made in the next few months.

Salem's witch trials started in January 1692\. Two girls began to have strange fits. They were 9-year-old Elizabeth Parris and her 11-year-old cousin, Abigail Williams. A doctor said they were the victims of witchcraft. Under pressure from officials, the girls blamed three Salem women.

Before long, a dozen girls began having these fits and accusing witches. Eventually, more than 200 people were called witches.

The court's decision created outrage and celebration throughout Alabama. It also split the state's judges into opposing camps.

As usual, Apple has kept its plans to itself. However, it is known that Apple has invented many uses for the man-made sapphire crystals. Its partner in the man-made sapphire business, GT Advanced Technologies, will eventually produce more sapphire than the rest of the world combined, said Eric Virey. He is with the researcher Yole Développement.

But sapphire has a softer side. A sapphire touch-screen can better sense the touch of a finger, experts say. Touch-screens are able to recognize the movements of a user's finger. GT claims that sapphire performed much better than Gorilla Glass in touch testing.

Experts say smartphone makers will be watching Apple as they think about using sapphire in their own phones. Of course, if other smartphone makers start using sapphire, Apple would have to find a new way to wow customers. Could a diamond screen be next?

LOS ANGELES — The sardine fishing boat moved slowly as its tired captain grew more desperate. After 12 hours, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to shore. They hadn't caught a single small, silvery sardine.

Tonight shows you how things have been going, Hanson said. "Not very well."

To blame is the biggest drop in the number of sardines in years. The drop has made the fish rare on the West Coast, which has had a big effect on fisherman. There are now limits on the amount of sardines they are allowed to catch. Scientists say it is affecting the ecosystem. Brown pelicans and sea lions that eat the oily fish could be starving.

If the situation doesn't improve soon, experts warn there could be serious problems. The West Coast's ocean animals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years.

The Pacific sardines rise or go down in numbers depending on natural shifts in the ocean. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are better, they do very well. Their height in the 1940s made Monterey, Calif., one of the world's best places to fish.

Right now, though, Saudi women cannot get a driver's license. And women who do get behind the wheel have been arrested. They've been charged with disorderly conduct or for protesting.

The recently uploaded photos and videos showed women driving on busy streets in the capital city of Riyadh. One clip showed a woman driving in the traditional veil, with only her eyes showing. Passing motorists slowed and gave her a thumbs-up sign.

MECCA, Saudi Arabia — Muslims from across the world poured Sunday into a sprawling tent city in the Saudi desert. It was the start of the yearly Islamic hajj, or religious journey, to this holy city. But the number of the pilgrims this year has been reduced. There are concerns about a virus in the region.

More than 2 million pilgrims left the holy city of Mecca. They went to a huge tent camp in Mina about three miles away. There were about 1 million fewer than last year. In Mina, they began preparations for the hajj with a day of prayer.

The Saudi government cut back on travel papers. The authorities did not give as many to old people, pregnant women and those with long-term illnesses. They were guarding against a new virus related to SARS. It has killed more than 50 people in the kingdom this past year. The Saudi health minister said late Saturday that no cases of the coronavirus infection have been detected among pilgrims.

## Protecting Against The Virus

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A growing number of men are quietly helping steer a campaign to end Saudi Arabia's rule that prevents women from driving. But, by doing so, they risk their jobs and maybe worse in the traditional kingdom.

Some of the men have been questioned by the government. One man was even held. That move scared activists working to put women behind the wheel.

On Saturday, more than 60 women said they drove. The police seemed to do little about it.

"They don't want women driving because it opens the door to a flood of other demands," he said.

King Abdullah has gradually introduced changes in Saudi Arabia. Women are now allowed to sit on the national council and permitted to vote and run in some elections. But, women must still get permission from a male relative to travel, get married, or go to college.

In 1990 and 2011, women were arrested for driving, which led to a global outcry. Instead of arresting women, the government this time has increased pressure on their male supporters.

For many years, some schools have given poorer students free or cheaper breakfasts. The meals would be served in the cafeteria. Schools are now starting to serve breakfast in the classroom instead.

WASHINGTON  — On Wednesday the Obama administration asked the nation's schools to bring about an important change. It called on them to stop sending misbehaving students to court.

Attorney General Eric Holder said well-intentioned "zero-tolerance" rules are often the problem. These rules can bring the criminal justice system into school matters.

Misbehaving students should end up in the principal's office, Holder said. They should not end up in a police station, he added.

African-American students are punished "more harshly and more frequently" than white students, the government said. Discrimination is a real problem when it comes to punishing students, it said.

All school employees, the government said, should be trained in how to manage a classroom. They also need training in how to solve conflicts. And employees, not the police, should take care of ordinary student disciplinary problems.

In response to these findings there already have been changes around the country.

BATES COUNTY, Mo. — There is a lot of pressure on American schools to make students smarter and better prepared. The global job market and scientific research areas are more competitive.

Some education experts say students should go to school all year.  Others say we need longer school days. Some schools have even added Saturday classes.

But a growing number of schools across the country are doing the opposite. They're taking Mondays off.

Students go longer Tuesday through Friday. They still must meet state rules for classroom hours. And teachers still are at school on Monday. They are there to learn, to plan lessons and to train on technology.

"Our ACT scores are the best they've been in 10 years, and our teachers love it," said Chris Fine. He is the superintendent of the Lathrop school district in Clinton County, which went to four days in 2010. It was the first district in Missouri to do so.

Most of these are small, rural districts, such as Miami R-1, about an hour south of Kansas City. Its one school building is surrounded by head-high corn this time of year. It has so few students the boys play football for another school in a nearby town.

## Many Of The School's Students Are Overweight

An A-plus in reading doesn't mean a child can pronounce words with silent letters. An F doesn't say what a child understands.

"Just because they got an A or a 92 on their report card in no way tells a parent exactly what they did," she said. "All that tells you is a number."

Many parts of the country lack nurses in every school.

Nurses help children with ongoing illnesses such as asthma. They treat injuries and help students with physical and emotional issues.

WASHINGTON — Black students are more likely to be suspended from public schools than white kids. Even tiny preschoolers get more suspensions than their white classmates.

Black children represent about 18 percent of children in preschool programs. However, they make up almost half of the preschoolers suspended more than once, the report said. Six percent of the nation's districts with preschools reported suspending at least one preschool child.

HARTFORD, Conn. — State lawmakers are taking threats against schools seriously. They were once seen as childish pranks. Now, lawmakers are proposing stronger punishments.

Most states already have laws that make school threats a felony. A felony is a serious crime. Recently, though, there have been proposals across the United States to make punishments even stronger, said Michael Dorn. He is in charge of the school safety group Safe Havens International.

## Threats Are On The Increase

Dan Domenech says this has been happening since around 2008. Domenech leads the School Superintendents Association. He says money became a problem all over the country at about that time. Schools had to change the way they did things. Instead of cutting school programs, districts started "charging fees for sports events, uniforms, after-school activities, and eventually transportation," he said.

Charging parents for transportation is not a completely new idea. School districts in some states already charged bus fees for students who live very close to their schools. Their families pay for the bus because it is convenient. Families who live farther away usually get free bus rides.

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. — The principal at a middle school in San Francisco, California, put the brakes on a school election. She did not like the results of a vote on who should be part of the student government.

## It Took Time To Catch On

Researchers recently observed 337 kids at a dozen schools in Houston. They found that the average lunch students brought from home was not as healthy as you might think.

## Missing Food Groups

Cafeteria lunches do not come with these treats. Sugary drinks, chips and dessert are not served in schools that follow the National School Lunch Program guidelines.

McCullick is in charge of another school district's food services in Kansas City. She wants to go back to having the flexibility to make decisions at a local level.

McCullick and Kramer belong to the School Nutrition Association. Their group represents school cafeteria workers and the companies that supply their food and equipment.

This food fight has been going on since the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act was passed in 2010. Now, the timeline for that law is coming to an end and the law must be renewed.

CHICAGO — Last year, bullies pushed and called 11-year-old Ronan Schuelke names in the school lunchroom.

Now Ronan is starring in a music video that teaches respect. The video is a take-off on a popular Katy Perry song.

"I think this is something the kids will pick up … and maybe try it," Ronan said of the idea.

## Learning How To Stop Bullying

PIKEVILLE, Ky. — When Shelby Valley High School opened in 1990, coal mining was growing fast. The school had so many students it built more classrooms the next year. Now that the mines are closing, the school is half empty.

It is also bad next door in the coalfields of West Virginia. That state has lost more than one in four students since 1979.

## Sizing Up Schools For Safety

ATLANTA — Officials in Georgia had an urgent plea as the school year neared its close last April. They asked schools to add 30 minutes of exercise into the day.

They sent a letter to school superintendents. It pointed out that only 16 percent of the state's students had passed five tests of physical fitness. The tests measured flexibility, weight, and how well students can run without getting tired, and how many push-ups and curl-ups they can do.

One in five students was unable to pass any of the tests.

Many children in the state are [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — that is, very overweight. They are also weak. So the message was simple: Find a way to get kids moving more.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Students, parents and teachers complain that kids spend too much time taking tests. Just how many hours do they spend each year?

The correct answer is "B," a new study found. The Council of the Great City Schools looked at the amount of testing in 66 of the nation's big-city school districts. The council is a group made up of districts in big cities.

## Some Similar Tests Are Done Twice

## Touring A Real Space Center

SEATTLE — The language of the United Nation's most recent international report on climate change is not exactly what you'd call poetic. The report is crammed with technical details about greenhouse gases, rising sea levels and our atmosphere. And it's not only dense, it's also extremely long: some 2,200 pages.

Seattle oceanographer Gregory Johnson helped write the chapter on marine measurements. But even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the huge work. So when a bad cold kept him in the house one weekend, Johnson decided to distill the report down to its essential meaning. He did this by turning to a centuries-old Japanese art form: haiku. Then, he added his own watercolor paintings.

A group called the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, is in charge of the underwater world. It has been giving governments and companies permission to explore under the oceans. This has worried conservationists, or people who care about taking care of the environment. They believe the ocean's natural state must be protected. They also say not enough is known about the risks of pulling minerals from their natural settings.

So far, most of ISA's permits have been given for a large area of the Pacific Ocean near Mexico and the United States. The area is known to be rich in copper, cobalt and manganese. As part of a plan to help the environment, miners are not allowed to touch some of the areas.

Scientists also want to explore the Western Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. ISA thinks one of those areas could provide up to one-fourth of the world's cobalt, which is a metal.

SANTA ANA, Calif. — Every June, sea lion mothers in California give birth to a pup. Then, the mothers swim off for several days to find food. They return to give milk to their pups.

The sea lions' favorite food are sardines and anchovies. These fishes have many calories and contain much nutrition. Early in 2015, these fishes were hard to find. Mother sea lions had to dive deeper and swim farther to find food. When they returned, they did not have much milk for their pups.

## Care Centers Gear Up To Help

The poison is caused by domoic acid. It is produced by an algae called pseudo-nitzschia. Algae is plant-like but without roots, stems and leaves. It is found in lakes, ponds and the ocean. Algae feeds fish, but when there is too much of it, algae can cause problems. In this case, the domoic acid in pseudo-nitzschia kills brain cells. 

## Scientists Test Group Of Sea Lions

Lefebvre says what scientists find could also help people. Human cases of the poisoning are rare. However, there may be more if warming ocean temperatures continue to support poison blooms of algae.

Almost 4,000 sea lions were brought into California animal centers this year. Justin Viezbicke also works for NOAA. He says that more sea lions likely died at sea. "There were a lot that we just couldn't get to," he says.

SEATTLE, Wash. — For a long time, scientists have said that teenagers should not start school before 8 in the morning. They said it is bad for teens' health and their grades. 

After the trainer died, other trainers stopped going into the water during shows. They still swim with the killer whales while training them.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. — SeaWorld San Diego has been criticized over its treatment of orcas, the giant sea creatures better known as killer whales. On Friday, it announced several changes to make their lives better.

A documentary called "Blackfish" attacks SeaWorld's treatment of its killer whales.

Atchison said visitors will have a range of views. They will be able to "walk alongside the whales as if they were at the shore." Or, they can watch the whales swim underwater or see them from above.

The killer whales at SeaWorld SanDiego in California will not get a happy ending.

A documentary movie was released in 2013 about SeaWorld. It accuses the company of mistreating its killer whales, also called orcas. Now, people who fight for animal welfare are angry. They demand that the San Diego theme park free its 11 killer whales.

However, scientists agree that the orcas probably will never be released to the open seas.

The closest they would get to freedom would be living in ocean coves. The coves would be separated from open water by netting. There, the orcas would be fed and cared for by humans for the rest of their lives.

One famous orca was released to a sea pen. His name was Keiko. He was the whale whose story was featured in the 1993 movie "Free Willy."

Keiko was captured off Iceland in 1979. He was trained to perform at theme parks. After several years at a theme park in Mexico, the whale was transported to a sea pen in Iceland in 1998. 

Mark Simmons was once a SeaWorld trainer who was hired to help with Keiko in Iceland. He said the Keiko experience showed that sea pens are not a safe place for killer whales.

WASHINGTON — Hurricane and Jordan are a pair of Secret Service dogs. On Thursday, they returned to duty after being injured as they helped take down a White House fence jumper. The two quickly became stars.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised the duo. The Secret Service released their pictures and some details about them on Twitter: "Jordan — black/tan Belgian Malinois, brown eyes, age 5, enjoys walks around (the) White House."

Jordan and Hurricane, age 6, were taken to a veterinarian. The two were treated for minor bruising. They were later released and "cleared to return to duty," Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said.

Earnest made it clear the two dogs are working animals. They are unlikely, he said, to mix with the president and his family, or with Bo and Sunny, the Obama family's pets. Bo and Sunny are both Portuguese water dogs and often greet visitors to the mansion.

"The animals that performed so bravely last night," Earnest said, do not normally mix with White House staff and visitors. "I think the individual last night probably saw pretty vividly why we all keep our distance."

## Special Breed For The Job

SVALBARD ISLAND, Norway — The North Pole is a place of stories. Not far from it there is a place that could be the setting for a story itself. On an isolated island in the Arctic Ocean, between the North Pole and Norway, is a vault, or giant safe. It is called the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. The safe is like a huge cave and has enormous rooms inside. It is built into a rocky mountain that is usually covered with snow. Huge steel doors keep out the wind and cold.

Mike Robinson is a vice president at GM. He told a group of government officials that for the "foreseeable future" drivers will still need to be "in control."

People think driverless vehicles will take them places without them doing anything, said Robinson. "These types of driverless systems are a significant distance into the future."

As the Congressional group noted in a report, some cars already do things automatically. Cars are already around that have with automatic brakes or that can park themselves. As these technologies are more common, drivers will need to control the vehicles less.

Someday, vehicles will navigate the road without help from humans. By using electronic sensors and cameras, cars can react to markers on lanes and curbs. Vehicles could move more smoothly. Cars can keep an even distance between vehicles. The traffic system could become safer and less backed-up with cars. People might be able to spend less on fuel.

This is technology that is going to help people, said Robinson.

Earlier this year, the government's traffic safety division said it would look into self-driving vehicles. It is targeting "connected-vehicle technology." The new technology lets self-driving cars "talk" to each other with wireless radio signals. They can send information to each other about what speed they are going and when they change lanes.

Some people may not like the experience of self-driving vehicles. Will customers buy expensive automobiles that don't need drivers to do much?

Robinson said some self-driving technology could happen soon. For instance, tools to help a vehicle automatically stay in the lanes could be here in less than 10 years. Congress should keep letting automakers develop new things for customers, he said. That will lead to better cars.

GM's Robinson said the car company isn't thinking about what to charge for the cars at this point.

A glimpse of the coming revolution can be seen in the cars on display this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Hidden under their hoods and dashboards are sensors. The sensors are the first steps toward self-driving cars. Already, cars can park themselves, slam on the brakes to avoid crashes and adjust steering to stay centered in a lane.

The change will go well beyond who is — or isn't — at the controls. For a century, cars have been symbols of freedom and wealth. Passengers of the future may someday view vehicles as just another form of public transportation, like buses.

Automakers will find themselves fighting off new challengers. Google is already building a fleet of experimental self-driving cars.

Schwartz believes that California may set aside lanes for self-driving vehicles within 10 years.

This transformation will change how cars are designed, said Harald Belker, a former Mercedes-Benz designer. Belker now creates cars for movies set in the future, including "Iron Man 2" and "Total Recall."

Gasoline may give way to hydrogen, batteries or both. Or there could be some new power source.

WASHINGTON — Where some Senate candidates live could matter in the next election as much as how they vote.

Some of the candidates list Washington, D.C., not the states where they are running, as their home address. Others moved into their states just before the election. Some argue that they're just using the states as a way to get into the Senate.

## Louisiana

When Republican Senator Thad Cochran registered as a candidate, he said he lived in Washington. In February, he changed that to Oxford, Mississippi, where he owns a home.

Republican challenger Chris McDaniel said Cochran was spending too much time in Washington. McDaniel promised he would return to the state frequently. He lost the Republican primary election to Cochran.

ORLANDO, Fla.— Fake service-dog certificates, vests and harnesses for ordinary pets are showing up all over. Supporters of the disabled say this is creating big headaches for those who truly need their canine companions.

The problem has gotten so bad that the nation's largest service-dog group launched a campaign last week. It's asking the U.S. Department of Justice to take action.

Service dogs are trained to assist people with disabilities. People know that these dogs wear harnesses or vests, said Paul Mundell of Canine Companions for Independence.













PHARM Dog may be the only program of its kind. It is just for farmers with physical problems or sickness. It lets them stay on their farms.

Julia is Sesame Street's newest Muppet. She has bright orange hair and big green eyes. Sometimes, it takes her a long time to answer questions. Julia has autism.

Some people might find that strange. That is because boys are almost five times more likely than girls to be autistic.

Should Sesame have made its new character a boy?

## Many Disagree About Autism

The website does not explain everything about autism. Instead, it shows Julia playing with Elmo. It says that when she plays with a toy bus, "she especially likes spinning the wheels around and around."

Sesame also shows Julia's autism in the way she communicates with other Muppets. In one scene, she is swinging with Elmo. Elmo introduces her to his friend Abby, but Julia does not look in Abby's direction. This causes Abby to say, "Your friend doesn't like me."

That is not true, Elmo responds. "It's just hard for her to talk when she's swinging," he explains. Once Julia finishes swinging, Abby tries again, and asks if they can play together. Julia just looks down.

Again, Elmo has the answer. "Elmo's daddy told Elmo that Julia has autism," he says. "So she does things a little differently. Sometimes Elmo talks to Julia using fewer words and says the same things a few times."

NEW YORK — Most Americans born since the mid-1960s have a favorite "Sesame Street" story. Jennifer Kotler Clarke watched her favorite show on a black-and-white TV. She was a child at the time.

Most people thought that it was written by William Shakespeare, the famous writer who lived in the 1500s. But they were not sure. New research now says it is almost certainly the work of Shakespeare.

A writer named John Fletcher seems to have helped write the play. Experts think that Fletcher co-wrote three plays with William Shakespeare late in Shakespeare's life. One of those plays was similar to "Double Falsehood."

Still, the authors of the new study said it was very likely that the play was written by Shakespeare.

## Shakespeare Is Still A Mystery

In North Carolina this summer, more people are being bitten by sharks than ever before. However, that does not mean your chance of getting bitten is increasing. In fact, a new study says the risk is dropping all over the world.

## Many More People In The Water

## Surfing, Scuba Diving More Popular

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — South Florida fisherman Viktor Hluben pulls in his catch after a hard fight. On the end of his line tonight is a 14-foot great hammerhead shark.

A group of friends drag the big fish onto a beach by the tail. They take photos and video while the shark lies still. Then they cut the fishing line and haul the bloody shark into waist-deep water.

In the weeks after, a YouTube video of the event got more than 1 million hits. Hluben and his friends received worldwide attention.

## Sharks Could Suffer

Fishers are not supposed to take pictures before they let the animals go, said Shiffman. He also says fishers don't have to release sharks from up on the beach.

It's a mystery of the sea: How many great white sharks are near California's coast?

Some scientists say the population is large and healthy. Others say it is alarmingly small. Nobody is certain. But the question has become very important.

"This is a tough one," California fish and wildlife official Adrianna Shea said. She noted that scientists are  divided on the issue.

## Things Can Go Wrong

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — "Yeehaw!" the sport fishermen yelled when they saw the fins above the gray water off Huntington Beach.

The chopped mackerel and sardines had worked as bait. The fight was on. The cameras were running.

The men on the boat were part of a reality TV show called "The Professionals."

They hooked the giant mako shark. Then Texan Jason Johnston got strapped down to reel it in. He battled the beast for 2-1/2 hours. The shark swam almost a mile, thrashing and jumping 20 feet in the air. The fishermen finally pulled it to the side of the boat and tied it up with a steel cable.

## Breaking A Record

But plenty of people wondered why they had to kill such a magnificent animal.

Ben Ahadpour owns the marina the fisherman used. He said the captain of the boat, Matt Potter, knew the dock rules said you could not bring in sharks.

"He shouldn't have done that," Ahadpour said. "They can bring it up close, take a picture and let the shark go."

David McGuire, the director of a group that fights for the protection of sharks, was shocked.

So many shows about sharks focus on the terror rather than the science, he complained. "These kind of reality shows are not reality. The reality is we're overfishing sharks, and this macho big-game attitude should be a relic of the past."

Keith Poe tags and releases sharks for conservation groups. He said that most people release sharks these days, but might keep one if it seems like it might be a record breaker.

"The general sportfishing community would say it's acceptable."

Potter, whose nickname is "Mako Matt," does not buy any of the criticism. "It's just like any other fishing. The state limit for mako is two per person per day."

Wing Hop Fung Ginseng &amp; China Products had three bins of dried shark fins left. One was marked with a sign: "Father's Day Special! 20 percent off. $999 a pound."

As for Gian, she still had a lot of fins to sell.

"Maybe we'll reduce the prices even more, or eat them ourselves." Or maybe, she said, they'll just "move them to a state where they are still legal."
It was an 8-foot-long tiger shark, one of the fiercest sharks around. The tiger shark is probably responsible for most of the 14 attacks in Hawaii in 2013. Eight of these happened near Makena. The fisherman let go of his net and ran down the shore, shouting for swimmers to get out of the water.

"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said. "Tiger sharks — you don't play with them."

Karen O'Brien is a 49-year-old tourist from Toronto who said she would only go into the water as high as her waist. Last year, O'Brien snorkeled off the small island of Molokini. Then she read that the kayak fisherman who died was also attacked near Molokini. O'Brien then decided to stop snorkeling there.

## Tremendous Risks

ROME — Crews have pulled the cruise ship Costa Concordia from the rocks off the Italian island where it sank. The shipped had been wrecked upon the rocks for the last 20 months. It is set to be removed from the shoreline by mid-2014, experts said Tuesday.

The operation to straighten the 300-meter, 114,000-ton ship took 19 hours. Engineers had hoped it could be done in 10 to 12 hours. But getting it right was more important that doing it fast. The ship is longer than three football fields and weighs more than 28,000 elephants.

"I am relieved and I am a bit tired. I will have a beer and go to sleep. I am sending a kiss to my wife," the South African-born Nick Sloane said as he emerged from the barge from which he commanded the operation. He is in charge of pulling the wreck out of the sea.

The body of the ship was lifted using steel cables and tanks. They were attached to the side that was above water. The tanks were filled with water. They weight of the tanks helped pull up the wreck.

## Next, Refloating The Ship

Straightening the Concordia was a major engineering project. The risk was that the rusting hull could snap or sink entirely. Then the ship could not be saved, or salvaged. The waters surrounding the wreck could have been badly polluted. It would have been a disaster.

"It could not have gone any better," Porcellacchia said. Italian Civil Protection agency chief Franco Gabrielli attacked people who thought the worst would happen. Some thought a lot of sewage would have been released from the ship.

Instead, poisonous liquids were not released. Fuel was removed from the Concordia two months after its shipwreck. Still, leftover fuel, chemicals and rotting food were thought to have dirtied the seawater inside the body of the ship.

## Sirens Blare As Ship Righted

The loss of snowpack is "definitely going to be a problem," said Jay Lund, the director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at University of California, Davis. But if it's managed well, Lund said it should not be a disaster.
## "Cloud Of Uncertainty" Lifted

WASHINGTON — Some Americans might not even notice that the government won't be completely open on Tuesday. But, many government workers and average Americans are likely to be affected.

On Monday night the House and Senate were unable to agree on a plan to temporarily pay for the work of the government. The nation now faces a changed scene. Some of the services immediately affected are largely invisible, but are still important.

Here's how the shutdown will affect some government services:

## Lady Liberty, Museums, Liberty Bell Shut

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — Clare Cogan and Daniel Mohally stood sadly inside the Yosemite Visitors Bureau. They were trying to figure out how to save their honeymoon.

The couple from Ireland had flown to the United States last week for a honeymoon that started in San Diego and will end in San Francisco. In between was a side trip to Yosemite. It was supposed to be the highlight of their trip.

Yosemite National Park was nearly empty on Wednesday. A bitter battle in Washington between Republicans and Democrats shut down parts of the federal government for the first time in 17 years. All 401 National Park Service sites were closed.

There aren't as many visitors in early October as in the height of the summer. Still, it is normally a busy time at Yosemite.

"It's when everybody who doesn't come in the summer comes," chuckled Tollefson. As many as 20,000 people a day would normally be in the park, many of them foreigners who time their trips long in advance.

"They don't understand it," said Jan Quistad, a retired principal who works at the front desk of the visitors bureau in Oakhurst. In a typical week, the bureau will receive 60 visitors. This week, it was overrun by 200 a day. Many of them were foreign visitors who didn't know where else to turn.

Gediman said he had just met a couple from Israel who had planned a 14-day trip.

## Hotel Workers Worried About Their Jobs

In January, Johnson's group found 67 sea lions stranded on the beach. Normally, they would see just one or two sea lions in the entire month.

"It's a real shock to us," he added.

A shower of meteors — shooting stars — is supposed to peak tonight. In just a few minutes these teens will release a balloon that will rise to the edge of space. Their goal is to photograph a shooting star.

A payload is something carried by an aircraft or spacecraft. Their balloon's payload is a padded lunchbox. As the first stars come out, the students secure the lunchbox to the bottom of the balloon. A camera to record the meteors is inside. Two GPS trackers are mounted on the outside to help them find the payload later.

Over the last four years, this tight-knit group has launched 53 balloons. It's a long-running science project with a twist: part science experiment, part backcountry adventure.

"Five, four, three, two, one," they chant, and the balloon begins to rise.

There is quiet, and a feeling of wonder. Then, the balloon disappears into the night.

"For us it does not matter who they're targeting," said Kaleka. He is a former Milwaukee police officer and teacher. His father was one of six people killed in 2012 when a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. A white supremacist thinks that white people are superior to everyone else. Kaleka said the Sikhs should not tell people they are not Muslims. When people are using hate speech, "we cannot be on the sidelines," he said

As a result, some Sikhs have been the victims of violence.

In 2013, a Wisconsin, man was charged with a hate crime. He was accused of setting fire to a store owned by a Sikh-American.

Some single-sex colleges have problems, according to David L. Warren. But they are not doomed, he said. Warren is president of a group that represents colleges and universities.

Many of the schools will be able to do well in the coming years, he said. However, the people who run the schools will need to show good leadership. They will also need smart business plans and interesting classes, Warren added.

The survival of women's colleges is important, said Michele Ozumba. She is president of a group that supports women's colleges. The schools can help women become leaders, she said. Minorities and students who are the first in their families to go to college may especially need women's colleges, she said.

ORLANDO, Fla. — First came the cracking sounds. Then windows started blowing out. And before they knew it, guests felt the ground beneath their Lake County hotel near Disney World in Florida sink into the ground.

The United Nations dedicated a memorial on Wednesday to the millions of victims of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

The new memorial is called The Ark of Return. It remembers the  15 million African men, women, and children who died under slavery. It also honors the millions of people forced into slavery to work on plantations in the Americas

## Reminder Of A Cruel Journey

UNITED NATIONS — Caribbean countries face plenty of problems. There's rising unemployment, high crime and an unending health crisis.

But almost every Caribbean leader who spoke at the United Nation last week brought up one issue: paying for the damages of slavery. The countries were European colonies during the African slave trade. They want money, or reparations, for the descendants of African slaves.

The fight is many years old. Black scholars and others across the United States, Caribbean and Africa have unsuccessfully sought money from Britain, France and the Netherlands. They want the European countries to pay for supporting kidnapping, enslaving and selling Africans. But their idea was never backed by most citizens or political leaders. Now that has changed.

## Caribbean Leaders Band Together

Ralph Gonsalves is prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. He is one of the leaders of the movement.

Beckles recently published a book. In it he argues that Britain built its economic empire on slave labor. The effects of slavery continue to be seen in the problems Caribbean countries have with improving their fortunes, the book said.

It is unclear whether other nations will join the Caribbean's call. On Monday, the U.N. unveiled the winning design of a memorial at U.N. headquarters to honor the victims of slavery.

Chirac was the French president when Haiti was celebrating its 200th birthday almost 10 years ago. Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide demanded that France repay Haiti for the amount it was forced to pay for its freedom in 1804. Aristide had sent Paris a bill for the amount, down to the last penny, of $21,685,135,571.48. Chirac quickly said no.

Blacks in America have had no more success than their counterparts. Attempts to have the courts force the U.S. to pay reparations for slavery have gone nowhere.

Still, Heather Russell, a professor of Caribbean and African-American literature, says she is "cautiously hopeful" about the Caribbean Community's latest efforts.

"You have 15 heads of government who have signed on," said Russell, a Jamaica native. "This issue has never been squarely put on the table."

Verene Shepherd is a historian and who has fought a long time for reparations. She said people are more aware about the affects of slavery today.

The risks of becoming a slave are high in many African countries, the report said. Wars, poverty and dishonest governments make it easy for some to fall into slavery.

Boat captains and workers spoke of the dangers at Thai fishing businesses. Boat captains rarely checked the ages of workers. Verite found children who were forced to fish. Many workers said they do their jobs without rest, and hardly get any food and water. Fishing companies did not allow them to speak with their families or friends.

In fact, Nestle is already being sued. In August, pet food buyers filed a lawsuit in court against the company. It claimed that fish in Fancy Feast cat food was caught with slave labor in Thailand. It is one of several lawsuits against U.S. companies bringing seafood in from Thailand.

Some of the lawsuits mention reports from the AP. The news service connected slave-caught fish with giant food sellers. Some that were mentioned include Wal-Mart, Sysco and Kroger. It also found the fish in popular brands of canned pet food, including Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. The seafood can turn up as calamari at expensive restaurants, or as fake crab in a sushi roll. It can also be found in packages of frozen fish that people buy in grocery stores. The U.S. companies all said they are working to prevent it.
WASHINGTON — In 1794, a Portuguese ship taking about 400 slaves from Africa to South America crashed off the coast of South Africa. About half of the slaves died in the rough waters. The slaves who survived were sold to a new owner. Then they were sent to work on sugar plantations in the South American country of Brazil.

Now, two items found in the wreck of the slave ship São José-Paquete de Africa are coming to Washington. One is an iron ballast, which is a weight that is carried on a ship to keep it stable. The other is a wooden pulley block. It is part of a machine used to lift heavy objects onto a boat. The items will be displayed next year at the new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. They will be featured in an exhibit on slavery.

"These will be part of the list of 'I've got to see this,'" said Lonnie Bunch, one of the museum's leaders. He was in South Africa on Monday, where it was announced that the Iziko Museums would loan the artifacts to the new museum.

The items represent a significant addition to the newest Smithsonian museum, which is set to open next year.

The National Museum of African American History and Culture was created by Congress in 2003. The $540 million building will open with 11 exhibitions, including the one on slavery.

The agreement to loan the items is important to the Slave Wreck Project. The program started in 2008 to learn more about the slave trade by studying shipwrecks.

"It's a great collaboration that brings us across the ocean," Gardullo said. Their collaboration involves "engaging in these conversations and looking at new ways to do this work."

The São José shipwreck was first discovered in the 1980s. At first, experts thought the ship was an older Dutch boat. In 2008, researchers with the Slave Wreck Project chose the site as its first undertaking. They began to explore the underwater location and conduct research in the cities the ship was thought to have visited.

Since 2010, researchers have discovered documents in Portugal that told who the ship's owners were. The documents also indicate what type of cargo the ship was carrying when it left Africa. There is also evidence that the ship's captain bought a slave from a local leader called a sheikh.

Sledding is risky, said Dubuque's city lawyer. "It's not unusual for people to talk about their accidents or near accidents along with the fun times they've had."

Thousands of kids across the country are involved in sledding accidents each year. Between 1997 and 2007, nearly 230,000 of them ended up in emergency rooms.

Some cities have not found it easy to ban sledding, however.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a group of doctors that studies young people, says that sleepiness is a serious health problem for teenagers.

WASHINGTON — Flashback to the 1940s. The setting is a jazz club. A saxophonist performs on stage wearing his sunglasses at night. "I'm cool," he says, relaxed in the moment.

Over the past five years, curators at the National Portrait Gallery have been working on this. They set out to examine how that idea of cool has shaped American arts and culture. A new exhibit opening Friday is about the image of cool. It is comprised of 100 photographs of people who defined cool as a word for rebellion, self-expression, charisma, edge and mystery.

"American Cool" traces the idea further back to the "granddaddies of cool," Walt Whitman and Frederick Douglass. It then unfolds through the generations, leading to Jay-Z, Johnny Depp and Madonna.

"These are the successful cultural rebels of American culture," said Joel Dinerstein, a professor and jazz scholar at Tulane University. He co-curated the show and teaches a college course on the history of being cool.

SEATTLE — A new study from the University of Washington (UW) shows that the number of smokers worldwide has never been higher. Further, the number of cigarettes smoked is at an all-time high.

Between 1980 and 2012, the number of adults who smoke rose from 721 million to nearly 1 billion, reports the study. It was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The number of cigarettes smoked around the world jumped from about 5 trillion to 6.25 trillion.

The study is one of the largest ever to examine global tobacco use. It shows that there were remarkable drops in smoking rates in the United States and other wealthy countries. But they have been offset by a growing smoking population in poorer parts of the world.

The study showed "how much further the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries, still has to go," said Matthew Myers. He is president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C.

The rise in the number of smokers reflects population growth. But it is also a result of tobacco companies advertising and promoting cigarettes heavily in poorer nations, experts say. Nations such as China and Indonesia in particular have grown and started smoking more.

## Smoking Numbers

Most snakebites come from snakes native to the United States and happen because of people's bad judgment, Bradley Lawrence said. He is the zoo's reptile and amphibian supervisor. Native snakes are from the United States. Exotic snakes come from other countries.

"Most of the time it's native venomous snakes that somebody has decided to mess around with, late at night," he said. People say, "Oh, look, there's a snake. Let's pick it up!'"

The most recent call for help came in January. A man was bitten by his African bush viper. It is an exotic species that has no antivenom.

Although many younger Americans like what he did, an opinion poll showed that most people do not.

One of them is Snowden's lawyer in Russia, Anatoly Kucherena. "Edward loves America and he would definitely like to return home," he said.

WASHINGTON — Edward Snowden is a courageous American hero. He will be remembered as one long after the "war on terror" is over. By then our government will have some new excuse for violating Americans' rights and the rights of the rest of the world.

Snowden's attempt to avoid facing U.S. criminal charges has become a game of hide-and-seek across the globe. And Hong Kong and Russia are not helping the U.S. government win.

U.S. authorities want to arrest Snowden on charges of spying and theft. The U.S. canceled his passport.

Snowden is being helped by WikiLeaks. That is a group which has made a reputation by leaking government secrets on the Internet. WikiLeaks' leader,  Julian Assange, has been living under protection in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for a year. He is trying to avoid legal problems of his own.

## Seeking Protection In Ecuador

Instead, Hong Kong let Snowden fly to Russia on Sunday. This upset the Obama administration. Hong Kong authorities said they had asked the United States for more information regarding the request to send Snowden back and could not legally stop him from leaving.

Hong Kong is a Chinese territory. The United States has told both Hong Kong and China that it is upset.  U.S. officials said that they were answering Hong Kong's questions when Snowden left.

Once Snowden got to Moscow, things became even more interesting. There is no direct flight from Moscow to Ecuador. Reports said that Snowden was taking a flight to Cuba on Monday.

The gate where the flight was boarding was mobbed by reporters and television cameras. Some reporters even booked seats on the flight. But Snowden was not on the airplane.

"I would urge them to live by the standards of the law," he said.

But Russian officials were being tight-lipped.

Heading the ball in soccer can be dangerous. If a player heads the ball too hard, they could damage their brain and suffer from a concussion. Most people thought heading the ball was the most common way a soccer player got a concussion. Now scientists think other activities in soccer matter more.

The scientists found that heading the ball was still the most common single activity that led to a concussion. However, most concussions were caused by other forms of physical play. This rough play includes crashing into another player while defending, chasing a loose ball or receiving a pass.

## Girls At Higher Risk Of Concussions Than Boys

SOCHI, Russia — After a remarkable showing at the costliest Olympics ever, Russia celebrated. Seventeen days of sports and global unity came to a close on Sunday night with a grand farewell show.

Winners of Russia's record 13 gold medals marched into the stadium. They carried Russia's white, blue and red flag, which was raised alongside the Olympic flag. Athletes streamed by their hundreds into the stadium, dancing and taking "selfies," pictures of themselves, with their phones. Earlier, giant screens flashed highlights of their Olympic feats.

Russia's athletes topped the Sochi medals table, both in golds and total — 33. It was a stunning turnaround from the 2010 Vancouver Games. There, it won just three golds and 15 total. People began doubting Russia's winter sports power. This time, Russia's bag of Sochi gold was the biggest haul since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was a group of republics controlled by Russia. It's breakup gave many Eastern European and Central Asian countries their freedom.

In an interview on Saturday, Bach singled out Ukraine's victory in the women's biathlon relay. He called it "really an emotional moment" of the games. He praised Ukrainian athletes for staying to take part in the games even though many had just died in protests back home.

"Seeing your capital burning, and feeling this responsibility, and then winning the gold medal," he said, "this really stands out for me."
On the video test, they correctly named about a fourth of the feelings at the beginning of camp. After five days at camp, the students got 31 percent correct.

## Showing An Improvement

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Sodas and other sugary drinks sold in California will have to have warning labels. That is, if a new bill announced Thursday passes. If it does, California would be the first state to require such labels.

The bill would require the warning on the front of all drinks with added sweeteners that have 75 or more calories in every 12 ounces. A calorie is a unit of energy in food. The label would read: "STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay." [Obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) means having an unhealthy level of extra body fat. Diabetes is a disease that involves having too much blood sugar.

Democratic Senator William Monning came up with the bill. He said there is clear research showing the link between sugary drinks and these diseases. He added that the label was written by a national panel of experts.

"We agree that obesity is a serious issue," the group said in a statement. But it called Monning's bill "misleading." It said just 6 percent of calories in the average American's diet come from soda, fruit, sports and energy drinks. Sweets and desserts make up 11 percent. In fact, most calories are eaten in the form of fats, oils and starches in food.

The medical groups supporting Monning's bill came back with their own numbers. They said sugary drinks are the largest source of new calories in Americans' diet in the last 30 years. They also said one soda a day makes a child 55 percent more likely to be overweight. It can raise the risk of diabetes by 26 percent.

Monning said the warning labels were similar to efforts to control alcohol and tobacco. He didn't agree with suggestions that the labels would be another example of the government telling people how to live.

"It is not the responsibility of industry to protect the public health. It is the responsibility of government," he said, noting that people could still choose to drink the drinks.

Duke University researchers looked at a program called Fast Track. The program was started in the early 1990s. It was for children who were identified by teachers and parents to be at high risk for developing behavioral problems.

WASHINGTON — It's an old story: Braving unknown dangers, a team of explorers settles a wild frontier. And then — almost as quickly — bureaucrats tie things up with red tape.

The FAA has so far been very limited in what it can do: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation.

Some of the "old laws of the sea" perhaps could be applied to space, he said. "Maybe we should go back and look at" what was worked out back then.
Going to the stars is often regarded as the future of human travel. Scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit space beyond Earth. He said, "Earth is humanity's cradle, but you're not meant to stay in your cradle forever." However, in the century since this vision was proposed, we have learned things about the universe and ourselves. The things suggest moving out into space may not be our future after all.

A big problem is the size of the universe. Its size was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. For example, Tau Ceti is one of the closest stars to us. It is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. We can't simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship. A spaceship cannot support humans for the centuries it would take to travel. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to make an ark. The ark would need to be big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.

However, the ark would have to be small enough to move at a fairly high speed. A bigger ark needs more fuel to slow itself down on reaching its final stop. For that reason and others, smaller is better. However, smallness creates problems for balancing the ecosystem. Both a big and a small ark have problems, so we would have to find a way to design a medium-sized craft.

Still, humans can adjust. All the problems outlined so far might be solved. People enclosed in an ark might cross space successfully to a nearby planetary system. However, even if they do, their problems will have just begun.

Overall, there are many problems with traveling through space in an ark. There are other problems with trying to live on another planet. While it is not impossible, the project would have very poor chances of success. 

## Earth Needs To Be Sustainable First

Scientists hope that Voyager 2 will fill many gaps in our understanding. The spacecraft was also launched in 1977. It is near the edge of the heliosphere. It is traveling a different path. Voyager 2 is expected to reach interstellar space sometime within the next several years.

Voyager 2 has a working plasma science instrument.

LOS ANGELES — For many years, finding Spanish-language books in the U.S. was tough.

Bookstores stocked few titles, and those they carried were very expensive. A paperback copy of "Don Quixote" in the original Spanish could easily cost three times the price of a deluxe hard-bound translation in English. If, that is, it could be found at all.

Booksellers said the high prices were unavoidable. Importing books printed in Spain and Latin America was expensive.

## A Hunger For Spanish Books

## E-Explosion Of Spanish Titles

The growth in Spanish-language digital books has also helped sales of printed books in Spanish. Overall, foreign publishers have grown more hopeful about the U.S. market.

The book distributor Independent Publishers Group has seen sales of Spanish-language print books go way up. Sales have jumped by 40 percent over the last five years.

And in July, the paperback version of "Inquebrantable," the autobiography of recording artist Jenni Rivera, hit the No. 1 spot on all of Amazon.com, outselling every other book on the website.

College athletes may get through the season without a concussion. But they may not be completely in the clear, a new study suggests.

The findings may show that a season of small hits may prompt changes in the brain. There has been other evidence of this. Those brain changes cause problems with memory, mood or ability to learn years later. The changes come even though none of the individual hits are hard enough to have to see a doctor.

Players may heal during the off-season. Scientists are still trying to figure out how easily the brain recovers from injury. They also want to know whether there is a point where the damage adds up or cannot be reversed.

WASHINGTON — Millions of starfish are dying all along the West Coast. Some congressmen from Washington state are trying to do something about it. They want to find out the cause of the deaths. They say it is time for Congress to get involved.

Rangers at Olympic National Park first noticed the problem in 2013. The disease has affected 20 different types of starfish, which are also known as sea stars.

The sea stars get wounds on their bodies and begin curling up. Then they lose their legs and eventually the sea stars turn into mush.

The disease is called sea star wasting syndrome. It is shown by a strange twisting of the starfish's arms and white marks on its skin. The animal dies quickly after its arms fall off and its body softens. The disease has killed huge numbers of sea stars.

## States Have Different Programs

NEW YORK — Romance can be rocky, and no one knows that better than the Statue of Liberty. Over and over, Lady Liberty has been separated from those who love her. The most recent breakup was caused by an uninvited guest. Her name was Sandy and she stormed through, leaving heartbreak and ruin behind her.

Since Oct. 29, 2012, the statue had stood alone in New York Harbor. But the painful separation is over at last. On Thursday, visitors returned to the Statue of Liberty for the first time since the superstorm shut her down. It was the third closure since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

"I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little bit tired of reopening and closing the Statue of Liberty," said David Luchsinger, the statue's superintendent. "I think this time we'll just leave it alone," he said with a laugh.

As he spoke, hundreds of visitors swarmed Lady Liberty. Her home, Liberty Island, is a short ferry ride from Manhattan. The island's only resident is the 127-year-old woman who symbolizes freedom, from her shimmering torch to the broken chain at her feet.

## Visitors Quietly Stare At Her

In the 19th century, one of the six Caryatids was removed by an English nobleman. Today it stands in the British Museum. The other five were put in the Acropolis Museum in 1979  to protect them from air pollution, smoke and acid rain. They were replaced by copies.

## A Makeover For Statues

If it works, the children could live longer while scientists try to cure the birth defect known as HLHS, hypoplastic left heart syndrome.

The Mayo study could help the 19,000 children born each year with other heart problems. But the doctors at Mayo are focused on babies who need the most help now.

Christina DeShaw was pregnant with twins when she leanned that the left side of her daughter's heart was not growing properly.

DeShaw and her husband, Brad Weitl, sought help from the Mayo Clinic for their baby. They named her Ava Grace.

Children with problems on the left side of the heart must have three difficult operations. The first comes days after they are born. Doctors rebuild the heart so that the right side can do the work of both sides.

The second and third operations are much safer. Doctors change how the blood runs through the body. They make it go straight to the lungs so the heart can work less.

## Making Stem Cells Work Better

Nelson dedicated himself to finding a cure for HLHS when he was studying to become a heart surgeon for children. It made him sad that babies had to go through three heart surgeries and would often come back as young children with heart damage. The damage could not be fixed, and the children usually could not find a new heart in time to save them.

Some research suggested that half the children with HLHS don't make it to their fifth birthday, Nelson said. But there are also some living into their early 20s.

"What happened to your face?" Jones asked a girl who arrived tonight with marks on her cheeks. The teenager said she had been fighting with classmates who bullied her.

A tall young man approached Jones to say "hi." The young man had been beaten with a gun a few days earlier in a robbery. "How you doing, baby?" Jones said.

But the drill team keeps going. Jones also does all she can to keep the children in school. She meets with their parents or other adults. She wants to be sure someone is watching over them.

"This whole thing has to do with saving lives, not just marching in front of the cameras," she said.

Her grandfather bought uniforms and three drums. Jones could not afford to rent a hall. So the drill team practiced under bridges. They practiced in parks or on streets. Robert, her high school sweetheart, played drums as Jones taught dance steps and led the team through marches and exercises.

Jones attended college for two years. Then she dropped out to care for her grandfather. She and Robert oversaw drill team practices, fundraisers and shows in their free time.

Last year Jones quit her job so she could work full time for the drill team. Her daughter, LaQuicia, 23, volunteers time to choreograph routines; her oldest son, Robert Jr., 17, helps his father on drums at practices.

The Sophisticated Sisters have to follow Jones' strict rules: Children must complete 200 hours of community service a year, keep up with their homework and keep up at least a C average.

Jones takes the older children on college tours. She often pays for the trips herself. Destiny Bush, now 24, went on one of the tours, visiting three universities with Jones after joining the drill team as an eighth-grader.

The 95-million-year-old dinosaur is known as Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. New evidence suggests it spent much of its life in water.

At 50 feet long, Spinosaurus was likely the largest flesh-eating dinosaur to ever have walked the Earth. It was nine feet longer than Tyrannosaurus rex.

Spinosaurus had a bony "sail" on its back, which stayed above the water as it swam. The spiny sail would have helped it to glide through the water. The beast could thus keep moving without alerting other animals to its enormous presence.

They followed the sound of the helicopter's whirring blades. They also listened to scratchy updates from rebels on a walkie-talkie.

## The Noise Of War

On a recent day in an Aleppo vegetable market, a warplane's low rumble was heard. It stopped all business and conversation.

People forgot about the unripe almonds and lettuce. Everyone turned their faces upward to track the plane by its sound.

People did not return their attention to the everyday particulars of life until the rumble had faded. The plane was now the concern of another Aleppo neighborhood.

"If it had been a helicopter, they would watch it till it dropped the barrel," Saleh Laila said. Then "cars would start driving into each other and people would run, trying to get away."

A couple of charred and stripped vehicles mark the entrance of Aleppo.

The helicopters attack day and night along with warplanes and big guns. There are also regular clashes between government and rebel forces. The violence has transformed the area from one that was full of people and life into one with entire neighborhoods abandoned.

More than two-thirds of the city's population is estimated to have escaped and gone north. They go to Turkey. If they are not allowed into the country, they stay along its border in rundown refugee tents.

There is a November deadline for getting rid of Syria's ability to make the weapons. All materials that could be used to make such weapons would have to be destroyed by the middle of next year. One U.S. official called the deadlines ambitious.

U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed the U.S.-Russian agreement. He called it an "important, concrete step" toward the goal of destroying the weapons. But he warned that "the United States remains prepared to act" if the peaceful solution does not work.

## Russia Calling The Shots?

## Trying To Influence U.S. Public Opinion

Syria is in the middle of a bloody civil war. More than 1.5 million people have left the country to escape the violence. More than 70,000 people have been killed. That number doesn't even include all the soldiers who have died. The rest of the world is looking to the United States. There is pressure for the United States to act. That pressure is getting worse now that there are signs the Syrian government may be using chemical weapons.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. has also seen evidence of chemical weapons in Syria. However, Obama said he still needed more information. If it is true that the Syrians are poisoning their own people, Obama may face a very tough decision: should the United States send troops to Syria?

In August 2012, Obama sent Syria a warning. He said using chemical weapons on their people would be crossing a "red line." He did not explain what he meant by "red line." However, political experts say it may mean the U.S. military would try to help throw out the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.

"If they're going to strike, let them strike once and for all" and get rid of the government, grumbled Um Hafiz. She had fled with her husband and five children from their village near Syria's southern city of Daara in January.

Others said Sunday they worried that Obama's decision would make Syrian President Bashar Assad more brave. He might even dare to attack Zaatari, they said. The camp is a major recruiting ground for rebel fighters. It is located about five miles inside Jordan. It is also a dusty, sun-stricken stretch of tents and metal huts.

"People are angry, but when the Americans do attack, we will be happy they do," said Raad Zoubi, 23. Zoubi has lived in the camp for the past year.

MAJDAL ANJAR, Lebanon — Thirteen-year-old Anas walks through rain, mud and cold to go to class in a tent along Lebanon's border with Syria. He goes to school with 20 other Syrian children. The tent is home to a Syrian family. It also serves as a classroom for four hours each day.

## Trying To Catch Up

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is getting a special cargo ship ready to be used to destroy hundreds of tons of deadly poison gas and chemicals. The materials were collected in Syria after a deadly gas attack last summer. The attacks made people all over the world angry.

Two machines have been put on the ship called the Cape Ray, officials said on Thursday. The machines use water or bleach to destroy the chemicals that produce nerve gases.

Syria is in the middle of a civil war. That means that the biggest challenge could be moving the deadly material to the U.S. naval ship.

## "People Are Laughing At Us"

## Plot Against The West Uncovered

CAIRO - On the edge of the vast Egyptian capital lies a Syrian community. Women tie their headscarves in a Syrian way. They buy Syrian spices and trinkets from merchants whose shops are now tables on the streets. There is a constant murmur of stories about the residents fleeing their homeland in the past year.

The Syrian has heard this a dozen times already that day. He does not even respond. Rather, he points to a sign in front of the mosque behind him. It says that the mosque "has nothing to do with the marriage of Egyptian men to Syrian sisters. That's why there shouldn't be any questions regarding this issue in any of the offices of the organization. May Allah punish those responsible for spreading these rumors."

The painter does not go away. "Maybe there are Syrian women around the corner?" he asks.

The Syrian, who asks that he be identified only as Khalid, just shakes his head.

## Situation Is Changing Standards

## "We Want To Have A Future"

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Government scientists have discovered a puzzling new illness that is like cancer. They found it in a man who was 41 years old. They believe the man became ill through a common stomach bug.

## Scientists Were Very Surprised

While tapeworms are very common, it is unclear how common this type of tapeworm cancer illness is in humans. Some experts believe there may be other cases.

## Pro-Russian Leader

Almost half the students attending public schools are nonwhite. Meanwhile, fewer than 1 in 5 of their teachers is nonwhite.

New research is calling attention to this. Researchers call it a "diversity gap" at U.S. elementary schools, middle schools and high schools. A group called the National Education Association (NEA) that studies education organized the studies. They want more to be done to help teachers better mirror the students in their classrooms.

Students are a different story. In 1993, three out of 10 public school students were minorities. In 2003, minorities made up four out of 10 public school students.

The study's most recent figures show that number is now at about half.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said most public school students in the United States this fall are expected to be nonwhite. It would be the first time that ever happened.

Hispanics have passed blacks as the largest minority group of teachers. There are also more Hispanic students than African-Americans in the public school system. Hispanics are the largest minority group in the country and the fastest-growing.

Jan Alderson is a high school science teacher in Kansas. She saw the changes at her school.

The school has very few minority teachers, she said. But almost half of the students are minorities. "It's a beautiful blending, it's just teachers who don't have that cultural background."

WASHINGTON — One man trained soldiers to use Stinger missiles to shoot down enemy jets and helicopters.

They are part of an effort to turn thousands of veterans into teachers. The idea is that their leadership skills and life experiences could be valuable in the classroom.

People in the program who agree to work in schools that primarily serve low-income, high-needs students can get a $10,000 bonus.

Kajencki spent more than seven years in the Army. He trained soldiers to use missiles to shoot down enemy aircraft. He also was on the staff of a commanding general in Bosnia.

Technology is increasingly becoming something you can wear. There are music players that match the tunes to your heart beat. Some sweaters can change color depending on how you feel.

There are even fitness bracelets and necklaces to track your calorie burning.

Chaotic Moon Studios in Austin, Texas, is a mobile software company that is trying to come up with new "wearable tech." It's working on a product to compete with Google's upcoming eyewear that can log onto the Internet. It is also designing other wearable projects for several other customers.

## The Next Big Thing?

Gaming will also be affected. Look at products like the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset that enables 3-D gaming. Virtual reality technology makes you feel like you are in the middle of an artificial world.

Robin Arnott created a program for the Rift. He showed it off at a recent conference. Users strap on the headset. Then the program uses their vocal tones to display a series of tunnelling images, creating fantastical visual effects.

Brian Tunick follows retail for banking firm JPMorgan. He said lower-priced chains made significant gains from 2007 to 2013. So did "fast-fashion" retailers like Forever 21, H&amp;M, Uniqlo and Zara. They did it party by selling inexpensive clothes. They also change the clothes they sell frequently.

## Keeping An Eye On Store Closings

![](//newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/20130829_TEENJOBS.jpg) WASHINGTON — The number of working teens in the United States has stayed stuck around record lows for the fourth summer in a row. Experts say this could mean young people will face a future of fewer opportunities and lower pay.

The weak teen job market comes even as the overall jobs picture is getting better. The unemployment rate has steadily dropped. Businesses have been adding hundreds of thousands of jobs. So there was hope that this would be the summer when teen employment improved.

## Youth See Much Less Opportunity

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20141211_TEENAGERS_CRIME.png" />When teenagers are given jobs they may do fewer violent crimes, according to a recent study.

During the study, teens were selected to join a jobs program for eight weeks. The youths who were offered jobs were arrested for violent crimes less often than other teenagers.

There were 1,634 kids who applied to take part in the study. Of those, 730 teenagers were picked. The study compared the number of arrests by the teens who were picked to be in the study with the ones who were not.

Moshe plans to go back and finish his master's degree. Later, he wants to start his own computer company.

On a sunny afternoon, the words pour out of 19-year-old Celestelle Webster and 18-year-old Christelle Roach. The feelings they express are both fierce and startling.

The two are in a small auditorium at the Miami Beach Regional Library. Facing each other onstage, they speak the words they wrote together.

Unable to see a future for himself, the 18-year-old got involved in drugs and other crimes.

"I always thought it would be much better to be dead than in jail," Henderson said.

Henderson's choices should not come as a surprise, a new University of Texas at Dallas study shows. Researchers found that teens who believe they will die young are more likely to break the law. And their crimes tend to be more serious.

## A Question Of Time

For a long time, Henderson felt he had no choice. He didn't know any adults who went to college and many of the adults he did know sold drugs, he said. Earlier this year, Henderson himself was arrested for selling marijuana.

"I basically had no visible hope," he said. "I thought to myself, this is the lifestyle that everybody before me shows. This is the lifestyle that everyone around me is doing and this is the lifestyle I have to choose."

Brookfield (Wis.) Central High School student Chloe Olier started driving earlier this summer. When she did, her parents Dany and Virginie installed a DriveCam. The monitoring device records video whenever she makes driving mistakes.

She wasn't pleased. It emails mistakes to her parents, who review the footage online with her.

Chloe now says she'd tell her friends about it because it has made her a better driver. The family got the machine for free from auto insurer American Family Insurance. It recorded her 23 times the first week. Now, she only makes infrequent mistakes.

"It's nice because it tells me what I'm doing wrong so I don't do it anymore," she said. Chloe says she only notices the camera when it is recording, so she drives well to not notice it.

## Reduced Risky Driving

Scientists wanted to take a closer look at teen exercise habits. Scientists chose a large group of students from Seattle, Washington and Baltimore, Maryland. They were between the ages of 12 and 16. The scientists gave fitness trackers to the teens. The trackers are like watches or bracelets and can be worn on the wrist. The trackers recorded where they went using a GPS. They also showed how much exercise they were getting. The information was recorded every 30 seconds. Teens kept the trackers for about a week.

The trackers showed that students spent most of their awake time at school. Scientists confirmed that the students spent about 7 hours of their day at school. They also spent around five hours at home. Students were outside near home or school about three hours a day.

Cunningham could go back home and pick up her inhaler, but she would be late for the concert. She could pay more than $100 to see a doctor and get her medicine on the way. She could also go without it and hope there would be emergency equipment at the festival if she had an asthma attack. That did not seem like a very good idea, she said.

## A Flood Of Money

DUNHUANG, China — Deep in China's Gobi desert 1,700 years ago, Buddhist monks carved small caves into the sides of cliffs. The caves were beautifully painted to illustrate Buddhist stories and used to store important religious documents.

Today the caves are facing a new danger: tourists.

On Wednesday, Mexican scientists announced a major discovery. Underneath the ancient city of Teotihuacan, three buried chambers have been found at the end of a tunnel.

WASHINGTON — A terrorism group has discovered a disturbing new way to talk to its followers and get new ones.

DETROIT, Mich. — Tesla Motors is trying to build a car that drives itself. Now it has just taken a big step forward. It has figured out a way to make cars change lanes by themselves.

Automobiles that drive themselves are run by autopilot systems. Car computers give directions to the wheels and engine. Such directions let the car drive or pilot itself. The way the computer and the car's parts work together is called a system.

Tesla Motors already claims to have the electric car that can go the longest between charges. Now it also says it has the safest car on the road.

The electric car company said that "the Model S set a new record" during  government safety testing. People inside the car were the least likely to be hurt during a crash.

The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) didn't return calls to say whether Tesla was correct. But the Model S did win a five-star safety rating from the federal agency. Only vehicles that do the best on the crash tests get that rating.

Their idea is to find other sources of protein. This could include more vegetables, fewer animals, and possibly eating insects.

Texas students will begin using new schoolbooks this fall.

## People Worry About What Kids Are Learning

Rod Paige, who was in charge of the U.S. Department of Education, was among those who criticized the Texas board.

The history of slavery and civil rights are important parts of American history, Paige said. They have made America what it is today. "We may not like our history, but it's history," Paige said.

Historians agree that states' rights played a part in the Civil War. However, states' rights and slavery were basically the same thing, they say. The right that states in the South were seeking to protect, after all, was the right to buy and sell people.

Last week, Roni Dean-Burren received a text from her 15-year-old son.

Edward Countryman is a history professor at Southern Methodist University in Texas. He said it harms students when textbooks do not talk much about race and slavery.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, Calif., father of four. At the time, he had just learned a grim fact: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving the year before.

Irving decided he had to do something. In 2009 he began work on a smartphone app to help stop texting while behind the wheel. That app is called Text Kills. It has since grown into a nonprofit company.









Thailand's military took over the government on May 22 and cut back freedoms, including the right to protest. The military said it was necessary to restore order after months of protests.

## Using Symbols Against Military Rule

NEW YORK  — What do you get when you mix Thanksgiving with Hanukkah? Thanksgivukkah!

This year U.S. Thanksgiving is happening at the same time as Hanukkah. The rare event has created huge excitement.

The last time it happened was 1888, or at least the last time since Thanksgiving was declared a holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. By one calculation, the next time may be 79,043 years from now.

There's money to be made in Thanksgivukkah. A 9-year-old New York boy created the "menurkey." It's a menorah in the shape of a turkey. A menorah holds candles that are lit during Hanukkah. He's already trademarked the name. That means he owns the rights to use it. He's raised more than $48,000 on Kickstarter, a website where people can give money to projects they like.

Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's first female prime minister, died on April 8. She was 87.

## A Famous Photo

Gonpo spent her childhood dressed in fancy robes living in a castle in Tibet, an area near the Himalaya Mountains in Asia.

Forget climbing Mount Everest. For most humans, just surviving _anywhere_ high in the Tibetan mountains would be challenge enough. Tibetan people, however, have thrived up there for thousands of years.

JINTANG, China — Liu Xiangqing has taken care of cows all his life. And he had never seen them so scared.

Normally, at 6 a.m., they would be grazing in the dawn light. But one morning last June, they were scattered through the pine scrub, anxiously pacing. Liu took a quick head count and realized one was missing, a 2-year-old bull.

Siberian tigers weigh as much as 675 pounds, but they are hard to spot. They slink into the forest when humans approach. Villagers learn that a tiger has been on the prowl when they spot paw prints the size of melons. Or they discover that livestock are missing or mauled.

Four cows were killed in five days in May in another village near the border. One of the largest of Liu's cattle lost his tail to a tiger. The 1,300-pound bull stayed alive by fighting back.

Efforts to restore forests in China and Russia is what helped, he said. Russia began protecting the tiger in the 1940s. It has the largest population of Siberian tigers, between 400 and 900, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

But in recent years, China has caught up. It might even be moving ahead in creating areas for the tigers to live in, Li said.

"Russia has fewer people than China, so it is a better place for tigers. But they are doing a lot of logging and burning off of agriculture fields after harvest," he said. "The tigers don't like that."  Li, a native of Hunchun, the largest city in the region, added: "It is not hard for a tiger to jump over the barbed-wire fences at the border and come to China."

Some Chinese people still buy body parts of tigers that have been gotten in ways that are not legal. They are poached in India or killed in farms. But wild tigers have not been hunted in China since the 1950s. In fact, the hunting all animals except rats is banned in China.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Time_Person_Of_The_Ye_Edit.jpg" />NEW YORK — Time magazine selected Pope Francis as its Person of the Year on Wednesday. The newsmagazine said the Roman Catholic Church's new leader has really changed how people see the church in just a short time.

The magazine has been naming a Person of the Year each year since 1927.

Hawking may be wrong. New experiments say time travel could be possible — at least in the world of math. Proving that time travel is possible would change classical physics and allow for super-fast types of computers that use quantum physics, also called quantum mechanics.

## CTC: Closed Timelike Curve

It is not certain the particle will be shot out. It is only one probability, or chance. Deutsch thinks that tiny quantum particles are stable and fixed. If true, any particle entering one end of a CTC must come out the other end exactly the same. Imagine a particle shot out by the machine with a probability of one half. It would enter the CTC and come out the other end to flip the switch with a probability of one half.

RICHMOND, Va. — You have to be at least 18 to buy cigarettes in the U.S. However, when it comes to working in fields of tobacco, the main ingredient in cigarettes, it seems age doesn't matter.

An advance warning for a tornado means minutes, not hours. People in Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20 got 16 minutes.

In Newcastle it was only five minutes. That was the town nearest to where the tornado first formed. The mile-wide twister killed 24 people.

Tornadoes used to strike without any warning at all.  Weather forecasters have worked since the 1970s to get the average warning time to 13 minutes. They use weather balloons, radar and people watching from the ground.

Now they want to give people hours of warning – not just minutes. To do this, they want to send aircraft with no pilots right into a developing storm. Those unmanned aircraft are also called [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone). Pulling that off would require more than the right technology. The government would need to be more flexible about rules that block most unmanned flights.

But right now it is illegal to operate unmanned aircraft in U.S. airspace.

Some groups can ask for a special certificate to fly the aircraft. But then the government requires notice of 48 hours before the aircraft actually goes up. The government also says that the pilot must keep the aircraft in his or her sight at all times. This is impossible when it comes to tornadoes that form within hours and are hidden by rain.

Researchers say they are frustrated at how long it takes to change the rules.

Now he spends all his time trying to prevent such a disaster.

Erwin runs an architecture company in Springfield, Missouri.  It designs and builds tornado safe rooms in schools. The safe rooms are structures with the strongest possible walls and ceilings.  They are built to stand up to winds stronger than those from Monday's tornado near Oklahoma City. That twister destroyed two schools.

## Shelters For Schools And Civic Centers

Their correct predictions were combined with television and radio warnings, text-message alerts and storm sirens. They almost certainly saved lives. The storms howled through 12 states. They flattened entire neighborhoods within minutes. But only eight people died.

By Monday, another, more ordinary reason for the low death count came out. In the hardest-hit town, most families were in church.

"I don't think we had one church damaged," said Gary Manier, mayor of Washington, Ill. His community of 16,000 lies about 140 miles southwest of Chicago.

On Monday, he was surveying the damage on crutches. He suffered a leg injury when the wind knocked his home off its base.

That's when information from weather stations, weather balloons and satellites came together. It suggested there was more than enough moisture in the air. Moisture is fuel for storms.

This has been a mild year for twisters in the U.S. The number of twisters is running at or near record lows.

So far this year, there have been 886 early reports of tornadoes. There are about 1,400 early reports usually sent to the weather service by mid-November.

## At A Secret Location

WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, a controversial report came out about the CIA. Some lawmakers put out an extremely critical report about how American spies questioned enemies.

President George W. Bush approved the program in 2002 but didn't learn about the details until 2006. At that time Bush said he was uncomfortable with one of the images of a prisoner who was being tortured.

The suspect was held in a secret building in Thailand. The spies thought he had information on another terror attack. He was left isolated for 47 days without questioning, the report says. Later, he was tortured many times. He later suffered mental problems.

Now the report has been splashed across TV screens, newspapers and websites. The report's spread will put American lives at risk. It gives extremists one more reason to attack the U.S.

Back in 1950, Eiji Toyoda visited a Ford plant to learn how Americans made cars. The visit by a member of Japan's most important manufacturing family changed the way Toyota Motor Corp. made cars. And that in turn ended up altering the global auto industry.

Toyoda died Tuesday at the age of 100. He is credited with developing the car company's manufacturing processes. In addition, he helped spearhead Toyota's push into the U.S. auto market.

"Clearly Eiji was the person who laid the groundwork for what Toyota is today," said automotive researcher David Cole. "He was a real visionary and inspirational leader who understood what it would take to make Toyota a successful company."

Toyoda was a cousin of the Japanese automaker's founder, Kiichiro Toyoda. The family used the Toyota name for the business because they believed it sounded better.

Toyoda was born on Sept. 12, 1913, in Nagoya City. In 1936 he graduated from the University of Tokyo with a degree in mechanical engineering. That same year, he joined Toyoda Automatic Loom Works Ltd., a textile mill founded by his father and uncle. About a year later, he moved to the company's new automotive branch.

Having grown up at the family textile mill, Eiji Toyoda loved machines.

"From my childhood, machines and business were always there right in front of me," he said in a 1999 Time Magazine interview. "I probably developed an understanding of both."

Toyoda changed Toyota's manufacturing approach. The company began making only a small number of cars at a time. It ordered only enough parts as it needed for those cars.

This reduced the need to store supplies at the factory. It was the start of the system known as "kanban" or "just in time" delivery. This has become standard in the global auto industry.

The Japanese car company wants to become important in this new area. Toyota calls it "partner robots." Toyota has only 150 robotics engineers, who design robots. To compare, about 300,000 people work for the company around the world. Toyota is putting money into developing new robots.

Last month, Toyota announced it bought part of a company to develop robots. It spent $1 billion. Toyota is already working with Stanford University in California and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on robotics.

Akifumi Tamaoki is in charge of Toyota's partner robot division. He said that in the future people may not be able to drive their own cars or may need help. Toyota thinks many people could use a partner robot to help them.

## Business Important In Japan

Successful movies have helped companies sell huge numbers of toys. For example, the movie "Frozen," which came out in 2014, was an enormous success. "Frozen" tells the story of a princess with icy powers. Toys linked with the movie were very popular. In fact, "Frozen" was the top toy brand last year, NPD said.

Movie-based toys look like they will be popular again this year. The new "Star Wars" movie comes out on December 18. Hundreds of "Star Wars" toys, from puzzles to action figures, are already on sale. "Star Wars" might help toy companies have a big year in 2015.

Business expert Marty Brochstein says that one "Star Wars" toy is already selling out. The "Kylo Ren" Deluxe LightSaber is flying off shelves. It uses advanced technology to help kids imagine it is just like the light sabers used in the movies.

Mattel, the nation's largest toy company, is also hoping technology will help sales.

LOS ANGELES — The Pacific Crest Trail is very challenging for hikers. It runs up the entire length of California and all the way to Canada, for 2,650 rugged miles.

Sandy and Barney Mann live near the southern end of the trail. They open their five-bedroom San Diego home to as many as 60 hikers a night. They even pick them up from the airport and drive them to the trail's starting point an hour east.

Donna and Jeff Saufley live up the trail, in Agua Dulce. They provide a night's rest to more than 1,000 hikers a season. They even offer food and shelter to the hikers' dogs and horses.

Hank Magnuski lives east of San Francisco. He gives hot coffee and snacks to hikers coming off a particularly tough 300-mile stretch.

They are all part of a small network of people known as "trail angels."

## "A Very Exciting Moment"

NEW YORK — The college classroom is the proper place to seriously discuss potentially traumatic topics. Trigger warnings don't interfere with that process — in fact, they improve upon it.

Trigger warnings started on the Internet. Originally, they were a way to alert readers about content that might be traumatic.

A rape victim, for instance, might rightly prefer to have some warning before encountering a vivid description of sexual attack. Trigger warnings generally don't spark much hostility in online writing. Some writers use them, but most don't.

Earlier this year, though, college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes. Their demand provoked a huge, angry response.

Unlike most professors, though, I found the idea fascinating. As a history professor I discuss some very difficult material in class. I think it's important to give students a clear sense of their rights.

I came up with a trigger warning of my own. In my trigger warning I tell students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.

I let students know that I'm open to discussing their personal response to historical topics during class or during my office hours. I tell them that they're free to step outside briefly if they find any readings upsetting.

## Hunting Laws Are Often Ignored

Some people argue that hunting brings little money to villages.

For millions of years, the biggest dinosaurs on the planet stayed out of tropical areas. Now scientists think they know why.

These massive, long-necked plant eaters are called sauropodomorphs. More than 200 million years ago, they became common in the northern and southern parts of the world. Scientists have found proof that they first lived in places like Europe and Argentina. Sauropodomorphs include sauropods like Brontosaurus and Diplodocus.

Over time, this type of crime has become more and more common. It has allowed thieves to make off with millions of dollars in goods each year. They often steal food and drinks. And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal cargo.

A generation ago, thieves simply stole loaded trucks out of parking lots. But then the industry had started using tracking devices, high-tech locks and other protection. Now, thieves are changing how they do business, too.

Using the Internet, thieves can look at huge amounts of information about the trucking industry. Online databases allow them to take the names of real truckers. They can also look for the goods they want to steal. Using the Internet, they can get the right paperwork to pretend to be someone else.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Donald Trump is running for president. He wants everyone who came to the United States against the law to leave. There are about 11 million of them.

MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Donald Trump is a Republican candidate running for president. On Tuesday he defended his idea to block all Muslims from entering the United States. Other Republican candidates for president and political leaders do not agree with Trump's idea.

Turkeys are fitness nuts. They eat seeds, acorns, mushrooms and sometimes frog legs and have the strong muscles to get away fast if bothered. They can run at 20 miles per hour and fly at 55 mph.

If you heard that a turkey is so stupid it will look up at rain and drown, that's false. Turkeys have eyes like lasers and really good ears.

Hunters know if they move a muscle, a turkey will see it from a mile away. The birds' ability to know the direction and distance of sound in heavy woods is astounding, say scientists.

Some people say that you are what you eat. If that's true, then turkeys taste like nature. Wild turkeys have "a lot less fat" than store-bought ones, said Tom Hughes of the National Wild Turkey Federation.

If eagles are what they wolf down at landfills, then yuck.

The school denies it is trying to force the students. Guvener said the school told him there was no demand for any other electives except religious classes. He could not believe that not one of the 900 students had asked for math or English. After he spoke out, the school offered his daughter an astronomy class.

"It's not possible to control the youth of today," he said.
Pictures of the lost relatives were pinned onto the women's clothing. "The love of my life is gone," some sang, chanting the names of dead miners.

This is Turkey's worst mining accident.

Mining accidents are common in Turkey. Turkish mines have poor safety conditions. Erdogan promised that Tuesday's mining disaster would be investigated thoroughly.

The mine had been inspected five times since 2012. The most recent inspection was in March. No safety violations were detected then. But Erdogan's government recently decided against investigating a series of small accidents at the mines around Soma.
They scientists believed that when the beach changes in magnetism, turtles lay their eggs in different spots.

Welcome to the mysterious world of sea turtles. They spend much of their life facing fishing boats, oil spills, plastic trash and many other dangers.

Loggerhead, green and leatherback are three types of turtles that nest along the state's coast. Over the past five years, their numbers have generally gone up — but from year to year they have shot up and gone down.

Loggerhead turtles are the kings of Florida's coast. They are called loggerheads because their heads are huge. They have 3 1/2-foot shells. Female loggerheads laid eggs in 46,885 nests this year.

Scientists counted each of those nests at spots on 26 beaches.

Professor Ehrhart noted that in 1978, restaurants had to get green-turtle steaks out of their freezers and green-turtle soup stopped showing up on menus. "Most people stopped killing them, and guess what, they came back," he said.

Laws protecting turtles and their nests have caused communities to become better about dimming the lights along the seashore. Green turtles especially are scared by bright lights.

Mansfield said green turtles may have once lived in large numbers on Florida shores. They are now coming back.

"I don't think anybody knows the reason for this," he said. "Between the time they hit the water as hatchlings and the time they come back 800- or 900-pound adults, there are hardly any records of them appearing anywhere."

The Internet can be full of hateful comments and put-downs. To spread positive thoughts instead, a little blue robot is sharing happiness and compliments. 

On Twitter, "@TheNiceBot" is a cheerful online robot that sends happy, kind tweets. A computer chooses compliments to tweet. Then the NiceBot tweets compliments to Twitter users.

The $2 bill does not get a lot of respect. It is more likely to be found tucked inside a dresser drawer or wallet than a cash register.

Now, it's about to get its time in the spotlight. John Bennardo of Florida is making a nonfiction film that will tell the story of the two and its "magic."

## Twos Are Special To Some

Many people save $2 bills. Others make a point to spend them. They want to see what happens next.

Bennardo owns Immagine Productions and is a Lynn University professor of film and television editing. He has always saved the bills. By last summer he had 11 of them in a desk drawer. They were never to be spent. It got him thinking: What is it about the two?

Amy Byer Shainman also lives in Florida and cares a lot about the bill. She joined on as a producer of the film. She said she has kept a two her high school crush gave her for more than 25 years. She did not know why.

Beyond that, he has traveled to several states. Among them were Texas, New York, Michigan and Oregon. He has interviewed about 50 people in all.

One is Heather McCabe of New York City. She requests $2 bills from her bank and spends them at local businesses in hopes of seeing it catch on. She writes about how people react on her blog, Two Buckaroo.

McCabe, 39, started spending twos about 15 years ago. She liked the added conversation with people behind the counter.

Some pro-gun Texans have recently held rallies. They have taken place at fast-food restaurants and home-improvement stores. But officials with the National Rifle Association say the rallies are "downright weird." They say the protests are "certainly not a practical way to go normally about your business while being prepared to defend yourself."

The group praises Texas for a strong "gun culture." But leaders of the group scolded "a small number who have recently crossed the line from enthusiasm to downright foolishness."

A group called Open Carry Tarrant County also made national headlines. Their actions caused confusion at a Jack in the Box in Fort Worth. Somebody called 911. The caller was concerned about a group of men walking around with long-barreled guns.

Another demonstration took place at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Dallas. It gained attention when managers asked customers not to bring guns into the restaurants. That is, "unless they are authorized law enforcement."

Some leaders in the open-carry movement recently sent out a letter. It called on supporters to stop trying to carry long guns into Texas businesses.

"We ask that members take a step back," the letter said. "Help us get open carry passed for everyone." It was signed by four different groups.

Parents will be sending their kids to and from school and other activities in a new way this fall. More and more parents are looking to companies like Uber, Lyft and others to drive their kids. The companies offer ride-hailing services. The services let people ask for a ride using an app on a smartphone.

There is a lot of demand for the rides. In fact, several new companies have been started just to drive children.

Still, it is not clear if they will take the place of kids calling parents for a ride.

Katie Dally works at Lyft. She said the company does not let kids travel alone in Lyft cars. Uber spokeswoman Brooke Anderson declined to talk about it.

Uber and Lyft rule the ride-hailing business. The business has grown fast over the past few years.

Uber is the biggest of the companies. It was started in 2009 in San Francisco, California. It is now worth more than $50 billion, The Wall Street Journal said.

The artwork was a sepia-toned collage. It was also a self-portrait of sorts. It showed the faces of the students who created it staring at the interior of Ackerman Union, their faces and hair made up of small images of famous African-Americans.

After graduating in 1974, Singleton took a job at UCLA. Over the years she occasionally stopped at the mural to look at the artwork and think about her classmates.

Then one day in 1992, she saw the mural was gone. A wall stood in its place.

"I was devastated," said Singleton. In 1970, when Singleton helped create the mural, she was a 37-year-old mother.

KIEV, Ukraine — The eastern European country of Ukraine is in a crisis.

## Can't Afford Bullets

KIEV, Ukraine — The 3-month-old uprising against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich turned deadly on Tuesday. First, anti-government protesters set fire to the ruling party's headquarters. Then, police stormed the protesters' tent camp in what government officials called "an anti-terror operation."

At least nine people were killed: two police officers, an official of the ruling party, and six protesters. Opposition leader Oleksandra Kuzhel said the death toll had grown to 15 after police stormed the tent camp with stun grenades and water cannons, while other reports put the number of dead as high as 19.

Ukraine is an unstable country with two fighting sides. Ukraine used to be a part of the Soviet Union, a large country that included Russia.

The fighting in Slovyansk stopped for a while on Sunday. Meanwhile, other cities in Ukraine saw fighting.

## Trying Not To Get Caught

Last week, the United Way began the program, called Club Connect Adopt-a-School, in schools across the country. It is the first time the organization has adopted poor schools in so many states.

## Designed For The Poorest Schools

The goal of The Pie Patch is to provide low-cost, healthy options to people who live nearby.

In Philadelphia, about 120 students belong to SquashSmarts. They are in the fifth through 12th grades. The program provides kids with all their uniforms, equipment, snacks and tutoring.

SquashSmarts tracks players' heart health and grades. It also keeps track of whether students go to college. The school district has a high dropout rate. But everyone who stayed in the club for seven years has graduated and goes to college, said Stephen Gregg, who runs SquashSmarts.

Hiring Miller brings the program full circle, he said. Miller is now 23. She is finishing her degree from Penn State. She is the program's new squash director.

When a SquashSmarts student becomes one of the heads of the program that "is change in a community," Gregg said.
SEATTLE — Curtis Morrison needed help when he moved to Seattle from and Indian reservation in Montana.

The Chief Seattle Club helped him adjust to living in the big city. He says the club helped him find a home and get medicine.

"Other places didn't know what I was talking about, and nothing would happen," said Morrison, who's 45. "It was hard, but I have opportunities and a new beginning."

Seattle has one of the highest populations of city Indians in the country. Organizers say the club helps a group that's often overlooked.

About 2.8 million Native Americans live in and around cities, according to the government. Seven out of 10 Native Americans live in cities.

The lawyers come from different backgrounds but have one thing in common:  They have knowledge of Indian law and the Indian experience.

The club started offering legal help in 2006. It tries to help Natives, who usually keep to themselves and don't trust others.

The Indians living in the city also don't get the same support as they do on the reservation. Dunlap never knew his family was poor growing up on the Fond du Lac Reservation in Minnesota.

"When you come to the cities or urban areas, they're not there," said Stearns.

The legal system often hasn't worked in the past for people who come to the clinic. That makes it hard for them to understand the system and make it work, said Sean Cecil. He is a Seattle lawyer who volunteers for the clinic.

BEIJING, China — The presidents of the United States and China announced a new plan to fight climate change on Wednesday. The two leaders laid out an ambitious effort to cut pollution in their own countries.

President Barack Obama said the U.S. must do more to prevent global warming. Under the new plan, the country will aim to cut pollution that causes climate change by at least 26 percent by 2025. The new target doubles the previous goal of cutting pollution.

## Preventing Global Warming

## Investing In Alternative Energy

China is now by far the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases. Its severe air pollution has upset people in China and embarrassed the country internationally, said Wang Yiwei of Beijing's People's University. He said Chinese leaders can no longer ignore the problem.

China is investing heavily in alternative energy. At the same time, China's government wants to shift the country away from heavily polluting industries. It hopes to encourage the country to grow more slowly and develop less polluting businesses.

ACACIAS, Colombia — A bull the size of small car barrels down the muddy track, chased by a man on horseback. The man, wearing a crash helmet and an American-flag shirt, slips in behind the galloping beast. He snatches its tail, wraps it around his fist and leans far off his saddle. The bull tumbles and rolls, before bouncing up and lumbering down the track.

Welcome to the world of coleo, a high-speed, high-risk sport that's hard on man, bull and audience alike.

In this part of South America, coleo is something people grow up doing. It is learned by farmhands who have to chase down runaway cattle.

But these llanos, or plains, are also the worldwide center of coleo. Competitors are drawn here from around Latin America and beyond. During a recent event, there were Venezuelans in their tricolor shirts and Mexicans with their chaps and wagon-wheel sombreros. And then there were the men from South Florida, who were wearing cowboy hats and boots.

"Anytime you're talking about taking an animal, grabbing its tail and flipping it," it's very dangerous for the animal, she said. "I don't think there's a way to change it to make it better."

Best Buy Co. Inc. launched a trade-in program in 2009 for things like cellphones, video games and the computers to play them on. It's gotten more popular every year, and now Best Buy is accepting more than 11,000 different devices. The number of devices traded in "has doubled every year since 2009," Jeff Shelman, a Best Buy spokesman, wrote in an email.

The numbers keep growing as well at Pawn America's 29 Midwest stores. In 2013, sales of used cellphones were up by more than one-tenth. Tablets sales increased by two times.

People have a lot of choices to unload their old, but not too old, technology. Pawnshops have been a popular go-to for many years. Retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Radio Shack have gotten into the act as well. They offer store credit in exchange for used electronics online or in stores.

Many websites, such as Gazelle.com, BuyBackWorld.com and Nextworth.com, will pay money to people who mail in used devices.  As a result, companies such as Usell.com have popped up to list bids from several resellers.

SYRACUSE, Utah — For many years, farmer Neal Briggs has looked east to the mighty Wasatch mountain range.

"This is one of those years farmers will tell their grandkids about," said Utah water expert Randall Julander. "About just how dry it was and how bad it was."

Still, many safety officials say higher speed limits will lead to more deaths on the roads. High speeds play a part in 1 out of every 3 highway deaths.

The 1888 painting "Sunset at Montmajour" was sent to experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. They looked at Vincent Van Gogh's letters, the chemical makeup of the paint, and X-rays of the painting.

Museum director Axel Rueger called the discovery a "once-in-a-lifetime experience."

"Sunset at Montmajour" is roughly 37-by-29-inches. It shows a dry landscape of twisting oak trees, bushes and sky. It was done during the period when Van Gogh was using the thick "impasto" brush strokes. They became typical of his work in the final years of his short life.

Three researchers published an article in The Burlington Magazine. They said the painting was recorded as number 180 in Theo's collection. It was given the title "Sun Setting at Arles." It was sold to Maurice Fabre in 1901. Fabre was a Frenchman who bought and sold art.

Fabre never wrote down that he sold the work. Then the painting disappeared from history. It only reappeared in 1970. It was in the estate of Norwegian industrialist Christian Nicolai Mustad.

Mustad's family said he purchased it in 1908 as a young man. It was one of his first attempts at art collecting. He was soon told it was a fake. Embarrassed, Mustad banished it to the attic.

After Mustad's death in 1970, the famous art seller Daniel Wildenstein took another look at it. He said he thought the painting was a fake Van Gogh. It was sold to a collector. The museum would not say who bought it or whether it had been resold since then.

"That may be a painful admission," The Burlington Magazine article said. The same museum now says it is a Van Gogh. But it is understandable. The experts had no information about what was shown in the painting.

Among other reasons experts had their doubts back then: The painting was unsigned. Parts of the foreground were not "as well-observed as usual," the researchers said. And part of the right side of the painting used a different style of brush strokes.

But when the museum took a fresh look at the work in 2011, its experts had the advantage of a new collection of all Van Gogh's letters. They were able to identify the exact location "Sunset" shows for the first time. It is Montmajour hill, near Arles. The ruins of Montmajour Abbey can be seen in the background.

Van Gogh mentioned the painting in two other letters that same summer.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. — The Weiser Family Farms' stand had potatoes, onions and garlic — and not much else.

That, in a nutshell, is the situation in California. The state does $30 billion a year in its fruit and vegetable business. California grows more than half of the fresh produce in America.

On the other hand, summer will come early. The Weisers planted melons three weeks earlier. They should ripen in a couple of weeks, instead of when they usually do in mid-June.







"It is a government that represses the people," she said. It "does not allow freedom of expression," and it is responsible for "food shortages and violence." That's why they were urging people around the world to help get rid of the government in Venezuela, Archer said.

"I was born and raised in Venezuela," said 44-year-old Blanca Aleman, who now lives in Weston, Fla. "I love my country and I want my kids to know the country I knew, not what it is now."

Aleman's 18-year-old son Marc Burnard was able to accompany her. Her parents and brother, however, are still back in Venezuela.

In Venezuela, protests over the past two weeks have led to violence and deaths. Both the government's enemies and supporters have been protesting in the streets. At least 10 deaths have been reported since Feb. 12.

The protests are being called the biggest since Maduro replaced President Hugo Chavez. Venezuela's former president died March 5 last year.

"My brother is a Type I diabetic," she said. "He can't find insulin."

Most at the rally were Venezuelan. But people from other Latin American countries had shown up as well.

Cuban-born Berardo Barrero said he was there because he can relate to the situation in Venezuela.

"You have to stand up for the right to liberty in all countries," said Barrero, 57.

Another Cuban at the Doral rally was Ramon Saul Sanchez.

"I'm here to lend solidarity to the Venezuelan people," Sanchez said.

"It's great," said Venezuelan Andrea Taglia Ferro, 29, speaking of the support from other Latin Americans. "Our situation is touching them."

She added that the Internet has helped raise awareness.

"The country is sinking," said Enrique Chacon, a native of San Cristobal, Venezuela. The 45-year-old attended the rally with his brother, sister-in-law, nephew and niece.

CARACAS, Venezuela — Helena Siso spent hours in line to buy groceries. She did not know why the stores were short on groceries and she did not care. She just wanted the government to do something about it.

Officials across the nation placed wreaths on monuments to honor those who served in wars over the nation's history. They also pushed for more jobs for veterans.

In New York, Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody led the parade.  Dunwoody retired last year after 37 years in the Army. There were 21.2 million military veterans as of 2012 in the United States. Of that group 1.6 million are women, according to the government.

## Changing Face Of Military

The main part of the nation's observance was the traditional televised laying of a wreath by the president at the Tomb of the Unknowns. It honors soldiers who died without anyone knowing who they were. The tomb is located in Arlington National Cemetery. The usual 21-gun salute was fired. The president was joined by representatives of all of the services: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.

Obama honored one of the nation's oldest veterans, Richard Overton, 107. "This is the life of one American veteran, living proud and strong in the land he helped keep free," Obama said.

Earlier, the president hosted a breakfast at the White House. Veterans and their families were invited.

## Holiday Began In 1919

WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, two dozen veterans who fought in World War II, Korea and Vietnam received the Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama. The White House award ceremony was serious and tearful. The honors came after many years of reviewing thousands of war records.

"I'm busting with pride," said Charles Baldonado, 77. His brother Joe R. Baldonado was among those honored. Joe Baldonado, who was from Los Angeles, died at age 20 in Korea. He used a machine gun to drive back enemy troops as grenades exploded around him. Eventually, he was killed by one.

LOS ANGELES — Students at Cal State are breeding fruit flies. Others are monitoring the heart rate of people on a treadmill.

These are common lab experiments. But one thing is different. The experiments are being conducted online.

Across the country, students are increasingly doing online simulations. In some cases, it replaces hands-on traditional lab work.

Doctors at the University of Minnesota are using simulators to improve their surgical skills. They use these 3-D tools to practice for difficult cases, such as brain tumors. And they are working with medical device companies. The goal is to develop new software to train the next generation of doctors.

## A Practice Run Before Surgery

Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning surgery.

Sweet dropped by the school's technology lab and they built one. But early simulators were crude compared to the ones being developed now.

Maryland tests eyesight in first grade and ninth grade. This leaves a lot of time in between when problems could be missed.

Julie Gray has been teaching at Charles Carroll Barrister for 16 years. Eye problems are the last thing she looks for when a student has trouble reading, she said.

HOPE MILLS, N.C. — Alberta Currie's great-grandparents were slaves. She was born in a farmhouse in the middle of tobacco and cotton fields. Her mother gave birth to her 78 years ago at home with just a midwife's help.

No birth certificate was recorded. There was just a handwritten birth announcement entered into the Currie family Bible.

This is causing problems today. It may force Currie to miss her first election since 1956. A new North Carolina law says people need to get an ID with a picture from the state to be allowed to vote. People will need the ID for the 2016 election.

Voters do not have to pay for the ID. But they have to show documents that many voters do not have. They need an original or certified birth certificate. They also need an original Social Security card.

Currie has spent three years trying to persuade officials to give her a birth certificate. Now, because of the new law, she must locate several other documents. For someone her age, it's a challenge.

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday over a new state voting law. The law says people have to show a state ID with a photo before they can vote. It also limits early voting.

## Law Makes It Harder For Some To Vote

Earlier this month, two big companies announced their new VR technology. Oculus released information about the VR headset it is working on. Sony also provided more details about its own VR headset.

VR headsets can sometimes make their users sick. McCauley said this feeling occurs because there is a difference between what your eyes see and what your ears feel and hear. Our eyes and ears work together to keep our body balanced. If one of them experiences something different than the other, it can make us feel ill. When done correctly, VR can produce a wonderful sense of speed and power. When it is not done correctly, VR can make a user ill.

## Dishonesty Shows In 11 Million Cars

AUSTIN, Texas — Wal-Mart managers in Texas have a new job. The managers have to ask customers if they have a permit to carry a handgun.

## Some Businesses Trying To Find A Middle Ground

Some companies are trying to be in the middle. They publicly oppose guns in their Texas stores. Yet, they do not want to post signs that firearms are not allowed. The coffee giant Starbucks Corp. and Target Corp. both do this.

Gun-control activists are against this kind of balancing act. The Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has taken a stand against it.

"The strongest statement businesses can make for their customers' safety and care is getting that sign up," said Alexandra Chasse. She is with the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action.

Wal-Mart says it is asking customers to show a gun permit only in Texas stores that sell alcohol. Wal-Mart itself sells rifles and shotguns.

Bravo de Rueda said she was surprised. Still, she showed the worker her permit and began to shop.

This year, 10 walrus were caught, said Diomede hunter Robert Soolook. He said there are still walrus in the area, but they are moving out sooner. Soolook said hunters will need to change their ways to keep up with the changes.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Pacific walrus can't find sea ice for resting in Arctic waters. As a result, they are coming on to a beach in northwest Alaska in record numbers.

The enormous gathering was spotted by researchers surveying the area by air. Every year, researchers do a survey of Arctic sea animals.

Pacific walrus spend winters in the Bering Sea. Females give birth on sea ice. They also use ice as a diving platform to reach clams, snails and worms on the shallow continental shelf.

Unlike seals, walrus cannot keep swimming and swimming. They must rest. Walrus use their tusks to pull themselves onto ice or rocks.

Temperatures are getting warmer in the summer. Sea ice is melting. As a result, the edge of the sea ice has moved north. Females and their young ride the edge of the sea ice into the Chukchi Sea, the body of water north of the Bering Strait.

Sea ice has retreated north beyond shallow continental shelf waters in the past few years. It has moved into Arctic Ocean water. There, the water is more than 2 miles deep. Walrus cannot dive to the bottom to get food.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It started more than 60 years ago. Construction crews were beginning to build on sections of a Kansas City meadow located near the Blue River. Soon, a man began showing up with a metal detector.

Adams found belt buckles, guns, bullets and unexploded shells. He even found a carved bullet that may have been used as a chess piece. Often he arrived after big rains, in case rushing water had revealed something previously hidden. Whenever new construction began, he asked permission to look around.

Visitors to the Battle of Westport Museum can see what Adams saved. About 75 objects are being shown. The area he took them from is known as the Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield.

Beginning in 1880, scientists started carefully measuring temperatures across Earth. Last year, 2014, was the warmest year they have seen.

### PRO: A pullout is the wrong move

WASHINGTON — Henry Kissinger used to be U.S. secretary of state and he won the Nobel Peace Prize. By all measures, he's a heavyweight in the world of international relations. At a recent gathering, he stood — peering commandingly over his signature thick, black-frame glasses — and remarked:  "Withdrawal is not victory."

Many Vietnam War protesters see America's withdrawal as a triumph. But, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. We can still debate the wisdom of going to war there. That our total abandonment of our allies left a bloody and shameful history is not in doubt.

Kissinger's comments weren't meant to bring up ancient history. He was complaining about history repeating itself. The prospects are now high that Afghanistan will fail … needlessly.

The plane comes from the 1970s. It has a seven-barreled gun the size of a small car. The gun is located in the plane's nose. The A-10 has a reputation for tearing apart tanks. It clears the way for troops on the ground with its huge bullets.

But military leaders have targeted the ugly looking plane for a few years. The Air Force prefers planes that fight well in the air and drop bombs guided by computers. It would rather spend its shrinking amount of money on new planes like those.

SEATTLE, Wash. — Farmers in Washington state are getting ready for a tough summer.

The storm dropped more than an inch of rain over much of Los Angeles County. There was even more rain in the local mountains.

## The Rainfall Is A Good Sign

People in the San Gabriel foothills were worried about keeping the mud away from houses.

More than 18,000 sandbags were distributed before the storm. Fifty thousand had already been given out earlier in the year.

Los Angeles County firefighters arrived Monday night to put sandbags around Ed Heinlein's home. Heinlein ran around his home Tuesday to support a wooden barrier with wire.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — There are many reasons Ron Morgan's 100 Gardens project could fail. But there are more reasons he's determined to make it work, one vegetable seedling at a time.

The idea behind the nonprofit came to Morgan, a trained architect, after a trip to Haiti. He traveled there with members of his church after the 2010 earthquake, expecting to design shelters for some of the 1.5 million people left homeless.

There's little farmable land available in Haiti. Other groups are also experimenting with aquaponics.

One night, Morgan was at a local grill, talking about how much he wanted to help. A man at the next table said: "You've got to meet George."

PLEASANTON, Calif. — Leon Jung knew he would need to do something unusual to save his dying grass.

## Come And Get It!

A new study polled Americans on how much water they think they use. It found they use twice the amount of water they think they do. They appear to be particularly clueless about how much H2O they flush down the toilet each day, the report found.

The report, published Monday, also found that Americans were only slightly aware of how much water goes into growing the food they eat.

The study's findings were based on an Internet survey of 1,020 people. The results come just as the country is in the middle of a national drought. An area from the Pacific Coast to portions of the Mississippi Valley faces a lack of water. California is struggling with the most severe conditions.

MADERA COUNTY, Calif. — Filiberta Sanchez and her toddler granddaughter strolled down a Parkwood sidewalk under the hot Central Valley sun. The sidewalk was lined with yellow weeds and dying grass.

State officials this year started tracking areas that could run out of water during California's drought. They made a list of water systems that could run dry within two months.

The one 27-foot-deep well that still works can't pump enough water for the resort.

The resort has asked for state help to dig wells as deep as 200 feet. Meanwhile, people are asked not to water outdoors, leaving the resort faded and brown.

But there are people who believe in dry farming. Many of them are small farmers and wine makers. They may not have a way to regularly water, or irrigate, their crops.  Or they believe that dry farming produces better-tasting fruits and vegetables.

"This year is a whole new level of crazy," said Ara Azhderian. He is with the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority. The group represents many farmers who probably won't get any water for farming this year.

Mostly, the complaints are about the water in the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.

## Water War

WASHINGTON — In May 1995, geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons designers. To his surprise, the former enemies were eager to work together. They warned of an unlikely but dangerous threat from space: asteroids that might someday be headed straight for Earth.

First Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, spoke up. He urged the others to consider building huge, new nuclear weapons to protect the planet. Then some top Russian weapons experts lent their support.

"It's so unfortunate that our society has come to this, that we feel that more militarizing will actually solve a problem. It has yet to do that," said Marlyn Tillman, who heads a group that opposes putting police in schools. "We're turning to a solution that really is the problem."

CHICAGO — A weather condition called a "polar vortex" was forecast to bring below-zero temperatures to much of the nation. It was expected to be colder than it has been in years.

WASHINGTON — Will wildfires keep getting bigger, more frequent and deadly? People who live in Western states are suffering another summer of destruction.

Across the United States, the six worst fire seasons since 1960 have happened in the past 13 years. Last year, 9.2 million acres went up in flames. The worst one was 2006, when 9.8 million acres burned.

The U.S. Forest Service says about 65 million acres of its land are at "high or very high risk of wildfires." State lawmakers are working out how to fight the fires with limited money. The government cannot control hot and dry weather. But states can tell their people where to live to put them at less risk from the wildfires.

## Put In Harm's Way

Scientists think they have found important evidence that can help them understand how early human beings evolved, or developed. The evidence is the remains, or fossil, of a whale. The whale likely took a wrong turn up an African river about 17 million years ago.

There is evidence that the uplift happened around a time when the local climate got drier. The drying changed a warm, damp forest into grasslands with more widely spaced trees. Scientists think that this kind of climate was better for mammals that could straighten their backs and walk longer distances on two feet. This eventually led to modern humans.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131205_BEACHEDWHALES.jpg" />FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — In the past two months, more than 90 whales have become stranded on Florida's beaches. This is almost three times as many as would normally be expected.

Scientists are learning a lot about the life of a dead blue whale from a pretty unusual source: a giant plug of earwax.

But unlike the other whales, this one stayed near the surface. Humpbacks come to the bay to feast on krill, a tiny crustacean. They dive down to feed on the krill. This one didn't.

## Whales And Crabs Clash

Crab fishermen drop traps to the sea floor. The traps are attached to buoys that float on the surface. Whales have been getting tangled in the lines that connect the traps and the buoys.

AKRON, Ohio — The six warriors' legs were tucked inside of their machines. On their hands, they placed a foam-like wrap. Then, they added gloves and metallic tape with the sticky side up. They were ready to do battle.

They were playing wheelchair rugby, a sport so fierce it was once called "murderball."

## Close Relative Saved From Extinction

Veterinarian Barbara Durrant works for the San Diego Zoo. She and other scientists have a new plan. They have reproductive cells from 12 northern white rhinos. Using the stored cells the scientists hope an embryo will grow in the lab. An embryo is a cluster of cells that grow into a baby. The plan is to use southern white rhino females as surrogate mothers. A surrogate carries a baby for another mother. The surrogate southern white rhinos would carry and deliver northern white rhino babies. The experiment is still in the testing stage. Durrant said it's only been done twice. Both times the cells failed to grow properly. 

The San Diego Zoo has set aside $2 million for the new plan. 

Governments and private groups have spent years of research and millions of dollars to help the species make a comeback. There were only 23 left in 1954, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The three cranes died in Kentucky and Louisiana. Since 2001, a total of 19 whooping cranes have been killed by humans. Conservationists only release an average of 13 cranes into the wild each year, according to Operation Migration.

The fire burned 257,000 acres of High Sierra wilderness in the Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park. It houses a group of roughly 200 great gray owls that cannot be found anywhere else.

Scientists actually thought the foxes were wiped out 90 years ago. They only found the foxes again in 2010. The foxes are now being considered for special protection.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Nineteen firefighters died Sunday while battling a fast-moving wildfire northwest of Phoenix, the most firefighters killed fighting a wildfire since 1933.

They were fighting the Yarnell Hill fire, an out-of-control blaze that had surrounded the community of Yarnell. The 649 people who lived there had been moved out by emergency officials. But most of the town was burned down. About 200 buildings were lost .

The firefighters belonged to the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew. The group was a specially trained unit. The fire department in nearby Prescott sponsored the crew. Residents expressed their sadness on social media once they heard about the deaths Sunday night.

Beijing's rival city was Almaty, Kazakhstan. The final vote was 44 to 40, which was surprisingly close.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is in charge of the Games. It saw Beijing as a safe choice. With more than 300 million people in northern China, Beijing also offered the chance to make a lot of money. The northern Chinese city hosted the Summer Olympics in 2008.

"We know China will deliver on its promises," IOC President Thomas Bach said of the selection.

Defenders of the wolves see it another way. They point out that there have been no recorded wolf attacks in New Mexico or Arizona. Fears of wolves attacking humans, they say, are exaggerated. They call the cages nothing more than a stunt.

In 1995, Canadian gray wolves were reintroduced into the northern Rockies. People got really angry.

Now that anger has flowed into the Southwest. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wants to extend protection for an estimated 75 Mexican wolves in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona.

IRONWOOD, Mich. — John Koski pulls back the old blanket to uncover two cows, or what's left of them. More than half of each is picked clean. The bones are almost polished white, with no traces of flesh. Some of the rib bones are snapped and show signs of being gnawed upon.

The dead cattle on Koski's farm are the latest victims in his war with wolves. The 68-year-old farmer lives in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. In the past three years, wolves have killed or injured 119 cows on his farm.

"I think this is the last year I'm going to keep cattle here because I'm losing so many," Koski said.

Over the last few years, Ironwood has seen the nearby wolf population grow,  said Scott Erickson who works for the city.

"There's a wolf problem in the area — I think everybody understands that," he said.

The wolf and his mystery mate would be the first known wolves to breed in the Oregon Cascades in 100 years. Wolf lovers also hope wolves could again live in California. The state has had no wolves for nearly a century.

"OR7 is over 250 miles from the nearest known wolf pack," said John Stephenson, a wolf biologist who has been monitoring the wolf. "It always seemed like a real long shot that he'd find a female wolf in that area. There aren't any.

OR7 trekked back and forth between Oregon and California over the next few years. But recently the wolf's behavior changed. He began to spend his time in a relatively small area in southwestern Oregon.

"We were curious," Stephenson said. "His collar is getting old. We'd been getting a lot of questions about whether we would re-collar him. We weren't going to. He's a lone wolf. There's only so much information you can get."

But the scientists decided to make one last effort to see if he found a mate, Stephenson said. "I put some cameras out. I'm glad we did. I'm still very surprised by it. It's pretty cool."

The two wolves had never been photographed together, which made it hard to be sure. But on May 3, biologists caught a break. At 6:30 a.m., OR7 was photographed walking by one of the cameras. An hour later, the female ran past the same spot.

"They're in the same area," Stephenson said. "They certainly know about each other... It's very likely they've paired up."

Now, wolf packs are back and roaming widely in the West. Wildlife officials say it is likely California will be home to a number of wolves within 10 years.

LEAVENWORTH, Wash. — Biologist Don Youkey reached overhead to a log nailed to a tree. He hung a cow knucklebone and chunk of raw rib meat over the log.

When someone yawns near you, you yawn too. The same is true among chimpanzees and baboons. Even dogs do it. They all seem to "catch" a yawn when someone near them yawns. But why? Scientists believe it is a sign that these animals can feel empathy.

## "Guts And Confidence"

In that job, he often had to repair old wooden coasters. So Grubb and his engineers decided there must be a better way.

Traditional wooden roller coasters have simple steel plates lining the track where the wheels go. Rocky Mountain instead built a steel trap around the wood track. That makes it much stronger.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — They may have "rat" in their name, but the Allegheny woodrats are nothing like ordinary rats. They don't run across subway rails or leap out of big city garbage cans. Instead, these native New Jerseyans like the quiet life outside of big towns and look more like jolly, oversized field mice.

But times are tough for woodrats. Once common from New England to Alabama, they have disappeared from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. There are far fewer of them in Pennsylvania these days, and they are nearly gone from Ohio and Indiana.

The problem is that woodrats pick up dried raccoon droppings. The droppings often still have seeds and berries in them that woodrats can eat. But they can also have roundworm eggs in them as well. "The eggs can last practically forever," Valent said. Woodrats swallow the eggs, which get into their bloodstream and organs. If the eggs reach the woodrats' brain, they "can cause death."

Valent has a two-part plan to stop Bergen's woodrats from dying off. Twice a year, in spring and fall, Valent travels by boat along the Hudson. He lands at the hard-to-get areas where woodrats live. There, he sets out bait for raccoons, mixed with medicine that kills roundworms. The bait includes ground-up fish and marshmallow fluff. "They love anything sweet," Valent said.

But it's a challenging battle. Field mice, which raccoons eat, are also made sick by roundworm. If a raccoon free of worms eats a sick mouse, it gets worms all over again.

Hassinger has become quite fond of the woodrat. He even doesn't like that they are called "rats." In fact, he wrote a poem about it.

"It ain't wood and it ain't rat," the poem reads. "These misnomers [wrong names] are a bummer — not funny; we call it the boulder bunny."

Now, a team of scientists has pieced together the genome of a giant animal known as the woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths were the long-haired ancestors of today's elephants. The mammoths died out thousands of years ago.

## A Chance Discovery

Workers at fast-food restaurants are accusing some employers of wage theft. They say the restaurants failed to pay them what they're owed.

They are going to court to get back their wages. Lawsuits have been filed in three states. States have also gotten employers to pay big money to settle such cases.

On Thursday, workers protested in front of three McDonald's and Burger King restaurants in Kansas City, Mo. Some of their signs said "wage theft" and "stolen wages." The protest was organized by the StandUpKC coalition. Fast-food workers and religious leaders were there. Members of labor unions also protested. Unions represent groups of workers to help fight for better pay and rights.

There were many wage theft protests in the U.S. in March. The protests come as President Obama and others in Washington push for an increase in the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage). The minimum wage is the lowest amount an employer is allowed to pay a worker.

Michael Saltsman is a spokesman for the Employment Policies Institute. His group generally supports the owners of restaurants. He said his group doesn't take such surveys very seriously. Some wage theft surely exists, he said. But people think it happens more because the supporters of workers unions push the idea, he said.

Our education system and worker training are to blame. If nothing is fixed, the supply of skilled workers will decrease even more — leaving some 5 million jobs empty by 2018. We won't have enough skilled workers to keep pace with the needs of employers. The problem is called a "skills gap."

## A New Approach

Talent pipeline management isn't much different from the idea behind supply chains. Companies use these ideas to get their parts, money or information. It involves relationships based on demand between customers and users. In this case, the suppliers are schools and the users are the companies that hire the students.

Rolls-Royce used this idea when it built its huge auto factory in Virginia.

It spent $170 million on the first-ever Rolls-Royce factory to be built from the ground up on U.S. soil. Before spending all that money, the company wanted to be sure that it would have a supply of skilled workers.

So it partnered with the local community college. Together, they established a program to teach students the manufacturing process. Since starting this partnership, Rolls-Royce has helped design course work and trained students on the machines used at the factory.

A new report says that the world isn't getting smaller. It's getting fatter.

In general, people around the world were fatter in 2013 than in 1980, the study found. More people are now [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) — extremely overweight. That goes for everyone — men and women, children and adults, rich and poor. The report was published in The Lancet, a respected medical journal.

In 1980, 857 million people on the planet were overweight. In 2013, that number grew to 2.1 billion people.

It's not just that the global population is larger and so more people weigh too much. In 1980, about 29 men out of 100 were overweight. In 2013, almost 37 men out of 100 were overweight. The numbers were similar for women.

All over the world, as time went on people got bigger. People gained the most weight between the ages of 20 and 40.

The U.S. national soccer team is in Brazil, playing in soccer's biggest event, the World Cup.

Things were very different 64 years ago, when Walter Bahr and his U.S. teammates took off for Brazil. Bahr is one of two surviving members of the 1950 U.S. soccer team. That year was the last time Brazil hosted the sport's global showcase.

Some Brazilians are angry about World Cup spending of $11.5 billion in a nation with tens of millions of poor. A good showing by the Brazilian team could relieve much — but not all — of that anger.

Why? Because when people read stories, they imagine what it is like to be in these stories, Mar says.

We try to understand these characters by using our brain in the same way that helps us understand people in the real world. We start "walking in their shoes." We imagine ourselves as them. Then we are better able to treat others well, he says.

## A Continuing Journey

NEW YORK — In the summer of 1914, American writer Henry James knew that something had been lost forever.

















Famous baseball catcher Lawrence Peter Berra, died Tuesday. He was better known by his nickname "Yogi." Berra was 90 years old. He was famous for his funny sayings. One of them was "Nobody goes there any more. It's too crowded," he once said, talking about a popular restaurant.

Another famous one was "It ain't over till it's over," which people still say today.

He was married for 65 years to his wife Carmen, who died in 2014.

They are behaving better. Reports of bears damaging property or injuring people have really dropped off. In 1998, there were 1,584 reports. There were just 120 last year.

"The numbers are down, and that's awesome," said Ryan Leahy. He is an expert on bears at Yosemite. "More and more people are doing what they are supposed to do."

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Firefighters finally began to get a handle on the huge Rim Fire near Yosemite National Park. But the blaze had already destroyed one popular San Francisco Bay Area family camp and damaged another.

News of the loss brought the fire home to generations of Bay Area campgoers.

David Kojan said his family was very upset. "We have so many happy memories there, and it was a place we always look forward to returning," Kojan said. He is one of many Berkeley natives who cherished his visits. He, his wife and two young sons would go to the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp.

The cost of the fire has gone over $20 million. President Barack Obama promised government money in a call to Gov. Jerry Brown. On Monday, Brown visited with some of the firefighters battling the biggest of California's nearly dozen large wildfires. The fires were burning from Eureka in the north to Los Angeles in the south, stretching money in peak wildfire season. Brown said "the firefighters have a real challenge on their hands" but promised to "get it done" with the money and manpower they have.

Dirt lines dug by firefighters around the edge of the Rim Fire and air drops of water finally started to pay off.

"Slowly but surely, we are making progress," said Daniel Berlant. He is the Cal Fire spokesman.

But it was too late to save the city-run Berkeley Tuolumne camp. It first opened 91 years ago. Back then, it cost $1 a day and 60 cents for children. The fire burned most of the 80 buildings, including 72 tent cabins.

A Sierra Nevada red fox was just spotted in Yosemite National Park. This is the first time the rare animal has been seen there in almost 100 years.

Migration has transformed Oxkutzcab (pronounced OHSH-kootz-CAHB). This town is mostly made up of ethnic Mayan people. It has sent thousands of migrants to the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of them work in restaurants there.

## Coming Home

About 70,000 Yucatecans live in the Bay Area. Smaller groups are in Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. Many speak mainly Mayan, and only a little Spanish.

The migration has brought many changes to towns such as this one. It has brought some wealth. It has also affected matters ranging from crime and drug use to the way husbands treat wives.

"The place has changed, some for the better, some for the worse," said Gilmer Ruiz, a 35-year-old butcher. He spent 10 years working in kitchens in the Bay Area. Ruiz walks with a cane. He broke his leg in multiple places when he fell off the border fence trying to cross into Arizona.

## From Dishwashers To Chefs

Knecht thinks the old village was a winter gathering place on the Arolik River. The Yu'pik left after the river shifted. This part of the world is famous for its unusual geography. Ocean currents and rivers are constantly rearranging the landscape.

"Most of (the site) may have been washed away already," Knecht said. "We may just be looking at a portion of it. Maybe a quarter of the original site is left — and it's going fast." The ocean has already taken out the original dig site, he pointed out.

QUINHAGAK, Alaska — An ancient Yup'ik village has been frozen in place for hundreds of years. The Bering Sea coast it sits on has begun to wash away. Now, scientists from around the world are digging up its artifacts before they are all gone.

The scientists say it's the biggest dig of Yup'ik artifacts from its time period. Yup'ik people lived in the village before Russians and other Europeans arrived in the early 1800s.

Why? "Because we had nothing," said Warren Jones. He is president of the village. Yup'ik culture, including language and traditional dance, was discouraged by missionaries who came to build churches. The missionaries were from the Eastern European Moravian church and they wanted to spread their own culture across Alaska. The Yup'ik culture was almost lost, Jones said.

In just the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig has been lost.

KLAMATH, Calif. — Lauren Alvarado says it simply: Drugs are "everywhere in Indian country."

She got clean with the help of a Yurok wellness program. It puts traditional tribal values to work to heal addicted Yurok men and women. The Yurok tribe of almost 6,000 is the largest in California. The tribe's ancestral lands and reservations sit along the banks of the Klamath River.

Alvarado was one of those. She sought out wellness court coordinator Anthony Trombetti. A minor arrest had left her facing a choice.

Lori Nesbitt works for the wellness court. She pores over county jail logs to find people who need help. She snoops with aunts and uncles of tribal members who go before the court to see how they're really doing.

The zebras travel between two countries in a part of southern Africa. Wildlife experts discovered the journey after attaching tracking devices to some of the zebras.

The finding is a rare bright spot. Nowadays, large groups of wildlife traveling together are hard to find. Human land use has limited animal migrations. One study on the subject found sad news. Plants and animals disappear much faster now than before humans arrived on the scene.

The zebra trip occurs in a huge area of southern Africa. The area includes national parks at a spot where five African countries meet.

"It goes to show us that nature still has some surprises," said Robin Naidoo. Naidoo is a nature scientist at the World Wildlife Fund. The WWF led the two-year study on the migration.

Wildebeest also migrate, but in the Serengeti in East Africa. It's possible that they cover more ground than these zebras, but they wander around more. And more wildebeest migrate at a time.

Thousands of Brazilian babies born last year have unusually small heads. Many may also have crippling brain damage. 

ORLANDO, Fla. — U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder on Tuesday asked members of the NAACP to help get rid of stand-your-ground laws. Holder, the first black to be the nation's top law enforcement official, said the laws "senselessly expand the concept of self-defense."

A small smile began at the corners of his mouth when the jurors left the courtroom. It very slowly spread.

"You have no further business with this court," the judge told him.

Then Zimmermann's side of the courtroom exploded in hugs.

"I have two sons of my own," Cathy Cole, one of the protesters, said. "I think the child was murdered." Zimmerman, 29, had been charged in the shooting of Martin on Feb. 26, 2012. The shooting happened in in Sanford, in central Florida.

Zimmermann said that he shot Martin in self-defense when the teenager attacked him. Prosecutors argued that he had stalked the 17-year-old Martin. The teenager was returning from a convenience store after buying Skittles and a soft drink. Wearing the now-famous hoodie sweat shirt, Martin was walking in the rain back to the home where he was staying.

Martin's family and supporters left the courtroom silently after the verdict was read. Some cried.

"We are very, very, very saddened, but we accept the jury's verdict in this case," said Daryl Parks. He is one of the lawyers for the Martin family. Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, and Tracy Martin, his father, "are just heartbroken," he added.

## Debate About Racial Profiling

Local police had accepted Zimmerman's explanation that he acted in self-defense. Weeks of protests followed and a special prosecutor eventually charged Zimmermann in the shooting.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Saturday night called on the U.S. Department of Justice to file new charges against Zimmerman.

Supporters argued that if a black man had shot an unarmed white teenager, authorities would have been less likely to accept the self-defense argument. Zimmerman considers himself Latino, which is his mother's background.

The debate reached all the way to the White House.

"Obviously, this is a tragedy," President Barack Obama said last year. "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."

CHICAGO, Ill. — As zip-lining becomes more popular, more people are getting hurt, a new study says.

Still, some people scoffed. They said Zuckerberg was promoting Facebook's own interests. He just wrapped it up in noble-sounding words, they said. It's not the first time that people have questioned his efforts.

Helping more people get online is clearly in Facebook's interest, said longtime Silicon Valley observer Paul Saffo. It also shows a recent thing that is happening in business, he said. Rich business people used to wait until they retired to support causes.  Now they're expected to do it while running their companies.
