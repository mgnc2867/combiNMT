"We will right that wrong, and when the new, redesigned $10 note is released, it will bear the portrait of a woman," he said at the National Archives in Washington.

The Girl Scouts endorsed Juliette Gordon Low, who founded the organization in 1912 in Savannah, Georgia.

The Treasury expects to unveil the new $10 bill in 2020, the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. The department can't specify when the new notes will start circulating, because selection and design of the image will be followed by an exhaustive production process. The redesign of the $100 note issued in October 2013 took about 14 years.

Another candidate could be Frances Perkins, Labor secretary from 1933 to 1945 and the first woman appointed to the Cabinet, Wolfers said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, is backing Perkins.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — These days, anybody with a smartphone can snap a selfie in a split second. Back in the Dutch Golden Age, they were called self-portraits and were the preserve of highly trained artists who thought long and hard about every aspect of the painting.

A less well-known artist, Huygh Pietersz Voskuyl, is the poster boy for the exhibition. His striking 1638 self-portrait features a classic selfie pose; staring over his right shoulder out of the frame. It does not take much imagination to picture him gazing into the lens of a smartphone rather than a mirror, which Golden Age artists used to capture their images for self-portraits. Giant mirrors are spread through the exhibition space, creating reflections within reflections of paintings that are themselves mirror images.

That kind of attention to detail and quality made the self-portraits almost a Golden Age calling card — showcasing the artist and his or her talents to potential clients.

WASHINGTON — The group pushing to replace President Andrew Jackson with a woman on the $20 bill has revealed its final four candidates after more than 256,000 votes were placed.

The four are former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, abolitionist Harriet Tubman, civil rights activist Rosa Parks and Wilma Mankiller, the first woman elected chief of a major Native American tribe. Voting for the finalist is now open. The group behind the push, Women on 20s, has not yet set a specific end date for the final vote.

Griffin Matuszek, who was born without part of his left hand, found his traditional prosthetic mostly useless and a bit scary, said his mother, Quinn Cassidy. So she began researching alternatives. When someone sent the family a link to Chi's work on 3-D hands, Cassidy's father called the doctor. Griffin's family came from North Bethesda, Maryland, to Baltimore to get his first printed hand. The 5-year-old requested one that glowed in the dark.

Hand parts take up to 10 hours to print and another couple of hours to assemble with elastic cords to keep the hands open. Kids make them grasp by flexing their palms or wrists. Extra cords can be used to strap them on kids with more extensive limb loss.

Not the one out the tiny windows of the half-underground office. It's on a smartphone that computer science Prof. Stergios Roumeliotis is using while walking around the depths of the University of Minnesota's Walter Library.

On the screen, a three-dimensional map of a nearby hallway has taken shape. The map was made by holding the smartphone's camera while moving. The camera and the phone's motion sensor worked together to create a grid of data points that became a 3-D image.

It's a radical new ability for smartphones and promises to enable consumers to create 3-D maps on the fly. The software development is being handled by UM grad students who are funded by $1.35 million grant from Google Inc. The work is part of the company's recently announced Project Tango, a cellphone optimized for 3-D mapping.

Results from the 2012 Program of International Student Assessment showed that U.S. teenagers were in the bottom half for financial literacy among the 18 countries that participated, ahead of France and Spain, but below Latvia, Russia and China. There are now 17 states that require high school students to take personal-finance courses, according to the Council on Economic Education. In 2007, there were just seven.

Noah Madson remembers being exhausted after hours of tests for his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

"Boy, those were complicated," said his mother, Nancy. "He'd come out and say, 'My brain hurts.' " Today, Noah's task is less of a headache. After the 14-year-old plays a video game for 20 minutes, his parents and teachers will have data that paint a comprehensive picture of how his mind is functioning.

The game that CogCubed is testing now uses Sifteo, a platform that consists of small cubes with screens on them. The game, called "Groundskeeper," asks the user to use one cube — the mallet — to hit a gopher that pops up on the screens of the other three cubes. As the game goes on, distractions like rabbits and chirping birds come up, and the instructions change.

The cubes produce data on more than 70 different variables, including errors, response times and even whether the player is fidgeting. Those data come together in a Web portal that clinicians, parents and teachers can use to evaluate a child's cognitive function in a very specific way.

"That's part of our excitement with it, that we're getting so much detailed information," Nancy Madson said. "I can't wait for it to affect (Noah's) education plan for the coming year."

This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released record numbers for ADHD diagnoses: 11 percent of school-aged children have been diagnosed with the disorder, including nearly 1 in 5 high-school-age boys.

It's not clear what's behind the increased numbers, which represented a 41 percent jump in the past decade and contributed to an FDA shortage of commonly prescribed ADHD medicines in 2011.

It's important that products that tout improvement of cognitive function stay away from broad claims and focus their research on long-term effects, said Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist who serves on the professional advisory board for Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

The amount of data that CogCubed collects could make it a game-changer in the mental health field, Heller said.

While a computer-based test just measures errors, the Sifteo cubes' sensors measure every move in between. That means there's less room for misdiagnosis — and more room to grow.

The results of the pilot study at Noah's school, Groves Academy, could help teachers customize lesson plans for each student's particular needs, Groves' assistant director of diagnostics Zach Eakman said.

WASHINGTON — For decades, Asian-Americans have clustered on the coasts, but in recent years thousands have moved to the South, remaking communities in the process.

Between 2000 and 2010, Asian-Americans were the fastest-growing ethnic group in the South, increasing 69 percent during that period, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which advocates on behalf of the community.

State by state, the growth is even more striking. Some states saw their Asian-American populations nearly double between 2000 and 2010: In both Georgia and North Carolina, the increases topped 80 percent. The average growth among the 16 states and the District of Columbia (which the census identifies as the South) was 63 percent. Twelve states and the District saw increases of 50 percent or more.

YUENDUMU, Australia — The elders of the Warlpiri Aboriginal tribe in outback Australia look at a person's footprints: A good person, it's believed, leaves good prints in the red dust.

Four years ago, Sebastian Watson's footsteps were said to have turned bad for a time: He had a brush with the law and was charged with assault. The elders of the remote Yuendumu community sent him off into the bush to Mount Theo, a retreat where Peggy Brown and her husband cared for him along with other troubled young people.

Brown, her face as wrinkled as the stony hills that rise from the surrounding desert, knew how to make Watson healthy on the outside with good food and clean living. She also worked to make him strong on the inside, immersing him in the ancient Warlpiri culture, with its deep connections to land, kin and ceremony.

Desperate, the elders called a community meeting that came up with the Mount Theo retreat plan. Sending them far away into the bush was part punishment but also meant to heal and to teach the Warlpiri culture. Mount Theo was chosen because it was believed to have ancient healing qualities.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/US_NEWS_CPT-TEEN-ENTREPRENEUR-ADV04_4_SJ.jpg" />SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Last December, seventh-grader Shubham Banerjee asked his parents how blind people read.

A Silicon Valley tech professional, dad Neil Banerjee told his son to "Google it."

So Shubham did, and with a few Internet searches he learned about Braille, the tactile writing system used by the blind, and Braille printers, which, to the 12-year-old's shock, cost thousands of dollars. One school science fair victory, a few national accolades, $35,000 of his parents' savings and a visit to the White House later, Shubham today is the founder of Palo Alto startup Braigo Labs, which aims to become the first purveyor of low-cost, compact Braille printers.

A ceremony with Prince Charles at the Cathedral of Bayeux, just south of the beaches, left British veteran Richard England deeply shaken.

"It brought it all back, I'm afraid — all the boys I lost, my brother-in-law who was killed almost at the end, and the lovely chaps that fought with me who were older than me and are no longer with us," said England, of the 8th Durham Infantry Battalion. "They weren't here, unfortunately."

Several thousand veterans, family members and others gathered at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, with its 9,387 white marble tombstones on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, the emotional centerpiece of American pilgrimages to honor the men killed in Normandy.

"It was hard," Peasant said, dabbing her eyes with a tissue.

WASHINGTON — More than a million small drone aircraft have been sold in the past few years, and a growing number of them are turning up in the skies near airports and airliners, posing a risk of collision. Reports of drone sightings near other planes, helicopters and airfields are reaching the government almost daily, say federal and industry officials.

The reports underscore the difficulty the FAA faces trying to control drones, which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine. Small drones usually are not visible on radar to air traffic controllers, particularly if they're made of plastic or other composites.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Lynda Walsh, a court-appointed advocate for children from Delray Beach, Florida, wants kids to look fashionable no matter how tight of a budget they are on.

Once she started helping at the West Palm Beach courthouse, she saw how shabbily dressed the kids were when they showed up to court.

To open the Cool Clothes Closet, Walsh said she asked friends and family to donate clothes and help set up the space. She said her 93-year-old mother helps wash and iron donated clothes.

The Clothes Closet, which opened its doors about four months ago, has drawn young customers through word-of-mouth recommendations, and the handful of children assisted so far have been grateful, Walsh said.

Roberta Mizrahi, who volunteers at the Clothes Closet, said the kids are often shy about trying on the clothes, but they perk up with excitement when they try on something they like.

"I think it's wonderful," she said.

Muinos sees about 30 children every Friday as part of the Weight Management Program. Muinos works to create individualized plans based on the age of the child and height and the child's body mass index. Growing children are placed in a percentile based on their age and gender.

He starts by encouraging vegetables and reducing starchy food from the child's diet. He also develops a "doable" exercise plan that can be anything from walking to going to the gym.

For Jose Carlos Sanchez, the past two months have been a complete change in lifestyle. He was referred to Muinos by his pediatrician because the 14-year-old weighed nearly 250 pounds. He has already lost about 20 pounds and is motivated to continue down the right path.

"I feel much better about myself," said Sanchez, who lives in Hialeah, Florida, and is going into the eighth grade. "I have a lot more energy."

His mom, Mayelin Govea, said she is very happy that the doctor was able to get her son's weight under control.

ORLANDO, Fla. — A bunch of Coyotes will be let loose in hurricanes this year with the goal of improving intensity forecasts.

The drone's spring-loaded wings will lock into place and its small electric motor will spin up, allowing it to fly at speeds up to 70 miles per hour. Then the little plane will do what no other aircraft can — spend up to two hours spiraling around the core of a hurricane, allowing forecasters to receive detailed information about its inner workings.

On Sunday, city crews moved the actual finish line, the burled arch, into place, and public works employees trucked in snow to give the mushers a path once they leave the Bering Sea ice.

"Yeah, I know, it's funny to see people dumping snow on a street instead of taking it off the street," said Greg Bill, the Iditarod's development director. "To really dress it up and make it safe for the dog teams, we have to spread a layer of snow down for them to run on."

King last won in 2006 and is trying to be only the second musher to win five races.

Zirkle has come in second place in the last two years in the nearly 1,000-mile race to Nome, 171 miles west of Koyuk. She is seeking to become only the third woman to win the race, and the first woman to win since the late Susan Butcher in 1990.

Other front-runners Sunday were four-time champion Martin Buser, who arrived in Koyuk in third place at 4:20 p.m. Sunday, followed 13 minutes later by 2012 Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey. Veteran musher Sonny Lindner arrived in fifth place at 4:47 p.m., followed by defending champion Mitch Seavey, father of Dallas Seavey, at 5:23 p.m.

"Any dogs that can laugh when they run, with their tongues hanging out, they got my heart right now," said Cross, who just learned about the volunteer programs and already is making plans to be back in Nome next year.

The race began March 2 in Willow with 69 teams. As of late Sunday morning, 16 mushers had scratched, leaving 53 teams on the trail, which was marked by long stretches of bare and rocky ground that made for an icy, treacherous trail in the early part of the race.

Major construction on the highly anticipated Westside subway extension won't begin until next year, but an exploratory shaft dug at the corner of Ogden Drive to assess soil conditions for future stations and tunnels has burped up a bonanza of prehistoric swag. Officials had anticipated encountering a substantial cache: The dig is near the La Brea Tar Pits and features a sandy matrix with naturally occurring asphalt — a fossil haven.

Paleontologists have recovered mollusks, asphalt-saturated sand dollars, pieces of driftwood and Monterey cypress cones. For Scott, the most exciting finds have been a rock embedded with what appears to be part of a sea lion's mouth (perhaps 2 million years old) and a non-fossilized 10-foot limb from a digger pine tree that would look right at home today in Central California woodlands.

If Chester Nez dared to use his Navajo language in school, punishment was swift and literally distasteful. He had to scrub his tongue with a toothbrush and wash out his mouth with bitter soap.

That day, four months after Japanese bombs fell on Pearl Harbor, Nez helped form an elite, top-secret group that became known as the Navajo code talkers. Using the Navajo language, they developed an unbreakable military communications code, then risked their lives on battlefields across the Pacific to send and decipher messages critical to America and its allies in World War II.

He didn't have to volunteer; barred from voting, [Native Americans](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American) were barely considered citizens. But Nez's heritage spoke louder than decades of rejection. "I reminded myself that my Navajo people had always been warriors, protectors," he wrote years later. "In that there was honor. I would concentrate on being a warrior, on protecting my homeland."

After Guadalcanal, Nez never stopped moving, encrypting, relaying and deciphering messages about enemy positions, Allied strategy, casualties and supplies — at the Battle of Bougainville in New Guinea in November 1943, Guam in July 1944 and Peleliu and Angaur in September 1944. The code talkers were so vital to the war effort that they were not permitted leaves.

The team that has famously gotten the most out of some talented players viewed as character risks — among them receiver Randy Moss and running back Corey Dillon — has had to exercise damage control in the wake of Aaron Hernandez's arrest on first-degree murder charges.

New England took a chance, however, selecting the troubled University of Florida standout in the fourth round of the 2010 draft — seemingly a bargain for a player many evaluators considered a first-round talent. For three seasons, the move paid off, with Hernandez reaching the Pro Bowl in 2011 and garnering a five-year contract extension worth as much as $40 million.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in the slaying of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd and is being held without bail in a Massachusetts jail. Less than two hours after his arrest on June 26, Hernandez was released by the Patriots. To further distance itself from him, the franchise took the unprecedented step of a jersey exchange. Fans with used Hernandez jerseys can swap them at the team store this weekend for those of any other player on the roster.

The high-profile arrest of Hernandez and the subsequent flood of information about his troubled past has sparked a debate within the NFL: When is a risky pick too risky?

There were warning signs with Hernandez, who had failed drug tests and run-ins with the law in college. A scouting service that prepares confidential psychological profiles of NFL prospects determined that he enjoyed "living on the edge of acceptable behavior," according to a document obtained by the Wall Street Journal.

Darnell Hunt, a media and race expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said only time would tell whether Sharpton's goals come to fruition. "But there does seem to be something very palpable in terms of a rising awareness around questions of race and fairness," Hunt said.

The WHO hailed Nigeria's "spectacular success story" and the country's "world-class epidemiological detective work." Nigeria has also reduced polio cases and eradicated guinea worm.

"If a country like Nigeria, hampered by serious security problems, can do this — that is, make significant progress toward interrupting polio transmission, eradicate guinea worm and contain Ebola, all at the same time — any country in the world experiencing an imported case can hold onward transmission to just a handful of cases," Dr. Margaret Chan, WHO director general, said in a statement Monday.

At the outset, things looked bad. When Ebola hit Lagos, the country was in the middle of a strike by doctors and nurses. Dr. Doyin Oduyebo, a microbiologist at the forefront of the Nigerian effort to contain the virus, said medical authorities initially feared the disease would race out of control.

"We were afraid because we knew the epidemic was raging in other West African countries," Oduyebo said in a phone interview. "So we decided to give it everything to bring it under control."

Dr. Morris Ibeawuchi examined Sawyer at the hospital. Sawyer and the ECOWAS protocol official with him concealed the fact that he had collapsed at the airport, and Sawyer lied about the fact that he had been in close contact with an Ebola victim, Ibeawuchi told a Lagos news conference last month. Sawyer claimed he had malaria.

Malala, who was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi, has become a symbol of hope in her homeland, Pakistan, where girls are sometimes slain by their families in "honor killings" if they dare to marry for love, or are kept out of school in deeply conservative communities.

The award comes as girls are under attack by extremists in countries such as Nigeria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and are routinely abused in nations including India, Somalia and South Africa.

TOKYO — First lady Michelle Obama, saying it's an "injustice" that 62 million girls around the world are not in school, joined forces with her Japanese counterpart, Akie Abe, Thursday, saying they would promote education for girls in developing countries.

The present 2,400-point maximum was introduced with the start of the required essay seven years ago. The new optional essay test will be graded separately on a scale that is still under consideration, said officials of the College Board, which owns the widely used exam.

However, some experts said making the essay optional sends a bad and perplexing message.

"I'm not sure it is a good signal to kids in schools about the importance of writing," said Katy Murphy, president of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. The change also will confuse high school seniors who may not have access to good counseling and may be unsure how to fulfill testing requirements that will vary among different colleges, said Murphy, director of college counseling at Bellarmine College Preparatory high school in San Jose, Calif.

In one area, the College Board will be making it potentially more difficult for students. Now test takers are allowed to use calculators throughout the math questions. But starting in two years, calculators will be banned during some of the math testing to better asses students' "understanding, fluency and technique," the announcement said. Another change will be that the SAT will start to be offered online as well as in the traditional paper form. 
SEATTLE — Suicide stalks Indian Country, claiming more lives of native youth than those in any other population, not only in Washington state, but nationally.

State Department of Health statistics released this month show that in Washington, the rate of suicide among native youth from 10 to 24 years old was more than double the rate of any other ethnic population.

At the Lummi Nation, tribal leaders last year enhanced a long-standing social services program with a youth suicide prevention component. The Colville, Spokane and Yakama tribesalso are utilizing prevention grants and training through the Native Aspirations Program. The Spokane-based program for the past five years has helped 65 tribes across the country combat suicide, the second-biggest killer of native youth, after accidents.

"The car accident, the gun death, the overdose, there are a lot of suicides that are not reported as such," said Victoria Wagner, executive director of the Youth Suicide Prevention Program, a nonprofit based in Seattle with outreach workers across the state working with schools and parent groups to teach the warning signs of suicide and prevention strategies.

In Indian Country, poverty, isolation, lack of adequate resources to treat mental health issues, substance abuse and family problems compound the risks of youth suicide, Wagner said. "There is this feeling of being trapped, and having nowhere to go."

At a recent prevention training session at the Lummi Youth Academy outside Bellingham, the emphasis was on the positive.

But she has a friend she knows is going through a rough patch. "When I don't hear from him, I worry about it."

BISMARCK, N.D. — Theodore Roosevelt's love of the country's untouched, natural beauty spurred him to create and conserve hundreds of national forests, parks and monuments during his presidency. His legacy, though, is being preserved digitally.

A devoted group of scholars and Roosevelt admirers has been scanning his papers and artifacts for years and is finishing a design for a library and museum commemorating the life of the 26th president. Unlike the presidential libraries that came before it, however, the Roosevelt library will feature a collection that is primarily digital.

The physical library is expected to open in 2019 in Dickinson, a city of about 20,000 residents about 35 miles east of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in western North Dakota, which includes ranchland that was once his. However, the library has already made thousands of notes, letters and photographs available online.

Organizers hope that learning about Roosevelt's life and experiencing first-hand the raw beauty he saw in the badlands will present visitors with the complete picture of the man in the place that's often called the "cradle of conservation," and would lead the former president to write: "It was here that the romance of my life began."
Minutes after arriving by bus at an outlet mall in Cabazon, California, a dozen or so Chinese tourists hustled out to buy luggage that they planned to stuff with high-end clothes, shoes and bags.

But not Guoshing Cui, a Samsung supervisor from Guangzhou. He made a beeline for the Coach store, where he picked out three expensive handbags. He paid more than $800 from a wad of $100 bills.

The bags were gifts for family and friends in China, where Coach goods sell for two to three times the price in the U.S. "It's a smart move," he said of his purchases.

That kind of power shopping has made the Chinese tourist the highest-spending overseas visitor to the U.S. and one of the most valued customers for U.S. outlet malls, shopping centers and tour bus operators.

"What we know about Chinese visitors is they don't like to lay on the beaches," said Ernest Wooden Jr., president of the Los Angeles Tourism and Convention Board. "What they do like is shopping."

The outpouring of Chinese money helped set a record for spending by foreign visitors to the U.S. — $168.1 billion in 2012, according to federal officials.

Japanese tourists, according to travel surveys, spend heavily at restaurants because certain foods, particularly red meat, are much more expensive in the island nation.

Many Chinese visitors also stock up on vitamins in the U.S. because they are suspicious of the quality of supplements sold in China.

During a recent visit to the U.S., Ding Sheng, a tourist from Guangzhou, China, said he took a tour to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and was planning to see the casinos of Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon. But he said a shopping outing to the Cabazon outlet mall was the highlight of the trip.

"These are gifts for my friends," he said as he shopped for Ugg shoes, priced at $149 a pair. Although Chinese tourists spend heavily on gifts and souvenirs, the travelers typically skimp on food and lodging, tour guides say.

NOVOAZOVSK, Ukraine — Two columns of Russian tanks and military vehicles fired Grad missiles at a border post in southeastern Ukraine, then rolled into the country Thursday as Ukraine's overmatched border guards fled, a top Ukrainian official said.

A top NATO official said at least 1,000 Russian troops have poured into Ukraine with sophisticated equipment and have been in direct "contact" with Ukrainian soldiers, resulting in casualties. He called that a conservative estimate and said another 20,000 Russian troops were right over the Russian border.

President Petro Poroshenko summoned the council as the strategic southeastern town of Novoazovsk appeared firmly under the control of separatists and their Russian backers, a new front in the war in eastern Ukraine between the separatists and Poroshenko's government in Kiev.

"We have also detected large quantities of advanced weapons, including air defense systems, artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers being transferred to separatist forces in eastern Ukraine," he said. "The presence of these weapons along with substantial numbers of Russian combat troops inside Ukraine make the situation increasingly grave."

The leader of the insurgency, Alexander Zakharchenko, said in an interview on Russian state television that 3,000 to 4,000 Russians have fought on the separatist side since the armed conflict began in April.

The U.S. government accused Russia of orchestrating a new military campaign in Ukraine, helping rebel forces expand their fight and sending in tanks, rocket launchers and armored vehicles.

"These incursions indicate a Russian-directed counteroffensive is likely underway in Donetsk and Luhansk," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Wednesday. She voiced concern about overnight deliveries of materiel in southeast Ukraine near Novoazovsk and said Russia was being dishonest about its actions, even to its own people.

Russian forces, she said, are being sent 30 miles (48 kilometers) inside Ukraine, without them or their families knowing where they are going. She cited reports of burials in Russia for those who have died in Ukraine and wounded Russian soldiers being treated in a St. Petersburg hospital.

Geologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are doing just that, as part of two experiments located at dangerous faults in New Zealand and Japan — faults that could rupture at any moment, causing massive earthquakes.

"We're seeing rocks much closer to what they are like down where earthquakes do their thing," Thurber said.
SAN FRANCISCO — Finally moving to end a dispute that besmirched its hip, all-American brand with charges of religious intolerance, retail fashion giant Abercrombie &amp; Fitch has agreed to change a controversial policy dictating employee dress and grooming in response to discrimination lawsuits filed by two San Francisco Bay Area women.

In a settlement announced Monday, the popular, youth-oriented national chain agreed to change its "look policy" to provide better protections for women wearing Muslim headscarves, said lawyers for Hani Khan, 23, of Foster City. Khan was fired from a part-time job in 2010 at a store owned by Abercrombie in San Mateo because she refused to remove her hijab. The religious garment ran afoul of Abercrombie's detailed rules governing the physical appearance of the people who work at its stores — including the Hollister Co. outlets involved in the lawsuits.

"The simple term would be spoiled brat," he said.

ANDKHOY, Afghanistan — When Esmatullah got engaged in 1999, he was a 26-year-old day laborer eager to wed, through an arranged marriage, a young girl from a village near his native Andkhoy, in western Afghanistan. Fourteen years later, Esmatullah is still waiting.

Afghan weddings brim with long-standing traditions, and one of them is the custom known as walwar. It requires the groom-to-be to pay cold cash to the bride's father. The amounts negotiated between the families can exceed $20,000, a sum far beyond the means of working-class Afghans.

In Andkhoy, a town of carpet makers and wheat farmers, many fiances borrow from relatives and friends and pay the money back over months or years. For common laborers like Esmatullah, the amount is hopelessly out of reach. His would-be in-laws insist on $13,000. Friends and relatives lent him $8,000, but he has no way of coming up with the rest.

"I make $6 a day as a day laborer," says Esmatullah, who, like many Afghans, uses one name. "God knows how long it will take me to raise the rest."

Technically walwar is illegal, but it's tolerated by local authorities because it has been ingrained in Afghan tribal society for hundreds of years. Prosecution of fathers or grooms involved in walwar transactions is rare, Mostafavi says. It also unfairly shackles young grooms with burdensome debt, she says.

KABUL, Afghanistan — Hot dogs, even the non-pork variety, are rare in Afghanistan. So it was particularly unusual when five vehicles painted to look like giant frankfurters — with bright yellow mustard zigzags instead of racing stripes — popped up on the streets of the capital city this year.

Naveed Noori, a 25-year-old IT worker and university student, introduced Afghanistan to food trucks after studying the trend online and in Toronto, where his wife and baby daughter live. In May, Noori and his cousin and business partner, Abdullah Karim, launched Lazeez, which means "delicious," hawking hot dogs, burgers and chicken sandwiches out of the back of five customized three-wheelers outfitted with hot plates and mini deep-fryers.

The cousins have plans to double their fleet to 10 trucks, launch a home delivery service and produce their first video ad. For now, Noori said, they sell about $450 in food every day, enough to turn a small monthly profit but far from recovering their initial investment.

Rohit Shuja was unemployed and had never cooked before he applied to work for Lazeez. He now grills chicken and works the fryer like a pro. The biggest challenge, he said, is dealing with police officers who hassle him about parking.

BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — The doctors and therapists who worked with a little girl from Afghanistan knew the prosthetic arm they gave her would change her life.

What they didn't anticipate was that within weeks of strapping on her new limb, 7-year-old Shah Bibi Tarakhail would be using it to pick up a brush and begin carving out a new life — of abstract painting.

Less than a year ago, Shah Bibi was back at home in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) when she went outside one morning to play with her brother. There had been a violent battle pitting Taliban fighters against U.S. military forces the night before, but that was nothing residents weren't used to. Their village had been a cauldron of violence since the Afghan war began.

"There was what looked like a rock that she picked up and threw on the ground and it exploded," said Ilaha Omar, a Children of War Foundation member who brought her to the United States, where Shriners Hospital treated her for free.

The explosion had destroyed her right eye, taken off most of her right arm, put a few scars on her face and killed her brother.

BAND-E AMIR NATIONAL PARK, Afghanistan — Of all the effects of war on Afghanistan, among the most surreal — and perhaps the happiest — is swan boats.

Partly that's due to the peacefulness and startling beauty of the remote region, which is tucked away high in the Hindu Kush of central Afghanistan, and partly it's because four years ago it became Afghanistan's first national park.

The growing array of staff and facilities — including the swan boats — has made it easier for Afghans to visit, and they've been flocking here in increasing numbers, despite the fact that many have to drive a day or more and brave insurgent-infested villages and countryside en route.

Kids frolics, and families set up tents, hike, swim, grill kebabs, slice watermelon and go for a whirl in the pedal boats.

"This is my first time ever out of Kabul, and this place makes me feel really happy and calm," said Mustura Baqer, who'd driven several hours from the capital with her husband, Mohammed, a construction manager, and their 9-month-old son.

Noori, a midwife from Bamiyan, said she and her husband and their three young children had visited the park 11 times, include three trips this year.

Despite its world-class beauty, the park is little known in the West. Perhaps 20 Western visitors come in an average month, mostly aid workers from Kabul.

Like much of what people do in Afghanistan, a visit to Band-e Amir often is underpinned by religion. The Baqers' son has epilepsy, and they hoped that the powers of the waters would help.

Beliefs about the lakes' ability to heal are based on the reputed role of Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of the Prophet Muhammad, in their creation. There's a much-visited shrine to him adjacent to the landing for the pedal boats.

Ali is said to have created the lakes through various amazing feats, including a slash of his sword, and damming the resulting valley with, among other things, cheese.

The six lakes of the park are indeed dammed with a hole-ridden substance, but it's a rock called travertine, created by buildups of the minerals in the water, which mainly wells up from springs.

The dams are generally U-shaped, with hosts of small lime-green and sulfur-yellow waterfalls spilling over them, making the series of lakes like massive, watery steps that stretch for miles, each one higher than the next.

KABUL, Afghanistan _ Mohammad Aziz Ayob adjusts his Boy Scout scarf, leans over and settles a sapling into the dry Kabul soil as two NATO helicopters pass overhead, the clack-clack of their blades echoing off the neighboring mountains.

Bobbing green shirts and matching caps may seem a bit incongruous in a war zone, but organizers of Afghanistan's nascent Scouting program say its emphasis on community service and self-reliance is sorely needed in a society scarred by decades of violence.

Ayob, orphaned as a child and raised by his aunt, can barely afford to attend high school and worries about finding a job. Such concerns melt away, however, when he dons his Scouting shirt. "I love my uniform; it makes me feel proud," said Ayob, 18. "Scouts are like my family." The group's motto, "Be prepared," takes on special meaning here, where members risk death to attend meetings, earn "rule of law" merit badges and learn to identify roadside bombs in first aid class.

"If things get ugly, anything with an international connection could be targeted," said Marnie Gustavson, Parsa's executive director. "If the foreign staff becomes a liability, we'll leave." Though it's making progress, Afghan Scouting is years away from official recognition by the 161-member Geneva-based World Organization of the Scout Movement, said Abdullah Rashid, its Manila-based regional director.

"That's awesome," said Jenks, who took measurements for a new prosthesis. Over the nub of Salim's left arm, Jenks slipped a clear plastic mold and began marking it with a red Sharpie.

Wide avenues once lined with rose gardens are today gridlocked streets sandwiched by concrete blast walls protecting those inside from the bombs and bullets that form the backbeat of a 14-year insurgency. After recent deadly attacks, the towering walls multiplied almost overnight, appearing in double rows outside government buildings, businesses, embassies and the homes of powerful people.

"I want people to define who really are the heroes of my city — the people who clean the city, for instance," the 46-year-old said. "Throughout the history of Afghanistan, it's all about the people who fought, who have swords, who have guns. We want to include something else, like the people who take part in the betterment of the city and of our lives. It moves people away from the mentality of war and conflict."

Artists from his group recently painted street sweepers in orange work jackets and traditional scarves on a concrete wall surrounding Afghanistan's secret service headquarters in Kabul. Alongside is a slogan, stenciled in large black letters clearly seen by motorists in the nearby traffic-choked roundabout: "The Heroes of My City: The Street Sweepers."

Ahmad Jan, a 26-year-old day laborer, paused on a recent sunny afternoon to look at the mural. "It's interesting to Afghans. Everybody crossing the street will take a look and read the message and then get a different perspective."

Volunteer Maryam Kohi comes every day to help paint. "These cement walls are blocking the commuting routes and make the city look like a prison," she said. "Afghanistan is going through a prolonged fight and the city is polluted with dirt and corruption. With these paintings we want to take our anti-corruption message to the people."

This week, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani singled out corruption as a "cancerous lesion" threatening the survival of the state. He said it was Afghanistan's shame to be consistently named by graft watchdog Transparency International as one of the most corrupt nations on earth, and that the government had developed a "comprehensive plan" to deal with the problem through reforms and crackdowns.

KABUL, Afghanistan — The weapons of Afghanistan's long decades of war can be seen almost everywhere, from the burned-out hulks of Soviet tanks to the Kalashnikov assault rifles slung over policemen's shoulders and helicopter gunships roaring overhead.

"An awareness video was prepared as an initiative to inform people how much these toy guns can be dangerous," said Dr. Abdul Rahim Majeed, the program manager for the public Noor Eye Hospital. "Unfortunately, the families did not take it seriously and didn't pay attention to this important message and it caused many people to get injured and come to hospitals for treatments."

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama announced plans Thursday to keep nearly 10,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan through most of next year and 5,500 when he leaves office in 2017, casting aside his promise to end the war on his watch and instead ensuring he hands off the conflict to a successor.

"We don't look to Africa simply for its natural resources," Obama said. "We recognize Africa for its greatest resource, which is its people and its talents and their potential."

Other nations are already deeply invested in the continent, and the United States now realizes "we have some catching up to do … we are letting Europe and China go faster than the U.S.," said former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, whose Bloomberg Philanthropies hosted the summit, along with the U.S. Commerce Department.

The attention to Africa included a dinner at the White House late Tuesday night hosted by the president and first lady Michelle Obama. Singer Lionel Richie was to perform and the menu included touches of Africa, including beef served with chermoula, a marinade popular in North Africa.

Michler, who made a documentary film called "Blood Lions" that came out this year, said nearly 1,000 lions that are bred in captivity in South Africa are fatally shot every year by trophy seekers for an average of about $20,000, and sometimes up to $50,000, in conditions that can hardly be described as sporting. There is also an increasing phenomenon of lion owners charging tourists, many from Europe but also Australia and the United States, to pet and cuddle cubs earmarked for trophy kills when they get older, he said.

Changes like those observed by Sy, who heads the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institution in Washington, have buoyed the outlook of many on a continent that continues to experience high levels of poverty and conflict.

He noted that the region's population has also been growing rapidly. So while the economic expansion represents a notable turnaround from the woes of previous decades, poverty rates have not fallen as quickly as in other parts of the world.

More than 40 percent of the people in sub-Saharan Africa still live on less than $1.25 a day, according to the United Nations, which is preparing to ratify new goals this month that will shape the global development agenda for the next 15 years.

Analysts also see head winds on the horizon that could alter a rosy economic outlook.

Sub-Saharan Africa has benefited from high oil and other commodities prices, which have started to decline sharply. An economic slowdown in China and a sluggish recovery in Europe, some of the region's main trading partners, are also causing anxiety among the continent's leaders. So is the prospect of an increase in U.S. interest rates, which would increase the cost of borrowing on the international market.

The countries selected — Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda — are generally regarded as among the more stable on the continent.

MOSCOW — Growing up in the Soviet Union, Emilia Tynes-Mensah did the same things other children did. She read the classics of literary master Alexander Pushkin, listened to the symphonies of Peter Tchaikovsky and heard the propaganda that life here was better than anywhere else.

But in her home, there was American jazz, Thanksgiving celebrations and stories of the struggles facing blacks in the United States. An improvised version of soul food sometimes replaced borscht.

NEW YORK — Back home in Guinea, West Africa, Nasser Diallo had a law degree and a good job working as a political journalist for a radio station. That all came to an end in 2009, he said, when the military abruptly opened fire at a protest he was covering, massacring dozens "until they ran out of bullets."

"We've all heard about brain drain," said Jeanne Batalova, senior policy analyst with the MPI. "This is brain waste."

Africans from relatively prosperous, English-speaking countries such as Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa have an easier time navigating the system, according to Jeff Gross, director of the New Americans Integration Institute at the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA).

But others struggle. Among recently arrived African foreign-educated immigrants, the underemployment rate is 39 percent, compared to 20 percent of the college-educated U.S. workers and 25 percent of all foreign-educated immigrants, according to the MPI.

"The dividends of investing in this community have a multiplier effect," said Tadd Wamester, director of regional growth and online programs for Upwardly Global. "This should be looked at as going across generations. Investing in parents is also investing in children."

CHICAGO — On a recent afternoon at Chicago's Dewey Elementary Academy of Fine Arts, Ladon Brumfield asked a group of 9- and 10-year-old African-American girls to define beauty.

The nearly 20 girls unanimously agreed that if a woman had short, kinky hair, she was not beautiful. But when Brumfield, the director of a project empowering young girls, passed around a photograph of Lupita Nyong'o, the dark-brown-skinned actress who sports an extra-short natural, the girls were silent for a moment.

Then, once again, their answer was unanimous: They agreed Nyong'o was beautiful.

For more than a decade, increasing numbers of black women have been wearing their natural hair in Afros, braids, locks and twists. But now, thanks in part to Nyong'o, it's the TWA, or teenie weenie Afro, that's getting a second look and expanding notions of beauty into territory where it really hasn't taken root before — the larger culture.

Roberts said that although women considered hair that was long and straight and long and curly to be "high maintenance," they deemed the styles "healthy," "sexy" and "professional." Short hair, which Mintel defined as about jaw-length, was considered the most "professional" and "classy" of all the styles. And natural hair was viewed as being low maintenance while conveying confidence. All of the styles were considered attractive.

ST. LOUIS — High school agriculture programs sprouting across the nation's Corn Belt are teaching teenagers, many of them in urban environments, that careers in the field often have nothing to do with cows and plows.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/UN_AGING_2050_Edit.jpg" />The world is aging so fast that most countries are not prepared to support their swelling numbers of elderly people, according to a global study being issued Tuesday by the United Nations and an elder rights group.

The report ranks the social and economic well-being of elders in 91 countries, with Sweden coming out on top and Afghanistan at the bottom. It reflects what advocates for the old have been warning, with increasing urgency, for years: Nations are simply not working quickly enough to cope with a population graying faster than ever before. By the year 2050, for the first time in history, seniors older than 60 will outnumber children younger than 15.

For most of the past 15 years, Seth Wilner was the go-to guy for any and all questions about growing plants and animals in Sullivan County, New Hampshire.

"Used to be, someone in my county called up and said, 'I have a llama and two goats, can you come out and look at my pasture?'" Wilner said of his former role as an educator with the University of New Hampshire (UNH) Cooperative Extension, his state's version of a century-old, national effort to spread the latest livestock and agriculture knowledge from universities to farmers.

Extension still shares scientific research aimed at making farms and ranches more profitable. But it also works to protect the environment, ensure a safe food supply, respond to natural disasters, foster greater energy independence, help youth and adults be healthier and enhance workforce skills.

TRACY, Calif. — Investors and entrepreneurs behind some of the world's newest industries have started to put their money and tech talents into farming — the world's oldest industry — with an audacious agenda: to make sure there is enough food for the 10 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2100, do it without destroying the world and make a pretty penny along the way.

"It's going to be bigger than cloud software, it's going to be bigger than Big Data, because everybody eats," said Paul Matteucci, a partner with U.S. Venture Partners and founder of Feeding 10 Billion, a nonprofit center to help ag-tech entrepreneurs. "And it's going to be completely entrepreneur led."

Farmers, for the most part, have welcomed Silicon Valley techies into their world of planting seasons and water woes. From Salinas to Fresno to Tracy, California farmers are increasingly tech-minded, running their fields from iPads and tracking soil moisture and nitrogen levels with cloud software programs, and they are hungry for more tech solutions that will bolster their land's productivity and their bank balance.

"He was a weird little kid," said Kubiak, now 62 and retired. "I saw a lot of him in me. That thirst for knowledge … he's one of those kids that could either be CEO of a company or head of a gang."

LOS ANGELES — Help wanted: At least 130 veteran military aviators for nine-year commitment to fly fighter jets.

That's the offer from the Pentagon, which is so short of Air Force fighter pilots that it's boosting its salary package to make the job more enticing.

Several factors are behind the exodus of pilots, officials said, including a surge in demand for better-paying commercial pilots, the stresses of deployments and reassignments to fly combat [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), the remote-controlled technology that has reshaped modern warfare.

As a result, the Air Force is offering a souped-up incentive package under something called the Aviator Retention Program, which was first rolled out in 1989. The program now offers a $25,000 signing bonus per year for nine years — nearly twice as long as the usual contract.

The Air Force wants to get as many of the 200 to 250 eligible fighter pilots to take the deal. Some already have signed on.

Today, just 65 percent of pilots are deciding to extend their service past their 11th year, when they choose whether to stay for an additional five years. That's compared with 80 percent in 1993.

Air Force pilots typically earn about $90,000 by the time they complete their 11th year. The median annual wage of airline pilots, copilots and flight engineers is $103,210, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest numbers.

Dennis Prokopowicz, an assistant system chief pilot with Jet Blue Airways, said it will be difficult for civilian pilots to achieve that many hours, but much easier for military pilots.

"Getting that kind of experience for a civilian pilot is hard to come by," he said. "Renting a Cessna can cost around $100 per hour. You don't have to pay for that in the Air Force."

Prokopowicz spent 20 years flying fighter jets and attack planes in the Air Force across the globe, including Germany, Italy and South Korea, before he decided to leave.

But many decide to leave well before 20 years. The Air Force said part of the problem is finding and training new pilots. The shortage of veteran pilots has resulted in a lack of trainers.

Another logistics problem has emerged with the proliferation of drones, and the need for drone pilots. Drones went from being a handful of aircraft on Sept. 11 to the "fastest growing part of the force," said Peter W. Singer, author of "Wired for War," a book about robotic warfare.

SEATTLE — Steve Osmek is standing next to a tangle of shrubs and wildflowers, talking about conservation. But every 45 seconds or so, a jet rumbles overhead — drowning out all his words.

He's used to the planes by now. As the resident wildlife biologist at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Osmek is in charge of making sure animals play nice with the planes. "If it moves, if it has legs, I'm responsible," he says.

Sometimes, it's simply a matter of keeping animals out, like the 12-foot fence that prevents coyotes and deer from wandering onto the runways. But it's more complicated for the airport's greatest wildlife hazard: birds.

Bird strikes cost the U.S. aviation industry $700 million annually, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, and more than 200 people have died as a result of bird-plane collisions in the past quarter-century worldwide. When a flight taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport lost engine power after hitting a flock of geese but landed safely in the river in 2009, it was called "Miracle on the Hudson" for good reason. Sea-Tac had an emergency landing of its own in 2002, when a Boeing 737 struck 26 birds.

Sea-Tac was the first airport to hire a wildlife biologist, in the 1970s. Only a handful of airports across the country have wildlife biologists on staff, though most contract such positions out to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.

Susan Snow, an archaeologist for San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, said the site in Texas represents "the very essence of the great melting pot of the United States."

The best known of the missions, The Alamo, was the site of the famous 1836 battle when an outnumbered band of Texas settlers staged a courageous stand before Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna and his Mexican forces seized the mission. During the Battle of San Jacinto weeks later, then-victorious Texas soldiers shouted, "Remember the Alamo!"

LONDON — British actor Alan Rickman, a classically trained stage star and sensual screen villain in the "Harry Potter" saga and other films, has died. He was 69.

"You remind why we're all here, what we work for every day and why I am probably the most blessed person in the world to be at EPA at this time," said Gina McCarthy, who became administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency just last month.

"I intend to make you proud in the position the president has given me," she said to a standing ovation in the packed gymnasium at a Dillingham school.

McCarthy visited the Bristol Bay region this week as a nationwide debate grows over the proposed mine. It could be the largest open-pit mine in North America and is in a region that produces half the world's wild red salmon.

The area of the mine is a massive green expanse bursting with lakes and streams, a sweeping land of moose, caribou and grizzly bears surrounded by mountains.

A tiny camp, just a dot in the huge expanse of Alaskan wilderness, is the only evidence of what could become one of the world's biggest mining operations.

Traditional foods that can be obtained commercially, such as corn and bison, already have been served in some facilities, but the new law will allow access to a wider selection of foods, including game like venison, moose and caribou.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Many middle school students in south-central Alaska spent spring break playing video games, skiing in what little snow has fallen or just enjoying a lazy week away from school. Grayson Davey, an eighth-grader, spent most of his week off looking for employees.

Grayson said he doesn't think enough people follow both their dreams, and their ideas.

A January 2013 study on sediment cores from lakes near Alberta oil sand mines showed "a consistent story of increased contaminants and ecological change," says Joshua Kurek, a postdoctoral fellow at Queen's University in Ontario and lead author of the study. "Today our study lakes are very different compared to 50 years ago, and are on a path of unprecedented change."

QINGDAO, China — As far as Li Lejun is concerned, there's one easy way to make a July beach vacation even better than expected: Add seaweed. Hundreds upon hundreds of tons of it.

Buried up to his thighs in sand, his back covered in what looked like strands of chartreuse cotton candy, the 7-year-old Beijing boy was having the time of his life Sunday at No. 1 Bathing Beach in this city 350 miles north of Shanghai.

Ten paces to his right, men in swim briefs were using pitchforks to fling mounds of algae into a yellow front-end loader. In the other direction, a backhoe was scooping great piles of it into dump trucks. On Saturday, Lejun and his 69-year-old grandpa had helped gather globs of it from the sea, plopping it into plastic bags with other volunteers.

For at least the sixth year running, a giant algae bloom has engulfed the waters around this city like a bright green shag carpet mutating uncontrollably. This year's seaweed mass has been measured at about 11,500 square miles. Onshore winds help bring the strands ashore overnight, with some beaches buried under 16 inches of the flosslike flora, known to scientists as Ulva prolifera.

In general, the plant poses no danger to humans and intrepid beachgoers have been frolicking in the green seas, lounging on plushy-looking green beds of the material on shore, even burying themselves in big green haystacks of the stuff, which is helping Qingdao live up to its name, which means "Green Island."

It's wise for Qingdao officials to clear the beaches daily because left unattended, the seaweed can rot and give off toxic hydrogen sulfide fumes, Nelson said. In 2009, a Frenchman riding his horse encountered mounds of the foul plant material along the Brittany coast; both man and beast were overcome by the gas, and the horse died.

Large algae blooms can also pose a hazard to sea plants and animals if the layer of growth becomes thick enough and dense enough to steal oxygen from patches of ocean, Nelson said.

Conditions for the algae growth are ideal, with water temperatures about 68 degrees. Once temperatures rise to about 73, the algae will sink or begin to die off naturally, Liu and others said.

The state that started a trend by making high school students tackle algebra II is now abandoning the policy in a move praised by school districts for affording more flexibility. But some policy experts are nervous because nearly 20 states have followed Texas' lead in requiring the vigorous course.

Texas' about-face came after strong pressure from Jobs for Texas, a coalition of 22 industry trade groups that argued the state's curriculum was too rigid and no longer met the needs of the modern workforce.

A new study that examined certain swimming species' motion in the ocean found a surprising and elegant ratio embedded in the way they move. This ratio, described in the journal PLOS Biology, reveals a surprising case of convergent evolution over a diverse array of unrelated animals — and could help engineers build better swimming robots.

When it comes to conservation efforts, few regions of the Earth have garnered as much attention as the Amazon. Considering that it's home to the world's largest remaining rain forest and some of the highest levels of biodiversity on the planet, halting deforestation in the Amazon basin has been a major priority of environmentalists around the globe. But while preserving the trees is undoubtedly important, there's another equally significant, but often less talked-about aspect of the Amazon that scientists believe is in trouble.

"I wonder often how long will we have to pay for crimes that we haven't committed. I immediately began to dread the hate crimes that were sure to follow," said Abdelhamid, 25, who works for a Washington-based refugee agency.

But it was only while scouring the Internet a few years ago that he began to unravel the true drama that had unfolded — oddly enough, when he read a newspaper article about Richard Nixon's post-presidency search for a New York home. As it happened, Nixon purchased his exclusive Upper East Side townhouse from Lester Tanner, a prominent New York lawyer who mentioned in passing how Edmonds had saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.

With all the camp's inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks, the German commander turned to Edmonds and said: "They cannot all be Jews." To which Edmonds replied: "We are all Jews here."

But prior to Edmonds, only four were Americans, and they all belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups. Edmonds is the first serviceman and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow Americans. A ceremony for Edmonds is planned for next year. And, thanks to his son's efforts, Edmonds is now also being considered for a Congressional Medal of Honor.

Chris Edmonds, who leads a Baptist congregation in Maryville, Tennessee, said he believed his father had a "deep moral conviction" instilled in his faith that inspired his actions.

"He was fading out, we were going to lose him," said his father, Amos Glick, who is Old Order Amish and runs a foundry in Chester County.

Doctors at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia sent the family to the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg. For years, the site had been refining an unusual specialty: treating Amish and Mennonite children with rare genetic disorders.

BALTIMORE—Some of springtime's more notable heralds appear to be fading away, as a new study finds frogs, toads and salamanders disappearing at an alarming rate across the United States.

But Scott Stranko, a DNR biologist who oversees an ongoing statewide survey of Maryland streams, said it has tracked declines in some of the salamanders more sensitive to disturbances in landscape or water quality.

"Basically, they die of thirst in an aquatic environment," Snodgrass said.
The largest category of reports, about 18 percent, was related to motion sickness, including fainting, nausea and dizziness. Back and neck pain ranked second, at 16 percent, followed by head injuries at 12 percent.

Combined, parks reported an average of about 350 injuries a year during the six-year period, while combined total attendance at Southern California's largest parks was estimated to exceed 40 million visitors a year.

Three men died after riding attractions at Southern California theme parks during the period. Medical examiners concluded that serious, pre-existing medical conditions were the likely causes of two of the deaths. The third was undetermined, but the coroner found that the man had a heart condition and had suffered a brain hemorrhage.

"We are at the top of the (injury) list because we are the top of the list for attendance," said Greg Hale, chief safety officer for Disney's theme parks.

After riding Space Mountain on May 13, 2012, with her husband and two children, Joan Brown, a 49-year-old mortgage underwriter from Santa Barbara, Calif., said she suffered memory loss and headaches.

When she got off the ride, she kept asking, "Where are we going?" said her husband, Scott Bell. Neurological tests determined she suffered from global amnesia, he said. Brown stayed home from work for three weeks with severe headaches and still remembers little about that day at Disneyland, he said.

Space Mountain's age may also be a factor; the coaster opened in 1977. The state's injury reports suggest that older rides generate more injuries than newer ones. Among the 10 attractions with the most injuries, six are at least 20 years old. Only one — the Tower of Terror drop ride at Disney California Adventure Park — was built in the last decade.

"Harnesses, security and safety on rides are much more advanced today than they were 30 or 40 years ago," said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services, an Ohio-based consultant to the industry.

Scientists think the ship was a merchant vessel that foundered around 60 B.C.

"She was an extraordinary, charismatic person," Edwin Wilson, a former provost at Wake Forest University where Angelou taught, told The Charlotte Observer years ago. "She had a way of bringing an audience very much to within her grasp."

After Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he asked her to read a poem at his inauguration, the first poem at an inauguration in 32 years.

She called it "On the Pulse of the Morning," and in it she spoke of hope for the country's future, but also reminded listeners of two despairs from the past: the Trail of Tears and slavery.

Early in her writing career, she began renting hotel rooms where she would write. She would take a yellow pad, a dictionary, a thesaurus, a Bible and a bottle of sherry.

LONDON — Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden suggest that spy agencies have a powerful ally in "Angry Birds" and a host of other apps installed on smartphones across the globe.

"Watch Me Move: The Animation Show," which organizers call the "most extensive animation show ever mounted," has both iconic clips — featuring the aforementioned Mouse, Simpson and Bunny — as well as lesser-known works that span the past 100-plus years. The show brings together industry pioneers, independent filmmakers and contemporary artists, including William Kentridge and Nathalie Djurberg, alongside commercial studios such as Walt Disney, Aardman and Pixar.

"Big Hero 6" has been a critical and commercial hit for Walt Disney Animation Studios, winning an Oscar and taking in more than $500 million at the box office.

Computer-animated films are big business: In most years, a handful rank among the top 10 U.S. box-office hits. They can also generate toys, clothes and other products that can produce big profits.

Disney Animation's "Frozen" grossed more than $1 billion and has bolstered profits for several business units of the studio's parent, Burbank-based Walt Disney Co.

Now, scientists have peered into the heart of such fire-ant rafts and discovered how the individual insects link together to create these remarkably strong yet lightweight structures. Such insight, described in a paper in the Journal of Experimental Biology, may one day help engineers build self-healing buildings and bridges.

The towers, bridges and boats that ants build are remarkable in part because they're strong and light and they adapt to their surroundings, and because ants are both the construction workers and the raw materials. Ants use their bodies like the beams in a building; instead of screwing or nailing those beams together, they reach out and touch each other.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140513_ANTARCTICA_ICE.jpg" />A slow-motion and irreversible collapse of a massive cluster of glaciers in Antarctica has begun, and could cause sea levels to rise across the planet by another 4 feet within 200 years, scientists concluded in two studies released Monday.

The Pentagon is poised to spend billions to build a new stealth bomber, a top secret project that could bring hundreds of jobs to the wind-swept desert communities in Los Angeles County's northern reaches.

But that does require remembering the words, which pop star Christina Aguilera did not do successfully at the beginning of Super Bowl XLV in February 2011. Others also have flubbed the lyrics or the tune, though this year there was relief all over social media that Super Bowl XLVIII organizers brought in an opera superstar, soprano Renee Fleming, to do the honors. As BuzzFeed put it, "She absolutely killed it."

In fact, rapid development of technology, swelling population and growing consumption of resources from crops to metals have expanded humanity's impacts, particularly after 1950 or so, an inflection point some have dubbed the "Great Acceleration." People have created long-lasting new materials, ranging from copper alloys to plastics that will form long-lived, so-called "technofossils." Enough concrete has been made by now to cover every square meter of the world in a kilogram of the building material. Sufficient plastic is currently manufactured each year to weigh as much as all 7 billion–plus humans on the planet. People move nearly three times as much rock and dirt via mining than the amount that travels with water through all the world's rivers. Modern chemistry has even liberated civilization from the natural nitrogen cycle that has prevailed for the last 2.5 billion years. And tiny soot particles left over after burning coal, oil and natural gas now can be found in sediments from tropical lakes to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, a permanent smudge on the geologic record.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — A popular and accomplished Los Altos High student received a parent's text message at school last year, to come home to talk about her grades. The student and star athlete had earned all A's — except one D. She asked to be excused from English class to go to the bathroom, but she never returned. She had collapsed, suffering a disabling emotional breakdown.

Overfelt High on San Jose, California's East Side has seen a spike in student panic attacks. Anxiety disorder rose this past fall among teens in nearby schools as well.

"We are seeing children who are coming in with greater needs around mental health, and also seeing them at an earlier age," said Judith Cameron of the San Ramon Valley Unified School District.

Not all schools have reported an increase in mental illness. But not every school has staff attentive to each student's well-being, nor do they have therapists and psychologists at hand.

"They're not expected to be great; they're expected to be stupendous," said Cristy Dawson, assistant principal at Los Altos High, about the ultracompetitive college-going culture. "This valley is all about getting ahead."

Sometimes, anxiety grows into phobias. "Kids are so depressed or anxious, they're not getting out of bed; they're becoming agoraphobic," afraid to appear in public, said Helen Hsu, a supervisor at the city of Fremont's Youth and Family Services, which provides therapists to several schools.

ORLANDO — Kyana Julian took her first Advanced Placement course — human geography — during her freshman year at Orlando's University High School. Her counselor, she said, told her taking tough courses was a must if she wanted to get into a good college.

NEW YORK — Apple is turning its retail stores into art galleries featuring the work of professional photographers and other artists who use iPads, iPhones and Mac computers to create.

CUPERTINO, Calif.  — Apple is buying more flair, swagger and song-picking savvy with its $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, a headphone and music streaming specialist founded by rapper Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, one of the first recording executives to roll with the hip-hop culture.

The growing popularity of music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify has been reducing sales of songs and albums, a business that iTunes has dominated for the past decade. U.S. sales of downloaded songs slipped 1 percent last year to $2.8 billion while streaming music revenue surged 39 percent to $1.4 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

EXCELSIOR, Minn. — On a crisp late fall afternoon, David Bedford plucks an apple from a young tree, chomps into the fruit and chews thoughtfully.

"Perfectly good. Not excellent. Not a wow." He tosses the apple to the ground, and renders his verdict with spray paint, a stripe of orange down the trunk that tells the orchard crew to take it down. "You're going to the firewood farm," he tells the tree, with a wry grin that creases the smile lines framing his planed cheekbones and salt-and-pepper goatee.

Bedford, mild-mannered and even-tempered, is ruthless in his quest to produce the next great apple.

As research scientist for the U's apple-breeding program, Bedford tastes a lot of apples. About 500 to 600 a day, every day, during peak apple season, until his gums hurt.

Apple Inc. has begun pressuring the major record companies to offer new releases exclusively through its iTunes store — a move that would initially block availability on streaming services such as Spotify or Beats Music, according to several people familiar with the matter.

"I almost choked," she said in an interview. "It was shocking."

GENEVA, N.Y. — Trees at Cornell University's research orchard this fall are heavy with waxy apples, deep-red, round apples, oblong apples and aromatic apples that smell like autumn.

The thousands of trees here are tended for a single goal: to grow apples with just the right mix of sweetness, tart and crunch.

Brown, a Cornell professor of agriculture who has been breeding apples since 1990, walked through the apple-dappled rows on a sunny day this week offering test chomps. One apple was juicy but mushy, another exceptionally firm and crisp.

NEWPORT NEWS, Va. — Using fish to make fertilizer isn't a new concept. But John Morris has modernized the process through a sophisticated farming operation called aquaponics.

Laidre was the lead author on a recent paper in Conservation Biology that explored the conservation status of Arctic marine mammals in light of the increasing effects of climate change in the region. The paper touches on the potential for increased movement of animals in the Arctic - and many of the species discussed in that paper also appear in McKeon's new paper, where he and his colleagues have compiled a list of marine mammals and birds that they expect will move increasingly between the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins in the future.

It's not just craters purportedly dug by space aliens in Russia, it's also megaslumps, ice that burns and drunken trees. The ongoing meltdown of the permanently frozen ground that covers nearly a quarter of land in the Northern Hemisphere has caused a host of surprising arctic phenomena.

The mysterious craters in far northern Russia are just such an example. "There is nothing described in the scientific literature that can really, fully explain those craters," says Grosse, who is headed to the Lena River Delta in Siberia this summer, which hosts a joint German-Russian research station. The most likely explanation for the newly discovered craters in Russia is an accumulation of methane over centuries or more that then burst out of the thawing ground sometime in the last few years. "High pressure built up and [the ground] literally popped open," explains biogeochemist Kevin Schaefer of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. "If it is indeed caused by melting methane ice, we should expect to see more."

The chance encounter of a Norwegian research vessel with the largest waves ever recorded amid floating packs of Arctic ice shows how such rollers could reroute shipping, damage oil platforms and threaten coastal communities with erosion. In a March report in Geophysical Research Letters, scientists at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) describe how large waves can penetrate more deeply into ice cover and break it up faster and more completely than anyone had suspected.

Every year Aleksey Marchenko of The University Center in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago north of Scandinavia, leads students across the chilly waters of the Barents Sea to study the seasonal ice pack. Near its edges pack ice is composed of pieces loosely drifting on the water. Farther inside the pack there are kilometers-wide chunks that have been blown together into a nearly solid mass. Toughened ships like Marchenko's converted Arctic fishing vessel, the RV Lance, can usually pick their way slowly through it. When the Lance left port in May 2010, Marchenko was expecting two or three days of leisurely fieldwork. In previous years the group had even camped out on large floes.

The Lance sailed east and around 80 kilometers from the small island of Hopen moored next to a large expanse of pack ice on May 2. Marchenko prepared to lead his class out onto the floe. "We were ready to go but when I went out, I discovered many cracks around," he remembers. He decided to move the Lance deeper into the pack for safety. As he did so, the ship encountered small waves that grew in size over time — a surprise as even a little ice near the pack edges usually damps out waves. These waves then rapidly broke up the ice around the ship into thousands of smaller pieces.

Collins does not expect the record waves of 2010 to stand for long. As the ice-breaking feedback loop accelerates in years to come, more and more towering waves are likely to batter the shrinking ice cap. For the Arctic Ocean, there are stormy times ahead.
Victor Brabble, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Tucson, said the Border Patrol and other immigration agents urged residents to be careful when providing humanitarian aid.

"We do have a common goal, which is to reduce victimization of border crossers from hazards of the desert," Brabble said.

In 2005, Arivaca became a focal point for U.S. immigration policy as tensions between aid groups and Border Patrol agents reached a peak. That's when Daniel Strauss and Shanti Sellz, humanitarian aid volunteers, were arrested on suspicion of smuggling after they put three dehydrated men in their car to be taken to a hospital in Tucson. A district court judge dismissed the case a year later.

Two years ago, a federal appeals court overturned a littering conviction against Daniel Millis, a humanitarian aid volunteer who left gallon-sized bottles of water for border crossers in Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, near Arivaca.

Since then, federal officials have backed off trying to prosecute humanitarian aid workers, said James Duff Lyall, an American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona staff attorney based in Tucson.

The school patrol plan has its critics. Some wonder about the background of the volunteers and if they can be trusted. The posse includes military veterans and former police officers. However, a local television news investigation revealed that some posse members have criminal records, including assault and disorderly conduct charges.

Instead, the NRA has called for armed police officers in every school in the nation. A new ad by the group aims to persuade the public to oppose Obama's plan. It asks, "Are the president's kids more important than yours? Then why is he skeptical about putting armed security in our schools when his kids are protected by armed guards at their school."

RALEIGH, N.C. — A ready-to-eat Army meal can survive a 1,200-foot parachute drop and stay fresh for up to three years — only to go straight into the trash can if it doesn't appeal to a soldier's taste.

That's a problem researchers at North Carolina State University are hoping to solve by infusing snack bars and other prepared foods with extracts from tasty fruits and vegetables grown in North Carolina.

Using a $60,000 grant from the Center for Advanced Processing and Packaging Studies, an organization that links industries and university researchers, Lila and her colleagues chose one fruit and one vegetable to test their new method of extracting and transplanting vital nutrients.

That changed in April when the Army issued sweeping changes in how women in uniform can wear their hair, along with new regulations about tattoos.

The rules specifically ban certain hairstyles, including twists, large cornrow braids and dreadlocks, popular among black women. And that hit a nerve already tenderized by generations of debate within the black community over what constitutes "good" or "bad" hair.

The policy outlaws tattoos on the face, neck, lower arms and hands. It also bans some women's hairstyles not associated with a particular racial or ethnic group, such as angled cuts in which one section of hair is dramatically longer than the rest.

There is now a $5 million reward out for any tips that might help bring the artworks home. "You don't have to hand us the paintings to be eligible for the reward," said Anthony Amore, the museum security chief.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Inside the gallery, artworks by Syrian artists were drawing auction bids from collectors. Outside on the street, the artists traded the latest gossip from Syria and checked their smartphones for news from the civil war.

So goes the divided world for a cadre of Syrian artists brought to the safety of Dubai by their gallery to continue their work but still remain deeply connected and influenced by the bloodshed they left behind.

The Syrian refugee diaspora — now at 2 million and growing — has fanned out across the region and beyond for more than two years from tent camps in Jordan to others trying to rebuild lives in cities such as Beirut and Istanbul. But the Gulf states present a paradox: Deeply involved in the war as some of the strongest backers for the Syrian rebels yet holding firm to tight entry controls that effectively block most refugees.

The auction Monday in Dubai's evolving art district — tucked inside an industrial zone of warehouses and businesses — served as a window into a small but forward-looking effort to save one niche of Syria's artistic community with no end in sight to the civil war that has already claimed more than 100,000 lives.

But conflict has always been an incubator for creativity: The political cartoons of the American and French revolutions in the 18th century, the powerful canvases inspired by the 1930s Spanish Civil War such as Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso)'s "Guernica," and now the Web-driven protest art of Middle East uprisings.

However, early fossils of arthropods are hard to come by, which made this particular find so exciting.

"If you have the right sediments and they react with the right decay products, then you can basically turn soft tissues to stone," he said. "But a very specific set of criteria must be met, so sites like this are extremely rare."

WASHINGTON — Delivering a forceful argument on the role of the arts in education, Michelle Obama said Tuesday that it isn't something to be introduced after student test scores go up but is a critical element of achieving those higher test scores in the first place.

From an astronomical observatory on Chews Ridge in the Santa Lucia Mountains, the University of California, Davis atmospheric scientist has for the last three years measured ozone, the lung-damaging gas in smog, as it arrives to California. The monitoring site, more than 5,000 feet above sea level on a pine-studded overlook above the lowest layer of the atmosphere, gives Faloona access to undisturbed air from across the Pacific before it is fouled by U.S. pollution sources.

He and other scientists at rural, high-altitude sites across the western U.S. have been documenting rising levels of ozone, which can trigger asthma attacks, worsen heart and lung disease and lead to premature deaths, even as emissions have plummeted nationwide over the last few decades.

WASHINGTON — The Freer Gallery of Art in Washington hopes to save Asian artworks for future generations. But first, it has to save Grace Jan's job.

WASHINGTON — In a major shift in immigration patterns over the next 50 years, Asians will have surged past Hispanics to become the largest group of immigrants heading to the United States, according to estimates in a new immigration study.

WASHINGTON — Back home in Bangkok, Pranee Wilcox worked as an accountant for Thailand's Ministry of Defense. But even with a bachelor's degree, the divorced mother of two struggled. So in 2001, when the Thai ambassador offered her a job as his housekeeper in the Washington, D.C., embassy, she said yes — even though that meant leaving her babies behind. She figured she'd make much more money working abroad.

Four years later, when the ambassador returned to Thailand, Wilcox decided to stay, although that meant living in the United States without papers and with very little English. Desperate for money, she said she worked 12-hour days, six days a week, first as a cook, then as a nail technician, so she could send money back to her family.

"I still feel like I'm not a success yet," said Wilcox, 44, taking a break from her mani-pedi duties at a D.C. salon. She said her goal is to become a U.S. citizen.

Over the past decade, Asians and Pacific Islanders have become the fastest-growing group to enter the United States, outpacing Latinos. And new data from the Pew Research Center show they are projected to become the biggest immigrant group by 2055. (Pew also funds Stateline.)

SAN JOSE, Calif. — In an era when U.S. airline accidents are rare, the crash landing of Asiana Flight 214 has given two decades of safety improvements a chance to demonstrate its worth.

As tragic as the loss of three young lives in the crash is, 304 people lived — a 99 percent survival rate.

"The tremendous safety enhancements that have been made over the past 30 years were put into play in this tragic event," said Larry Rooney, executive vice president of the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, a trade association of professional pilots. "It was a tragic loss of life but nowhere near what you would have anticipated."

Among the safety features that helped so many passengers survive: stronger, fireproof seats; fire retardant materials inside the cabin and around the cargo areas; illuminated strips on the floor leading to the exits, and training of flight attendants to speak up — and pilots to pay attention — when they notice something wrong.

The Boeing 777 that crashed July 6 has a record "of being one of the safest airliners in the sky," said Kevin Hiatt, president and chief executive officer of the Flight Safety Foundation.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Scheming to rearrange the heavens, scientists are busy planning how to pluck, push and park a spinning asteroid between here and the moon.

While most of us hope to dodge space rocks, NASA has unveiled an ambitious, $105 million plan to build a spaceship to drag one closer to Earth. It's the Space Age equivalent of bringing the mountain to Muhammad and a first step in our future voyage to Mars.

After finding a suitable space rock orbiting our way, the spaceship might push, tug or harpoon the asteroid. Or it might stuff the rock into a big bag, or perhaps lasso it in some 21st century version of a Roy Rogers rope trick.

SAN JOSE, Calif. — With nothing less at stake than the future of planet Earth, NASA has decided to crowdsource ideas to detect and track asteroids that have the potential to wipe out life as we know it.

After a previously undetected, 65-foot-wide asteroid exploded over Russia in February 2013, unleashing the force of 500,000 tons of TNT, NASA launched a series of contests for smart folks around the globe to come up with ways to keep an eye on asteroids that could threaten Earth.

Currently, NASA estimates that only 1 percent of the millions of asteroids hurtling around our solar system have been found.

So NASA calls the series of contests that make up the Asteroid Grand Challenge "a broad call to action" to defend Earth against any number of asteroids that could be bearing down on us right this instant.

PHILADELPHIA — The astronaut Scott Kelly is about to take off for the International Space Station, and if he is like some space travelers, he may temporarily feel a bit foggy or disoriented once in orbit.

Scientists have not had much luck measuring this subtle effect with standard cognitive tests, but now, a group of University of Pennsylvania researchers is trying a new tack.

Most of the crowd left the landfill before the discovery, turned away by strong winds that kicked up massive clouds of dust mingled with garbage. By the time the games were found, only a few dozen people remained. Some were playing the infamous game in a make-shift gaming den with a TV and an 1980's game console in the back of a van, while others took selfies beside a life-size E.T. doll inside a DeLorean car like the one that was turned into a time machine in the "Back To The Future" movies.

Tina Amini, deputy editor at gaming website Kotaku, said the game tanked because "it was practically broken." A recurring flaw, she said, was that the character of the game, the beloved extraterrestrial, would fall into traps that were almost impossible to escape and would appear constantly and unpredictably.

"As an athletic trainer, we're usually right there with the student-athletes during some of their worst moments," Timothy Neal, chair of the task force and assistant director of athletics for sports medicine at Syracuse University in New York, said. "You have their trust."

About 30 percent of college-aged people reported having some type of mental illness during 2010 and 2011, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

She recently spoke in Dallas about the brain science behind golf and the yips at the Center for BrainHealth's public lecture series at the University of Texas at Dallas.

A small number of golfers who come down with the yips have focal dystonia, or a neurological problem in the brain that causes involuntary muscle contractions, says Crews. For most, there's nothing neurologically wrong. This is what makes the yips so mysterious. Except for the spasm itself, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with these golfers.

Castro first experienced the yips more than 10 years ago. He had played golf since he was 6 and was especially active in high school, but when he went to college, he stopped playing so frequently. That's when he first experienced the yips.

This is similar to a treatment for focal dystonia when writing. Place paper on the desk, and people with focal dystonia can't write. Place it on the wall, though, and all of a sudden, they can.

"People think they've got to do this one perfect motion this one way, but that's not true," Crews says. "There's many ways."

Prosecutors said Hall's rigorous accountability measures — stronger than federal objectives under the No Child Left Behind Act — demanded ever-increasing and unrealistic test scores. As scores rose, she garnered national accolades, but the governor's report says teachers suffered under her administration. The report said the system was primed for cheating by the severe consequences meted out for failure, including firings, demotions and public humiliation.

Dajani said the idea of taking students to Auschwitz took shape after he made a journey to the site three years ago on a visit sponsored by The Aladdin Project, a Paris-based organization that promotes understanding between Muslims and Jews.

LOS ANGELES – Children with autism spectrum disorders usually aren't diagnosed until they are at least 2 years old, but a new study finds that signs of the condition are apparent as early as two months after birth.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — In the year and a half or so since a group of Kansas City-area students in a school district engineering program helped bring it to fruition, the Sensory Lounger has enjoyed quite a run.

The Harps, from Gaithersburg, Maryland, were one of 50 families participating on a recent Saturday afternoon in The Arc of Baltimore's Wings for Autism, which provides children with developmental disabilities with a dry run of the process of boarding a plane.

Bishop went to BWI with her friend Mark Cates and her son, Nathaniel Epstein, 14. Nathaniel had been on a plane once before — 10 years ago. The trip was disastrous, and Bishop promised herself she'd never fly with Nathaniel again.

Because children with autism who are nonverbal cannot talk, the thoughts occupying their heads are unable to come out — that's where the iPad comes in. Through the application of their choice, the children can form sentences by putting together words, which come in the form of buttons and a picture to match the word. Then, they play it back for others to hear. The iPad becomes their voice.

"It facilitates their understanding of the world around them," says Danielle Skala, a functional communication classroom teacher at Forest North Elementary in the Round Rock Independent School District. She has a few students who use iPads in her classroom.

Zach's Voice was founded by Abby Whitworth, who named the organization after her 7-year-old son. Whitworth was inspired by Zach's initial interaction with the iPad. Prior to the Apple product, he used DynaVox, a heavy device that was hard to program, Whitworth said. Besides being clunky, it also drew attention to him. With an iPad, however, he blends in.

The application recommended by Zach's Voice is ProLoQuo2Go, which costs $219.99 at the iTunes store. The organization provides its recipients with a gift card that covers the cost of whatever app they decide to download. Jaime chose Lamp Words for Life, the program he had been using with his therapist.

ProLoQuo2Go lets its users add words to the program, such as family members' names and their favorite cartoon characters. Adding a button is instantaneous, and kids can customize them by taking a picture of the word they add.

Data entry is repetitive and hard to do well; that is, quickly and accurately. Shane Foley is great at it.

The 21-year-old Ellicott City, Maryland, man works on two computer screens, eyeing images of handwritten sheets on one and clicking the information into a program on the other. His boss gives him a glowing review. So does the head of the state agency whose contract he is working on.

"We're very much believers in the abilities of all peoples with disabilities, and like to focus on what people can do," said Catherine Raggio, secretary of the Maryland Department of Disabilities.

She got the ball rolling for the program, dubbed Aspire, but it is not state-run. Instead, it operates as a staffing agency through PDG Inc., a company that specializes in services for people with disabilities. PDG hired Foley in November, trained him, and got him started on contract work for the state Department of Juvenile Services.

Sam Abed, Maryland's secretary of juvenile services, is an enthusiastic supporter of the program, thanks to Foley's near-flawless data entry. In five months, he has made a single mistake. And that was at the very beginning.

"We have people who could do it but weren't doing as good a job as this young man is doing," Abed said. "It just really fills the need for us in a great way."

Health officials refer to the "spectrum" of autism because its symptoms vary widely. Autistic disorder, so-called classic autism, often causes substantial language delays as well as social and communication challenges. Those with Asperger's typically do not have language problems, and their IQ is normal or above average. But they find social situations a never-ending challenge. Picking up on body-language cues, for instance, or making friends can be difficult.

Shanna Pool, assistant principal of Kennedy Krieger Institute's special-education high school in Baltimore, said tech jobs can be a good fit for people with autism or Asperger's.

"It's not necessary to read emotions when they're working on computers, or social cues," she said. "It's more concrete, straightforward and logical, and generally their thinking is concrete, straightforward and logical."

Julie Foley, Shane's mother, said her son prepared for a data-entry job, taking IT classes in school and doing data entry in a work-study program. The family found out about the Aspire program by chance -- the Howard County, Md., school system's director of special education heard about it and immediately thought of the Foleys.

Frankie, 14, and Lauren, 17, shared their idea with adminstrators and teachers at the Kennedy Krieger School for children with developmental disabilities in Rockville, Maryland, where their siblings are students. Then they recruited their friends to help and divvied up responsibilities: Frankie and her team from Georgetown Day School in Washington would work to prepare the students at Kennedy Krieger for the event, and then Lauren and friends, who attend Albert Einstein High School in Kensington, Maryland, would jump in to help out and co-host on the day of the prom.

Ford's Western hub, opened in January, is just one sign of California's emergence as the global center for the future of personal mobility. Other automotive powerhouses with Valley offices include Toyota, Honda, Hyundai, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan and automotive suppliers Continental, Delphi and Denso.

It's a lot more complicated than selling picks and shovels to gold miners, but the idea's the same. As airplane manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, as well as their emerging challengers, charge into a new world where wings and jet bodies are built from carbon-fiber composites rather than metal, only a few suppliers can provide the key tools they all need.

Then, in a mesmerizing industrial dance, the head moves back and forth, laying down shorter and longer strips of fiber, each heated to a fiery glow at the point of application, while the surface to be covered rotates as needed.

As it zipped around during the demo, the machine's readout showed a top speed of 595 pounds of carbon fiber laid down per hour.

That is "a very large number, probably the fastest we've seen," said Jeff Sloan, editor-in-chief of the trade magazine High Performance Composites. In current real-world applications, an average lay-down speed of 90 pounds per hour would be fast, he said.

Bill Hasenjaeger, product marketing manager with CGTech, of Irvine, Calif., which makes the software for AFP technology, said reliable precision — which he's seen in previous Electroimpact AFP machines — is more important than top speed.

Ben Hempstead, chief of staff at Electroimpact, insists the company's AFP technology can't be matched by competitors.

"You won't see this anywhere else on the planet," Hempstead said.

MEXICO CITY — A Mexican archaeologist said his team has found a tunnel-like passageway that apparently leads to two sealed chambers, the latest chapter in the search for the as-yet undiscovered tomb of an Aztec ruler.

The Aztecs are believed to have cremated the remains of their leaders during their 1325-1521 rule, but the final resting place of the cremains has never been found. Outside experts said Tuesday the find at Mexico City's Templo Mayor ruin complex would be significant.

The mouth of the tunnel was sealed by a 3-ton slab of rock. When experts lifted it in 2013, they found a hollow space marked by offerings both rich and grisly.

But one researcher detected signs that a passageway appeared to lead deeper into the ceremonial platform, known as the Cuauhxicalco (kwow-she-KAL-koh), where written accounts from after the 1521 Spanish conquest indicated that rulers' remains were burned.

It would be a logical place for rulers remains to lie — the Templo Mayor site was the most significant temple complex in the Aztec capital, known as Tenochtitlan. But Mexican archaeologists have been searching in vain for the tombs for years.

In 2007, archaeologists using ground-penetrating radar detected underground chambers directly below a huge stone monolith carved with a representation of Tlaltecuhtli (tlahl-tay-KOO-tlee), the Aztec god of the earth. At the time, Lopez Lujan suspected an emperor's tomb might lie beneath, but none was found.

Any artifacts linked to an emperor would bring tremendous pride to Mexico. The country has sought unsuccessfully to recover Aztec artifacts like the feather-adorned "shield of Ahuizotl" and the "Montezuma headdress" from the Ethnology Museum in Vienna, Austria.

Dr. Michael E. Smith, a professor of anthropology at Arizona State University who was not involved in the dig, said: "Leonardo knows the archaeology and ethno-history better than anybody, and he is not one to grandstand or make fantastic claims to garner publicity. Thus I would think his prediction is reasonable."

Keeva is a baby chimpanzee, an adorable, sweet little girl born March 12 to a female chimp at the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore. Unfortunately, her mom, 26-year-old Carole, seemed ill-prepared for the responsibilities of motherhood. She wasn't hostile toward Keeva, wasn't trying to hurt her. Trouble was, she wasn't trying to do much of anything with her baby — she wasn't nursing her, wasn't bonding with her.

In fact, 13 percent of the parents who took the survey had not finished high school. Still, 77 percent of them said they had a smartphone, 83 percent had a tablet and 59 percent had Internet access.

Many of the infants and toddlers may have been poking randomly at their digital screens, but at least some of them were doing something purposeful, according to the parents.

Fifteen percent of the children had used an app before they turned 1, and 24 percent had called someone, the researchers reported. The most common age to start using apps was 2, when 36 percent of the children tried them. Likewise, 36 percent of the kids started playing video games when they were 2.

If the children enjoyed playing with the digital devices, the parents seemed to benefit too. Nearly two-thirds of the parents said they handed over their mobile media gadgets to calm their children, and 29 percent said they used them to get their children to sleep.

LOS ANGELES — Like his father and grandfather before him, butcher Lou DeRosa lifts thick slabs of bacon from the glass case at Marconda's Meats and wraps them for a waiting customer.

Tucked away at LA's landmark Farmers Market, the little butcher stand is selling more bacon than ever — and at prices that tip the scale toward "crazy," DeRosa said. The Danish bacon rings up at $8.98 a pound for America's trendiest meat.

The country's love affair with bacon is coming at an increasing cost. The price of the popular cured meat has risen at more than three times the rate of inflation since 2008, the most of any meat, according to government price trackers.

Contributing to soaring bacon prices is California's three-year drought, which made feed for pigs more expensive. In addition, an unprecedented virus has killed about 7 million piglets since 2013, trimming the nation's pork supply by almost 12 percent, said John Green, director of marketing for the National Pork Board.

"Our supply is static since it takes nine months to make a pig," Green said. "That's troublesome since the real drive in bacon right now is consumer demand."

In June, shoppers paid $6.11 on average for a pound of sliced bacon in grocery stores, a record high, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Four years earlier, the average price was $4.05 a pound.

At a Ralph's supermarket in Brentwood, James McMenamin, 27, considered nixing his bacon purchase after double-checking the price tag.

Despite the soaring prices, bacon sales climbed 9.5 percent to a record $4 billion in 2013, according to Information Resources Inc., a market research firm.

Bacon is deeply embedded in American culture and has taken on the status of comfort food, said Ari Weinzweig, author of "Zingerman's Guide to Better Bacon."

"There's an emotional attachment there," Weinzweig said. "It reminds us of childhood."

Americans are adding more bacon in more unorthodox places: in ice cream, sushi and sprinkled on chocolate chip cookies.

The salty meat can be found in the potato-bacon terrine at Wolfgang Puck's Beverly Hills restaurant, Spago, and in Denny's maple bacon milkshake.

Drivers ordering bacon-topped burgers at drive-through windows will pay nearly $5 on average, the unofficial ceiling on fast-food burgers, according to SpenDifference, a restaurant supply chain co-op in Denver. Its recent restaurant chain survey showed that 93 percent of the 60 chains interviewed planned to raise prices during the second half of this year.

"Most men want a woman who is good in the kitchen, but the German SS needed me because I could cook," he joked, not long before last Thursday's Holocaust Remembrance Day, his voice carrying an Eastern European lilt, with a prankster's playfulness. Then he turned serious: "Baking saved my life. If I wasn't a baker, I'd probably be dead."

EVANSTON, Ill. — Drew McDonough walks quickly past the 50-pound bags of brown sugar and the huge tubs of chocolate frosting. He takes a second to clock in at a computer, dresses in his bakery clothes (hairnet, work shirt, apron), and then speed-walks toward the stainless steel table where, five days a week, he packages cups of sticky toffee pudding.

When his boss inquires about his weekend, McDonough responds with brisk one-word answers and barely makes eye contact. But that is fine with Jean Kroll, owner of the Sugar & Spice Extraordinary Sweet Treats commercial bakery in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, who simply points her new hire toward the racks of golden brown cakes.

This past summer, McDonough and two other men with autism arrived at the bakery as part of a six-week unpaid internship. But there was one important twist: As the men learned to measure sugar and package cakes, a graduate student from the nearby Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management carefully tracked their productivity. The question: Did it make good business sense to hire someone with a disability?

For Kroll, a 50-year-old entrepreneur who had plowed her life savings into the bakery, that was a critical question.

The story of how — at the end of the internship — she offered paid positions to McDonough and two other men with autism is one of luck and goodwill. But it is also, according to Kroll, a story of a clear-eyed business decision.

"People always say, 'That's such a nice thing to do,'" said Kroll, referring to her decision to hire the men. "I say, 'Yes it is nice. But it's also a smart thing to do.'"

Two years ago, Kroll moved her commercial bakery into a 10,000-square-foot facility tucked in an industrial strip. A few doors down was a nonprofit called Have Dreams, which provides services to people with autism.

Voters in two Western states are caught in fierce battles over whether consumers will know what is deep inside their food.

Oregon and Colorado on Nov. 4 will decide the fate of labeling laws for genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, the latest fronts in a battle over packaging. Measure 92 in Oregon and Proposition 105 in Colorado call for labeling food so that purchasers know whether they are buying products that contain materials that have been genetically engineered or modified.

And in a clever public relations move, Ben &amp; Jerry's, the Vermont ice cream company and label supporter, renamed its popular Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor to Food Fight Fudge Brownie to draw attention to the ballot initiatives.
"It's a big part of why we come out here and do what we do," he said in an interview in the dugout before the game. "It's a shame that it's come to them not being able to come out and (enjoy) the game."

In late April, the then-26-year-old shot his Fuji X-T1 over and over again as demonstrators took to the streets to protest the death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a fatal injury in police custody. Marching alongside the protesters, Allen snapped portrait after portrait that offered a view from the front lines in the days after Gray's death.

Now, the cover photo — a shot of a solitary blurred figure running from a wall of police in riot gear near Camden Yards — is being blown up for Allen's first professional photography exhibit. "Awakenings, In a New Light" opens Friday at Lewis Now, the new free community space in the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture. The show runs through Dec. 7.

"I hope this exhibit can show my people in a different light," he says, pointing out how his larger-than-life-size photos pull you into the scene. While outside media parachuted in and filmed the sensational parts of the riots, Allen was there when it all started. He remembers photographing mainly peaceful demonstrations until, he says, a clash ensued April 25 when some baseball fans outside Camden Yards started yelling racial slurs.

Outsiders made the rioting that followed Gray's funeral on April 27 seem like an overreaction to one man's death, but Allen maintains that tensions between the mainly black inner city and the police had been boiling for a long time. He's been racially profiled himself, he says. Once, walking home from Baltimore City Community College, two police officers looking for a 6-foot-tall man with a dark complexion stopped him. "I'm like 5-foot-8, short, brown skin," he says. "They took my books and dumped everything in the street. My homework was flying out and everything."

There are lots of other Baltimores, where people outside the inner city can't comprehend that racial and class tensions are alive and well. But by capturing that in an image, he says, he can give observers a glimpse into why riots happen.

"My pictures are supposed to keep you aware," he says. "To make you think. To make you feel."

BALTIMORE — Parts of Baltimore continued to smolder Tuesday after a chaotic night of fires, looting and rioting stemming from the death of a black man who suffered a fatal injury in police custody.

"I have not made this decision lightly," he said in a televised news conference Monday evening. "The National Guard represents the last resort to restore order. ... Baltimore city families deserve peace and safety in their communities."

Newly confirmed U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch — the first black woman to serve as the nation's top law enforcement officer — condemned the violence.

"Those who commit violent actions, ostensibly in protest of the death of Freddie Gray, do a disservice to his family, to his loved ones, and to legitimate peaceful protesters who are working to improve their community for all its residents," Lynch said in a statement.
Nature is full of thieves. Instead of laboriously collecting pollen and nectar from flowers, robber bees raid the hives of other pollinators and steal the honey within. Some ant species routinely kidnap and enslave members of neighboring colonies, taking tens of thousands of pupae in a single season. And massive-winged frigate birds—also called pirate birds—swoop down on smaller seabirds and snatch the fish out of their beaks, or harass their victims until they regurgitate their latest catch.

Sea slugs dubbed sacoglossans are some of the most remarkable biological burglars on the planet. About the length of a postage stamp or two, these slugs feed on algae by sucking all the delicious gelatinous cytoplasm and crunchy protein nuggets out of the underwater plants. In the process, they slurp up algal chloroplasts, also known as plastids—green jelly bean-shaped organelles that perform photosynthesis, capturing the sun's energy and combining it with carbon dioxide and water to make food. Most sap-vacuuming slugs digest the chloroplasts right away, but some species store the plastids for weeks to months in large transparent digestive glands, turning the animals brilliant shades of green.

A few years ago, scientists thought they had started to crack this conundrum. In 2008, Mary Rumpho of the University of Connecticut and her colleagues discovered that an especially chartreuse species of sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, had taken at least one of the chloroplast-maintenance genes from the alga's nucleus and woven it into its own slug genome. This fascinating and rather unique instance of horizontal gene transfer could potentially explain how the slugs kept the chloroplasts running.

DES MOINES, Iowa — A man who created a nonprofit organization credited with helping more than 150 million people out of poverty was named the winner of the 2015 World Food Prize on July 1.

DHAKA, Bangladesh — Mukhta Mollah deftly smooths the red fabric and guides it through a whirling sewing machine. She sews side seams on women's blouses bound for America. Eight hours a day or longer in this hot and sweaty factory. Six days a week.

Seamstresses sit all around her in rows that stretch across this factory floor crowded with 350 workers. Fluorescent lights buzz and blink overhead. Enormous fans nosily push around the stagnant air, which carries the familiar scent of new clothes.

It takes Mollah less than 30 seconds to complete her part of the blouse. A helper snips the thread ends and piles the garments into a bin to take to the next station. Mollah has long grown accustomed to the mind-numbing repetition, the unrelenting din, the glare, the heat.

One reviewer on Amazon explained: Barbie "admits, 'I'm only creating the design idea, I'll need Steven and Brian's help to turn it into a real game.' Literally six sentences into the story, and already Barbie CANNOT do it. She immediately admits she doesn't know how to actually do computer engineering."

Parents, perhaps mindful of their daughters' futures, are helping to make STEM dolls a "burgeoning category," said Jackie Breyer, editor-in-chief for gift guide Toy Insider.

The Mighty Makers line from K'nex, for example, includes a construction set in which two small female dolls get to build their dream house from the ground up. The I am Elemental line of female action figures features a character named Industry who can "repair anything that is broken." iBesties is a doll line promoting entrepreneurship.

Research announced last summer by Purdue University found that engineering or building toys are purchased for boys twice as often as girls.

Chicago's Timeless Toys carries Lottie and GoldieBlox lines. Besides encouraging girls to open their minds to scientific fields, "Lottie dolls have been very popular because they have a positive body-type image," store manager Scott Friedland said. "They look like preteens instead of fashion models." Lottie dolls wear bomber jackets, long-sleeve T-shirts, sturdy brown boots, cargo shorts and baseball caps. They don't wear makeup, jewelry or high heels.

For the third time in 10 years, the Red Sox carried the prize through their city in a "rolling rally" of amphibious "duck boats" as thousands of fans lined the streets and the banks of the waterway that separates Boston from Cambridge.

The most poignant moment occurred early in Saturday's trip when the vehicles stopped at the Boston Marathon finish line, near where two explosions killed three spectators at the race on April 15.

"That was an emotional moment," Gomes said. "To bring the World Series trophy to the finish line, I don't think that the story was written that way, but I was glad to be a part of it and put the exclamation point on it."

Before the rally began at Fenway, Manager John Farrell recalled that the Red Sox had left after their 3-2 win over the Tampa Bay Rays the day of the Marathon for Logan Airport for a road trip. Along the way, they saw emergency vehicles responding to the explosions.

"Knowing that we were heading out of town, that's going to bring back a lot, and a lot of uncertainty at that moment," Farrell said, "because no one knew where to turn next. So we were fortunate to be part of maybe a little bit of a healing process."

Boston's climb from last place in the AL East in 2012 to the top of the baseball world was stunning.

Then the team boarded 25 duck boats of many colors — pink, yellow, maroon, lime green, white and more — normally used for tourist trips.

Some boats even had light brown carpeting cut into the shape of beards attached on the front.

The girls were paired in the Rising Stars Buddy Baseball program in west suburban Wheaton, Illinois, which matches students with special needs with partners on the field. But Dungan, then 13, was shy and preferred nail polish and Disney princesses to running bases and wearing a batting helmet.

As of this year, every NBA team has access to sophisticated tracking data that can tell them the position of the ball and every player on the court for every second of every game of the season. The data, provided by a system of cameras developed by a company called SportVU and installed in every NBA arena, is starting to revolutionize professional basketball, influencing everything from game strategy and player conditioning to how fans interact with the sport.

Michael J. Zogry, an associate professor of religious studies, obtained the nearly three-minute audio in November from the Library of Congress. It was part of a radio show from New York station WOR-AM called "We the People." During the Jan. 31, 1939, program, Naismith explained how he set up the game with two peach baskets at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts, in December 1891.

Silas is among 76 students at seven Buchtel and East elementary schools who participate in the extracurricular character-building program. Basketball and other sports normally aren't available until seventh grade.

"I think we all connected on the idea of combining mentoring and athletics to positively impact school climate. It was really a perfect marriage of all the things we want to do in student service," Rambler said.

The youth pastor at Mount Calvary Baptist Church graduated from Firestone in 1998 and coached middle school basketball at Reidinger after high school. Having witnessed truancy and behavioral issues last year as a mentor, Earley bounced the idea of creating a sixth-grade basketball league off Crouse Principal Angela Harper, who passed the notion along to Rambler and others in charge of student discipline, programming and athletics.

Dennis' curriculum helps the mentors, mostly counselors and case workers at the mental health group, teach the boys to own their actions, to redirect anger, to understand and respect others and to be proud of who they are, liberating them from the circumstances that keep many inner-city youth from their dreams.

The health agency focuses on the needs of under-served populations by providing training and support to children and adults in churches, schools, homes and throughout the community. "We want to touch what they touch and be where they are," Dennis said of a sincere, holistic approach to mental health.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — While New Jersey's little brown bat population, ravaged by a fungal disease, continues to slip toward likely extinction, another species, the big brown bat, appears to be benefiting, with its numbers rising as much as 50 percent in the state since white nose syndrome first hit in 2009, according to experts studying the species.

B.B. King, the singer and guitarist who put the blues in a three-piece suit and took the musical genre from the barrooms and back porches of the Mississippi Delta to Carnegie Hall and the world's toniest concert stages with a signature style emulated by generations of blues and rock musicians, has died. He was 89.

NEW YORK — It has been a big year for bears in the news, especially in Maine, where voters on Nov. 4 face a question that has bedeviled other bear-heavy states: how to keep the species' population at bay in the face of pressure from animal rights groups lobbying to ban certain hunting methods.

Voters are being asked whether these methods should be banned except to protect property, public safety, or for research.

Heavy-hitters on the "no" side include the National Rifle Association, the AFL-CIO and Governor Paul LePage. They face a massive infusion of campaign funds from the Humane Society, the ASPCA and other animal advocacy groups.

Opponents of Question 1 would seem to have momentum on their side, given some recent incidents in states with big bear numbers. The most notorious of these occurred last month in New Jersey, where a 22-year-old hiker was attacked and killed by a black bear.

Officials killed the bear, which a police report described as a large male weighing 250-300 pounds.

Also last month, a Santa Barbara County, California, woman fought off a black bear that attacked her while she was walking her dogs. Earlier this month, officials say a black bear devoured the remains of a man who had suffered a heart attack outside his remote home in Northern California.

But the Maine debate underscores a national reality: Black bear populations have increased, thanks to conservation efforts to protect the species, and so too have bear-human encounters in many areas.

In New Jersey, where Ridgewood police last month captured a black bear roaming near an elementary school, wildlife officials say reports of bear sightings have increased 23 percent over last year. The bear captured in Ridgewood was released back into the wild after it climbed a tree and was shot with a tranquilizer gun.

The latest polls show the "no" side ahead in Maine by a few percentage points, but supporters of Question 1 are hoping that a Maine judge rules in favor of their motion for an injunction to prevent the state's wildlife department from using public funds to fight the ballot measure.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Until last week, Florida black bears were mostly a source of awe and amusement to their suburban neighbors.

Sure, bear complaints were rising. The big lugs made repeated appearances in areas throughout Seminole County and other Central Florida communities, all of which made for fun Facebook posts and interesting coffee talk.

But no one had experienced a life-threatening injury because of a bear, and state wildlife experts regularly assured uneasy callers that the beasts would leave them alone if they just followed a few common-sense rules such as locking down their garbage.

All of that changed Dec. 2, when Susan Chalfant, a 54-year-old resident of Wingfield North near Wekiwa Springs State Park was mauled while walking her two small dogs on English Ivy Court. A spokeswoman for Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission called it the most serious documented bear attack in Florida history.

Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, whose district includes the area where the most bear complaints in Florida have been lodged during the past five years, said it's time for wildlife officials to reassess the state's bear-management strategies.

He pointed out that neighborhoods reporting human-bear conflicts are long-established residential communities and not new developments.

LOS GATOS, Calif. — Three punishing years of drought have parched California streams, rivers and wetlands.

"There's a growing interest in using beaver as a habitat restoration tool," said Michael M. Pollock, an ecosystems analyst with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle. "They create good wetland habitat much more cheaply than other restoration methods."

And to the bottom line. Bees pollinate up to $20 billion in American agricultural crops, a number that gets the attention of the industry. Monsanto, for one, owns Seminis, the country's largest fruit and vegetable seed producer — and many of those seeds depend on bees. Beyond that, Monsanto and its rivals have a financial interest in developing a marketable cure that has so far remained elusive.

"I know, definitively, that there's a relationship between treated seed and spring die-offs," said Christian Krupke, the study's lead author. "It (neonicotinoids) blows out behind the planter and gets in the air, it lands on dandelions. It lands on the bees, even."

LOS ANGELES — A rapidly mutating virus has leaped from plants to honeybees, where it is reproducing and contributing to the collapse of colonies vital to the multibillion-dollar agricultural industry, according to a new study.

Tobacco ringspot virus, a pollen-borne pathogen that causes blight in soy crops, was found during routine screening of commercial honeybees at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory, where further study revealed the RNA virus was replicating inside its Apis mellifera hosts and spreading to mites that travel from bee to bee, according to the study published online Tuesday in the journal mBio.

"For people, the obvious answer is: whenever possible, replace beef with something else," said Gidon Eshel, a geophysicist at Bard College and lead author of the study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "If you really need it to be from animal sources, that's still OK. You can still have bacon and eggs and whatever you want. As long as it's not beef, you have always made a significant step forward, because beef is so much more intensive than the rest."

DELEON SPRINGS, Fla. — Cow No. 150, her pregnant belly bulging, nosed around rancher David Strawn's pickup hoping to find something good to eat in the bed of the truck.

Advocates of grass-fed meat say it is leaner and contains a higher percentage of healthful fats, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants and fewer calories. It also is better for the environment, provides jobs in rural communities and is kinder to the cattle, goats, sheep and bison destined to wind up on a dinner plate, according to the American Grassfed Association, which was formed in 2003.

WASHINGTON — After surviving years of drought and watching the size of the U.S. cattle herd fall to its lowest level in more than 60 years, Texas cattleman Bob McCan would just as soon steer clear of the U.S. government's latest meat-labeling rules.

For many U.S. consumers, it's a popular idea: Label packages to let them know what country the meat comes from.

"We don't want beef to become a luxury item," said McCan, a fifth-generation rancher from Victoria, Texas.

McCan, now the president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, is among a group of cattle producers and meat companies that has sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for moving ahead in late May with new country-of-origin labeling rules.

In a lawsuit filed July 8 in U.S. District Court in Washington, the groups claim the labels will hurt beef exports and are unconstitutional as "compelled speech" that doesn't advance a government interest.

Backers of the new rules, who say labeling can be done at a minimal cost, are braced for another battle with cattle producers.

"They're totally wrong — consumers have the right to know where products are from," said Joel Joseph, chairman of the Los Angeles-based Made in the USA Foundation, a group that promotes labeling and products manufactured in the United States. "It's not forced speech. It's just consumer information, the same kind of information that's on a label of a new car that says where an engine's from."

He offered some advice for McCan: "If he doesn't want to segregate his cattle, then he shouldn't get cattle from Mexico."

McCan said labeling is a marketing issue that should be left to the private sector.

"We're not anti-labeling at all," he said. "We just kind of feel like the government doesn't really need to be in our marketing system. It doesn't have to be dictated to us."

Cattle producers aren't the only unhappy ones.

The new labeling rules also could ignite a trade war with Canada, which is threatening to retaliate.

"I thought we were done with it, and all of a sudden it's still going on," said Chris Waldrop, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America.

But he said industry groups have opposed country-of-origin labeling since it first appeared in Congress' farm bill more than a decade ago.

"They've been trying to delay it ever since," Waldrop said. "This is just another effort to do that, but the public is not on their side on this. ... Consumers want more and more information about where their food comes from and how it's grown, and not less."

He cited a poll released by the Consumer Federation in May, which found that 90 percent of Americans back mandatory labeling of meat products.

McCan is not convinced.

Bees — along with birds, bats and butterflies — play a key function by pollinating commercial fruit and vegetable crops; alfalfa and clover that provide feed for cattle; and the nuts, seeds and fruits that sustain massive grizzly bears and delicate songbirds. Some estimates put the economic value of their activities at roughly $15 billion a year.

Sara Zhang, like many Beijing residents, has taken precautions at home to protect herself and her two children from the city's notorious air pollution. Yet her 7-year-old son's public school, Yunhe Elementary, has not installed any air purifiers —machines common in the city's expensive private schools — leaving its students no choice but to breathe the toxic air.

Experts say China's air pollution exacts a tremendous toll on human health. According to a 2013 study in the British medical journal Lancet, 350,000 to 500,000 people in China die prematurely every year because of smog.

BEIJING — Some residents took a smog holiday away from Beijing on Tuesday as the Chinese capital launched restrictions under its first red alert for pollution, closing schools, suspending factories and keeping half the vehicles off the streets.

Although Beijing has in recent years seen smog at much worse levels than Tuesday's, the latest bout of pollution was the first to trigger a red alert under a 2-year-old system that requires a forecast at the outset of at least 72 hours of consecutive high pollution.

The capital's hazardous smog has persisted despite the Chinese government's stated priority of cleaning up the legacy of pollution left from years of full-tilt economic growth. Most of the smog is blamed on coal-fired power plants, along with vehicle emissions, construction and factory work.

Under restrictions in effect Tuesday through Thursday, schools were urged to close voluntarily unless they had good air filtration. However, Beijing's education commission later followed up with a separate order for all schools to close during the three-day alert. Some residents grumbled about the inconvenience, and a few international schools sought permission to reopen Wednesday.

On Monday, the capital city of Beijing launched a tough ban that prohibits smoking in indoor public places and workplaces. As part of the campaign, it unfurled giant stop- smoking banners over the iconic Bird's Nest sports stadium, advised people to use an elaborate set of hand signals to tell those in their proximity to stop smoking, and raised fines for those caught smoking.

ATLANTA — The Georgia Aquarium has lost a legal battle to import 18 beluga whales from Russia, a federal judge ruled Monday.

TACOMA, Wash. — Ever since Mount St. Helens' cataclysmic eruption 34 years ago this month, scientists have been tracking the volcano's explosive energy to better understand how Washington's most active volcano works.

Using techniques developed by the oil industry, researchers are preparing to set off explosive charges buried in two dozen 80-foot-deep wells drilled around the mountain. They'll record the seismic energy of the explosions on thousands of portable seismometers placed by an army of volunteers traveling by car, on foot and on horseback.

Their goal is to see with greater clarity the details of how molten rock, or magma, makes its way to St. Helens' crater from the area where tectonic plates collide and the magma is created, some 60 miles beneath the surface.

The explosive experiments, or "active imaging events," scheduled for this summer are one part of a battery of multidisciplinary imaging experiments collectively called iMUSH for "Imaging Magma Under St. Helens." Together, they constitute what researchers say is the one of the most complete and ambitious series of imaging experiments ever conducted on any volcano in the world.

Does the magma pool in a reservoir at the crust? Does it make its way upward in a single, narrow pipelike conduit? Or does it collect in one or more underground ponds along the way?

Finding answers is important, scientists say, because it will enable them to better interpret the volcano's signals when magma is on the move. That knowledge, they say, will help them predict eruptions not only at St. Helens but also at other volcanoes in the Cascades and around the world — and possibly save many thousands of lives.

By combining the strengths of the various imaging methods, he said, individual weaknesses will be filtered out.

Malone and his colleagues are meeting to design 70 enhanced seismic stations that will be installed up to 30 miles from the mountain for "passive" tests that will measure natural seismicity.

But in the days since Bergdahl's high-profile release Saturday — celebrated as "a happy day" by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel — an alternate narrative has emerged. In this version, now suggested by several fellow soldiers who were stationed with Bergdahl at Observation Post Mest in eastern Afghanistan, the 28-year-old Idaho native is not a hero but a deserter.

Bergdahl was not taken prisoner on patrol, as some of the early versions of his capture in June 2009 seemed to imply, but voluntarily left his unit, several of these former colleagues now say. They are demanding that Bergdahl be punished for what they say was his decision to abandon his post, in their view jeopardizing the lives of soldiers who had to go looking for him.

Another platoon member, Evan Buetow, 27, said Bergdahl appeared to voluntarily leave the base and had spoken to fellow soldiers about "walking across the mountains on his own" or walking to India. They thought he was joking, Buetow said, "but then he ends up missing, and a light goes off."

Army officials have said their interviews with the newly freed captive will enable them to determine with some certainty what happened. The Pentagon has always referred to Bergdahl as a prisoner of war, and Hagel did not directly answer questions about whether the Army sergeant had voluntarily left his post.

The allegations of desertion have come on the heels of a heated political controversy over the Obama administration's decision to trade the five Taliban prisoners for Bergdahl. President Barack Obama has been accused of caving in to Taliban demands and raising the ransom price for any future U.S. servicemen captured by insurgents — and failing to properly notify Congress of the Guantanamo releases.

The inequalities between East and West, 25 years later, are no place better on display than in this town on the Berlin outskirts. This is the origin of what Germans call Kleinmachnow Syndrome — the term used to describe how Ossies suffered after reunification.

"It's had a huge impact. Everything from our call center to our website to our blog to our Facebook page just lit up," said Tom Popper, president of Insight Cuba. "People were Googling it and curious. The debate got heightened, and also people's awareness of this kind of tour was heightened."

Digital Commons Manager Nick Kerelchuk described the MLK library scene as "a culture of people connecting and sharing together."
After meeting with Biden, Xi said the U.S.-China relationship had gotten off to a good start this year "and has generally maintained a momentum of positive development." But he said the global situation is changing, with more pronounced challenges and regional hotspots that keep cropping up.

When Biden arrived later at the Great Hall of the People, a ceremonial edifice steps away from Tiananmen Square, any tensions between the United States and China were papered over as Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao welcomed him with an elaborate honor guard. A military band played the two countries' national anthems as Biden and Xi stood amid the massive hall's marble floors and crisscrossing red carpets.
<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140428_BIGHORN_SHEEP.jpg" />FRESNO, Calif. — Fifteen years ago, there were just 105 Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep across their namesake mountain range.

And just last month, four rams and 10 ewes, nine of which were pregnant, were helicoptered into Big Arroyo Canyon, high in the mountains about 10 miles east of Lodgepole in Sequoia National Park.

"This shows that recovery is actually feasible and possible," says Daniel Gammons, biologist at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. "Most species that end up on the endangered species list don't ever come off, and there's a real opportunity here to see success."

It's taken more than a decade of research to make it happen, with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Forest Service, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service all involved in the recovery.

The act of walking may not seem like a feat of agility, balance, strength and brainpower. But lose a leg, as Zac Vawter did after a motorcycle accident in 2009, and you will appreciate the myriad calculations that go into putting one foot in front of the other.

Taking on the challenge, a team of software and biomedical engineers, neuroscientists, surgeons and prosthetists has designed a prosthetic limb that can reproduce a full repertoire of ambulatory tricks by communicating seamlessly with Vawter's brain.

A report published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine describes how the team fit Vawter with a prosthetic leg that has learned — with the help of a computer and some electrodes — to read his intentions from a bundle of nerves that end above his missing knee.

For the roughly 1 million Americans who have lost a leg or part of one due to injury or disease, Vawter and his robotic leg offer the hope that future prosthetics might return the feel of a natural gait, kicking a soccer ball or climbing into a car without hoisting an inert artificial limb into the vehicle.

Weighing just over 10 pounds, the leg has two independent engines powering movement in the ankle and knee. And it bristles with sensors, including an accelerometer and gyroscope, each capable of detecting and measuring movement in three dimensions.

Most prosthetics in use today require the physical turn of a key to transition from one movement to another. But with the robotic leg, those transitions are effortless, Vawter said.

Within a few months of the amputation, those nerves had recovered from the shock of the injury and begun to regenerate and carry electrical impulses. When Vawter thought about flexing his right foot in a particular way, the rerouted nerve endings would consistently cause a distinctive contraction in his hamstring. When he pondered how he would position his foot on a stair step and ready it for the weight of his body, the muscle contraction would be elsewhere — but equally consistent.

A 20-year-old woman in Taiwan has achieved the dubious distinction of being the first patient known to have been sickened by a strain of bird flu known as H6N1.

The researchers identified 36 of her close contacts, including family members, co-workers and the people who treated her in the two hospitals. Six of these people became ill with fevers or respiratory infections (including one of the doctors who treated several patients with respiratory infections but did not wear a surgical mask or take other standard precautions). But none of them tested positive for influenza.

These naturally talented aviators can reach breathtaking heights; one goose has even been tracked as high as 4.5 miles, for a short while. But researchers have long argued about how high these birds might truly fly, and how on earth they manage to do it. Many researchers thought that once the geese attained a mountain-skimming height, they would stay at that altitude rather than waste energy dropping down and pushing back up again.

To find out, an international team of scientists led out of Bangor University in Wales needed some physiological data. So they outfitted bar-headed geese with customized implantable instruments that measured their body temperature, pressure, acceleration and heart rate during flight.

The researchers found that, rather than fly in a straight line—the most direct route to their destination — the geese would hug the terrain, ascending to get over a high peak and descending when the ground leveled out. This meant doing extra work to keep flying upward, over and over again.

Seems like a lot of extra flying for very little gain — but it ends up being the most efficient way to travel. The scientists calculated that if the birds had gradually risen in a straight line to reach those 1,390 meters, it actually would have raised the energetic cost of the journey by 8 percent.

That's probably because maintaining high altitudes can be very costly. After all, higher altitudes mean thinner air—which means the birds have less air to push against, which means it takes more work to get anywhere. The higher the birds were, the higher their wing-beat frequency. And their heart rate was highly sensitive to wing-beat frequency — a 5 percent increase in flap rate meant a 19 percent jump in heart rate, and a 41 percent rise in estimated flight power.

The herd, which had been managed before through hunts, has been out of reach since the animals wandered into Grand Canyon National Park several years ago, where they cannot be hunted.

"They stay in the park because they understand they're protected inside," said Diane Chalfant, Grand Canyon deputy superintendent.

Although it will take close to two years of study and public input to develop a final plan, Chalfant said one option being looked at is finding ways to get the bison out of the national park and on to state lands where they can be hunted.

The animals are not native to the Grand Canyon but were brought to northern Arizona more than 100 years ago, as part of an experiment to breed a bison-cattle hybrid.

"We want to get a sense of where the public is coming from on this," Chalfant said. But she said the park service is leaning toward moving the bison to hunting areas where their numbers can be managed.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — One sign that Evan Neal isn't your typical 16-year-old: He contributes a few hundred dollars toward the monthly electric bill at his father's house to cover the cost of running his energy-hungry computer equipment.

It's all part of the latest business venture launched by the tech-savvy, rising high school junior, who uses high-powered computer processing to obtain newly created bitcoins, a process known by cognoscenti of the digital currency world as bitcoin mining.

A profitable experience, that is. By Evan's calculations, he estimates he has reaped more than $2,000 in profit after deducting hefty expenses. Those costs include buying specialized hardware and contributing $200 to $300 to the electric bill at his dad's house.

Piece by piece, archaeologists and historians from two universities and the community are uncovering the history of The Hill, which they believe is the earliest settlement of free African-Americans in the United States, dating to 1790.

"It's not just a black story. It's an American story," said Dale Green, a Morgan State University professor of architecture and historic preservation.

Green said the work on The Hill could change the way American history is told. There's a significant gap where the story of free blacks is overlooked, he said.

To come to these conclusions, the researchers looked at radio waves and X-rays that were emitted by black hole 4U 1630-47.

Instead, she might be working, along with some co-workers. Sears is among the many retailers that will be open on Thanksgiving Day.

"We really don't want to work that, but who would say no when you need the money?" said Nabors, 22, of Chicago, who works part time for $9 per hour and is a single mother to an infant and a 3-year-old.

Whether she volunteers or not, she may be chosen to work that day anyway.

"To me, that's what Thanksgiving does, it brings you and your family together," Nabors said. "And this is just taking it away."

The media studies major hoped to jump from Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire right into the Chicago workforce, in marketing or event planning, so he could get his own apartment and begin helping his family financially. But after more than a year of networking, sending out applications and asking mentors for help, Winfield still doesn't have a full-time job. In fact, he said, he's rarely been called back for an interview.

While unemployment is falling to its lowest level in years, recent college graduates across the country are nonetheless struggling to find work. A new report found that, for young African-Americans with a four-year degree, the job search has been especially brutal. They are having a harder time than whites finding a job, are more likely to be in a job that does not require their college degree and are being paid less than white workers with the same experience.

The exterior will be layered with 3,600 bronze latticed panels — "coronas" — to make it gleam, inspired by the decorative ironwork crafted by slaves in Charleston, S.C., and New Orleans.

Some large artifacts already have been put in place — shrink-wrapped for now — so that the building can be built around them.

A railroad car with different compartments for whites in the front and a sign for "colored" in the back has been restored. It serves as a compelling example of how the Jim Crow-era segregation laws separated blacks and whites in public facilities. Jim Crow was a derogatory term for African-Americans.

Visitors will be able to walk through the vintage 1918 Southern Railway car, used from 1940-1960 on routes in Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, and see the comfortable seating for whites and the divider that kept African-Americans in the basic seating in the back.

"This rail car … is a tangible remnant from America's long years of segregation, and those remnants are rare," said Peter Claussen, the chairman and CEO of Gulf &amp; Ohio Railways, who donated the rail car to the museum and who's also a member of the Smithsonian National Board. "The separate water fountains are gone. The black and white sections of movie theaters are gone. There are very few objects that allow people to see what segregation was like, and this is one of them."

For Bunch, who started out in 2005 with just two staffers and no artifacts, and others who've devoted their lives to creating a museum to honor African-Americans, their long-sought goal is within reach.

Time magazine and The New York Times noted the milestone. And Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who'd opened the White House doors after entreaties from African-American publishers, greeted the reporter as he made his way over to the president's desk, telling him, "Glad to see you, McAlpin."

It was not a sentiment shared by McAlpin's fellow scribes, members of the White House Correspondents' Association who for a decade had denied black reporters the opportunity to attend the twice-weekly news conferences in the Oval Office.

Not missing a beat, McAlpin said, his father had replied: "I always thought the White House press would be the cream of the crop. I can't imagine that would happen. But if it did, it would be the story of the year and I wouldn't want to miss it.' "

"They blackballed him from ever joining the correspondents' association or attending the group's annual dinner," said Condon, who recommended creating the scholarship. "The president could break the color line for his press conferences, but he could not rewrite the WHCA's membership policies."

In an essay that aired sometime in the 1950s on Edward R. Murrow's "This I Believe" radio series, McAlpin spoke movingly of the struggles he faced as he confronted racism.

![](https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150602-AMX-SOCCER63.png) Sepp Blatter, the longtime president of FIFA, announced his resignation Tuesday, a stunning about-face that came just days after he celebrated his re-election and defiantly criticized U.S. law enforcement agencies leading a corruption investigation that has rocked world soccer's governing body.

While Blatter proved adept at increasing FIFA's wealth, the organization he ran has been plagued by rumors of corruption, bribes and backroom deals, usually involving its presidential elections and its votes on World Cup sites. Blatter's resignation immediately calls into question whether the 2022 World Cup will go on as planned in Qatar, whose winning bid might be the most controversial in FIFA's history.

Brazilian soccer legend and current senator Romario de Souza Faria, known simply as Romario, wrote on Facebook that Blatter's resignation was the "best news in ages" and that it "begins a new era for world football."

Argentine soccer god Diego Maradona told an Argentine radio station that "today the truth is out and I am enjoying it."

Britain's sports and culture secretary, John Whittingdale, called Blatter's move "belated" and said it was "only the beginning of the process of change we need to see from FIFA."

Ryo Hirosawa pushed the tip of his tongue hard to his palate, and made a sharp click.

BERKELEY, Calif. — Growing up blind, the closest Ann Kwong came to a competitive sport, even in P.E., was a marshmallow-eating contest. Judith Lung never learned how to throw a ball.

That hasn't stopped his love of learning, and reading, especially histories of European royalty and World War II.

Just before the holiday break, Westridge students took home sheets with spelling words to study. Richie's list was made with a Braille embosser. He studied during the days off from school, but not every day.

On a recent school day, Richie and his class were matching subjects with verbs that agree. While the other kids used papers and pencils, Richie read a Braille sheet with the words prepared ahead of time. He then typed out the answers using the six keys on a Braille notetaker. To use the machine, Richie learned different codes for not only the letters of the alphabet, but 180 contractions.

HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. — Despite being born blind, Alan Brint always has a clear vision for how he wants to be viewed by others — no differently than anyone else.

LOS ANGELES — It's called "the blob," and some blame it for the thousands of dead seabirds and emaciated sea lion pups that have washed ashore on California beaches since late last year.

Scientists believe that the Pacific Ocean began a cold phase in the late 1990s, and that this was largely responsible for an unexpected slowdown, or so-called pause, in global temperatures. A warm-phase "flip" could reverse that, they say, accelerating the increase in global average temperature and ushering in a period of wetter weather for Southern California and the American South — among other widespread effects.

The price of a single camera ranges widely, from less than $100 to more than $1,000, based on the size of the purchase (larger police departments often get a discount) and whether the deal includes data storage services. But managing and storing the video costs many times the price of the cameras themselves. And because the technology is so new, it's likely that it will have to be replaced fairly quickly, which would require additional expenditures.

In New Jersey, legislation enacted last fall requires officers or the vehicles they routinely use in traffic stops to have cameras, either on the officer or on the dashboard in the car.

Giving local governments the option — body camera or dashboard camera — was a compromise to help pass the bill, said Democratic Assemblyman Paul Moriarty, who sponsored the legislation. The measure only applies to newly acquired vehicles, and it exempts officers who work in administrative roles or detectives who don't regularly conduct traffic stops.

WASHINGTON — In a stunning move, House Speaker John Boehner informed fellow Republicans on Friday that he would resign from Congress at the end of October, giving up his top leadership post and his seat in the House in the face of hardline conservative opposition.

Since Boeing rolled out its first 777 to a huge crowd at its manufacturing facility in Everett, Wash., in 1994, more than 1,100 have been built and only one had been in a major accident, with no fatalities.

On Saturday, Asiana Flight 214 from Seoul, South Korea, crashed after touching down on Runway 28, killing at least two passengers and injuring dozens of others.

BOGOTA, Colombia — This gritty city of 7.6 million rarely gets respect. It often ranks near the bottom in "livability" surveys and near the top of the hemisphere's ugliest capitals.

But in recent years, it has been getting an unintentional makeover, as lax laws and blank walls have made it a haven for local and international graffiti artists.

Now, this Andean capital seems to be in bloom, as everything from high-art to hurried scrawls spring from overpasses, storefronts and sidewalks. The splash of color is earning the city accolades and recognition in the art world — even as some here wonder about the line between art and vandalism.

Bogota's street-art scene is part accident, part design. The city was already becoming a hotbed for graffiti when the mayor rolled out a law last year trying to regulate the practice. Now, graffiti is allowed everywhere except monuments, government buildings and public infrastructure; artists need permission before tagging private property. But while fines and sanctions do exist, some say the new rules have given graffiti a veneer of legitimacy and turned Bogota into a street-artist Wild West.

"You that seized and detained my brethren for five years, you arrested and kept a woman without getting married for four, five years. You seized and hold our children. You did all this to us and today, because we did what God already told us to do, you are busy making noise, 'Shekau has kidnapped this and that, he said he would sell.' Yes, I will sell.

FOWLER, Calif. — Luckily, Shandeep Dhillon's cousin had recently gotten married.

That meant he alone could outfit much of Fowler High School for its first Bollywood night. His uncle's regal, embroidered sherwani coat went to the Central Valley school's principal, Hank Gutierrez. The outfit Shandeep, 13, had worn but outgrew went to Gutierrez's son Jordan, and Shandheep wore another cousin's, on down the line of his extended family's wedding clothes.

The Punjabi girls at school all had salvar kameez outfits they could lend to their Latina, Armenian and Swedish classmates.

"We go to lots and lots of Indian weddings and you dress up and feel like a princess," said Manpreet Shaliwal, 16, in silky, peacock blue.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — Before he even started school, Jason Borders tended to collect objects such as animal bones that he found while exploring his neighborhood near Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, Ky.

"I always had a little cabinet of curiosities in my room, and in the garage," Borders recalls.

Years later, Borders still is collecting bones and curiosities, only now they are his canvas for intricate designs and hang in galleries where they sell for hundreds and thousands of dollars each.

Borders now lives in Portland, Ore., with his wife, fellow Henry Clay High School graduate Elizabeth Sumney Borders. But he was back in Lexington this month to open a show of his work at Mulberry &amp; Lime, a downtown home furnishings and gift shop that also sells work by local artists.

The pieces consist of animal bones, mostly skulls, into which Borders has engraved and inked complex designs of lines and dots that resemble traditional mehndi tattoos. The designs usually are not symmetrical, taking on forms that can look like old maps, paisley patterns and other designs.

At first, Borders says, the bones were something he dabbled with, trying to learn how to best work with them. He also continues to paint.

There is a distinct Borders style at work in the bones, his paintings and his other work.

With their iPads and smartphones programmed to pick up high-frequency chirps, volunteers trained by Bohn located the first roost ever documented in Southeast Florida, near the Gables Granada Golf Course in September. Her team also recorded more than 20,000 calls, providing a trove of new data that shows the pug-nosed bats feed and sing like no other bat in the United States, in a range much larger than previously suspected.

On Roberts' lap was a library book, "Thumbelina," on Xia's, two Barbie dolls sitting positioned to listen along to the tale. As Roberts turned the page to reveal a glowing illustration, Xia's eyes widened, her lips forming an "oh" of surprise.

"The more people hear about the book bike, the more excitement it can generate," she said.

The book bike hopes to stop by a local open-air market in the coming weeks and possibly local schools once the school year starts, Skwerski said. But for now, Skwerski is enjoying the trips to playgrounds in the warm weather, where she can witness children's eager excitement to read.

"I don't want to say it tricks them into reading," says Sacharow, an IT project manager based in Miramar, Florida. "But there are books kids are reading for schools and books that they hopefully like in their free time. And if 'Minecraft' books are a motivation to read, that's a good thing, right? At the very least, they're developing skills, reading skills."

"We first heard from kids themselves about 'Minecraft,' and we started watching a lot of YouTube videos to see what the buzz was about," said Debra Dorfman, Scholastic's vice president and publisher for licensing.

A senior editor for books at Amazon.com, Chris Schluep notes that other game-related releases have succeeded. Last year, "The Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Historia" was a surprise best seller (published, fittingly, by Dark Horse Books). He also cited books tied to "Halo" and "World of Warcraft."

WASHINGTON — Every day, 80 to 120 children cross the Texas border illegally — and alone. What's happening in Texas reflects a nationwide trend: Immigration by undocumented children under 18 is on the rise, even as fewer adults come into the country illegally.

Most of the children end up staying here. ORR data show that more than 65 percent of these children from 2008 to 2010 were ultimately placed with sponsors living in the United States. Sponsors ideally are family, but also included are licensed programs willing to accept legal custody of a child, such as shelters for homeless youth. Other children returned to their home country or turned 18 and were transferred to adult immigration authorities.

With the increased caseload, advocates worry the government is not paying enough attention to the sponsors, to ensure that the family members or family friends can adequately take care of these children and that the environment is suitable.

His method, like his music, was improvisational and low-tech: He inserted electronic equipment into an Altoids tin, turning it into a microphone. Weyant filled the tin with magnets and pressed it against the fence a few inches off the ground. Wires attached to the tin led to an amp and several effects pedals — the kind electric guitarists use — which allow him to manipulate sounds.

"Nobody thought of the border wall as possibly anything other than something to separate people," he said. "I transform it. I play it."

From 2004 to 2010, the federal government contracted with a privately owned juvenile detention facility in Vincennes, Indiana, to house immigrant children deemed the most dangerous.

As the Immigration Clinic Director of Indiana University's McKinney School of Law, I traveled to Vincennes with volunteer law school students to provide legal assistance to these kids.

Not every child is entitled to admission. But turning children away at gunpoint is inconsistent with established law and practice. Our youngest immigrants must continue to have their legal rights protected, provided visas when merited, and repatriated safely as necessary.

After all, the current crisis has been stoked by loose talk in Washington about a possible "amnesty" of illegal immigrants, stoked by Obama's 2012 decision to suspend deportation of youth with long-standing ties to the United States, and news that young children arriving at the border were being released pending hearings.

A new study of students in Germany reveals that there are five distinct types of boredom. That's one more than researchers had expected.

What's more, the newly discovered category — which they labeled "apathetic boredom" — was quite common among high school students, according to the study, published this week in the journal Motivation and Emotion.

Boredom isn't just boring. It can be dangerous, either for the person who is bored or for the people around him. For instance, people who are bored are more likely to smoke, drink or use drugs. Kids who are bored are more likely to drop out of school and become juvenile delinquents. Studies have also linked boredom with stress and other health problems.

SAN FRANCISCO — Wary of head trauma, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland is leaving football. And not even the promise of NFL stardom and piles of money could change his mind.

The 49ers announced his decision Monday night, without offering specifics. But Borland told ESPN's "Outside the Lines" earlier in the day he wants to do "what's best for my health."

The NFL, like the 49ers, said it respects Borland's decision, adding that "playing any sport is a personal decision." The league stressed that "football has never been safer," noting progress with rule changes, tackling techniques, equipment, protocols and medical care.

BOSTON — Under heavy security that included a battery of surveillance cameras and police officers on rooftops, nearly 36,000 runners hit the streets Monday in the first Boston Marathon since last year's deadly bombing, sending a powerful message of resilience.

A total of 35,755 athletes were registered to run, the second-largest field in its history, with many coming to show support for the city and its signature sporting event. "Boston Strong" — the unofficial slogan adopted after the terrorist attack — was everywhere.

"She is my inspiration from day one last year when I saw her in the ICU. Every run I do, she is in the back of my head, and she will be keeping me going today," Dello Russo said.

American Meb Keflizighi won the men's title in 2 hours, 8 minutes, 37 seconds. Cheers rose up as word of the first American man to win in Boston since 1983 spread through the pack of runners.

The nor'easters have exhausted patience for raising self-inflicted obstacles that have the potential for mass disruption, adding a visceral argument to meld with concerns over finances and other aspects of planning a large-scale event in one of the nation's smallest major cities.

In a damp ceremony of discovery Thursday, snow-flecked excavators in Boston retrieved a time capsule whose contents are thought to be almost as old as the nation, and even older. It was tucked into a cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House in 1795.

The contents are thought to include a collection of coins dating from 1652 to 1855, when the cowhide capsule was replaced with a metal box. An engraved silver plate, newspapers, the seal of the Commonwealth, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records are also believed to be inside.

Not long after, on July 18, 1776, the first Massachusetts reading of the Declaration of Independence occurred on the Old State House's balcony, as the public gathered on the street below.

The women of Wellesley College offer kisses and palm slaps to passing athletes in "Wellesley Scream Tunnel." ''Heartbreak Hill" captures the euphoria that exhausted runners feel once they've conquered it. "The Home Stretch" shows competitors surging past Boston's iconic Citgo sign and zeroing in on the finish line.

"The city is so determined to recapture the race, and these paintings are definitely in keeping with that joy," she said.

MOUNT IDA, Ark. — The teeming plant world could become a virtual mystery in the coming decades as college students increasingly shy away from studying botany and universities across the U.S. shutter their long-standing herbaria.

Since 1988, the number of research universities offering botany degrees has dropped by half, according to National Science Foundation research funding statistics. And the National Center for Education Statistics reports that fewer than 400 undergraduate, graduate and doctoral botany degrees were awarded in 2012. Educators say that's because students are being pushed into more modern, technology-related majors.

Current botanists fear that will lead to a dearth of people able to teach about, identify and use plants, which could harm conservation efforts and even the ability to develop alternate fuels and important medicines. At the same time, universities and states struggling under budget cuts are closing the sometimes-expensive task of maintaining herbaria — collections of plant species that botanists can reference or use for genetic material.

In a clearing on the side of a rural Arkansas highway, about a dozen researchers scoured the rocky glade for a threatened annual called the Missouri bladderpod, which blooms with clusters of small yellow flowers. Only 75 populations of the threatened species exist in the world, and all are close enough to urban centers to be in danger, Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission botanist Theo Witsell said.

Herbaria are a major reference source for botanists, but increasingly, such repositories are dwindling as several states and universities have closed or consolidated their collections, including the University of Iowa and the University of Nebraska State Museum. Researchers acknowledge the bulky collections of plant specimens that are mounted, dried, dated and tagged with pivotal information can be hard to maintain. They require temperature and moisture control and space for the preparation process.

Holly Holm's smart training program created a Sunday destruction in Melbourne, Australia, of previously unbeaten, and perceived-to-be-unbeatable, Ronda Rousey.

"I have a lot of respect for Ronda," Holm said. "This wouldn't have meant as much if it hadn't been for what she has done. She's been imposing her will on everybody. She tried the hip-toss, the arm bar. I just wanted to stay focused. We did this in practice. I (knew I) could do it again."

The president of the Boy Scouts of America urged the organization Thursday to reconsider its blanket ban on gay leaders, saying Scouting must keep up with the times on the issue or face "the end of us as a national movement."

"We must deal with the world as it is, not as we might wish it would be," said Gates, who oversaw the end of the military's ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly while he was at the Pentagon. "The status quo in our movement's membership standards cannot be sustained."

In his speech, Gates suggested a change in policy aimed at satisfying the faction within the Scouts that would like to see the gay ban lifted, while protecting the right of religious groups to reject gay leaders. His proposed compromise would allow individual sponsoring organizations to decide the policy for their own troops.

"The one thing we cannot do is put our heads in the sand and pretend this challenge will go away or abate," Gates said. "Quite the opposite is happening."
Tom Brady has been an NFL golden boy, with movie-star looks, a supermodel wife, four Super Bowl championship rings, and a regular-guy-makes-good back story — he went from being a sixth-round draft pick to one of the greatest quarterbacks in league history.

The punishment comes days after the league announced results of an investigation that found Brady was "likely generally aware" that equipment assistants employed by the team had conspired to deflate the Patriots' footballs for last season's AFC championship game, making the balls easier to throw and catch.

Team owner Robert Kraft released a statement saying that the Patriots had intended on accepting whatever discipline was imposed by the league, but that the punishment "far exceeded any reasonable expectation" and "was based completely on circumstantial rather than hard or conclusive evidence."

Most of us have experienced writer's block at some point, sitting down to write, paint or compose only to find we can't get the creative juices flowing. Most frustrating of all, the more effort and thought we put into it, the harder it may become. Now, at least, neuroscientists might have found a clue about why it is so hard to force that creative spark.

Researchers at Stanford University recently set out to explore the neural basis of creativity and came up with surprising findings. Their study, published May 28 in Scientific Reports, suggests the cerebellum, the brain region typically associated with movement, is involved in creativity. If so, the discovery could change our understanding of the neurological mechanisms behind some thought processes. (Scientific American and Scientific Reports are both parts of Nature Publishing Group.)

The study authors then repeated the analysis with different cutoffs for being "most male" and "most female." Regardless of whether they used a threshold of 10 percent, 20 percent or 50 percent, the brains with a combination of male and female features far outnumbered the brains that were exclusively male or exclusively female.

Anyone who's ever learned music probably remembers reaching a point when they just played without "thinking" about the notes.

The findings could lend insight into why children learn some tasks faster than adults, and could point toward ways to help adults learn faster and to make classrooms more conducive to learning, according to the authors.

To the folks at UFO Sightings Daily, NASA's archive of Mars images from its rovers is better than a candy shop. Every visit yields a new treat.

From baby boomers fearing memory loss to college students wanting a mental boost, interest in brain-training products is soaring. Yet among leading scientists, there is persistent scrutiny and skepticism. Last year 70 cognitive researchers signed a statement speaking out against computer-based games that promise better cognitive performance, citing a lack of scientific evidence to back such claims.

At the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry on Wednesday, Akili Interactive Labs presented data from a pilot study of its video game, Project: EVO, that showed some positive results in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Approximately 6.4 million in the U.S. and one-tenth of children worldwide suffer from the condition and struggle with paying attention and controlling their impulses.

Based on research by U.C.S.F. neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley, the adventure game has modern graphics and immersive features. Players tilt their tablet devices to steer a raft down a winding icy river and tap their screens to catch aliens and other objects while avoiding distractors. As the players improve, the game gets harder.

According to the game's developers, by having players manage quick decision-making on top of a continuous motor task, Evo's software is designed to strengthen neural circuits responsible for key cognitive functions, such as attention and working memory, which typically become impaired in those suffering from ADHD. These circuits "enable us to properly assimilate multiple streams of information to control and prioritize sensory inputs," says Akili co-founder Eddie Martucci. The hope is that "when you engage in the game pretty intensely for long periods of time, it actually reconditions how the brain processes information."

English pop singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran is the closer at the other end of the half-mile-long infield from Elton John. At the same time, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, the Terence Blanchard E-Collective, and Greg Stafford and his Young Tuxedo Jazz Band will be on other stages. So will rapper T.I.; Dwayne Dopsie and the Zydeco Hellraisers, the Wimberly Family Gospel Singers, instrumental rock band Woodenhead, and Cha Wa, a Mardi Gras Indian funk band.

White, who started his musical career in brass bands, said brass bands evolved from the fusion of military marching bands, black Creoles who played classical music, and jazz, which was both music and "a symbol of the life, the affirmation, the hopes and dreams of the people."

This time, the dolls are more covered up. There are fewer midriff-baring crop tops and faces laden with eye shadow. Instead, dolls now come with smartphones and accessories printed with emojis.

Children now "demand digital innovation," Larian said. "More and more kids are watching content online, whether it's YouTube or Netflix, and Bratz has its own YouTube channel."

The cancellation marks the second presidential visit scrapped because of diplomatic umbrage related to Snowden and the trove of secret surveillance documents he has leaked to news media.

Violence broke out in more than 10 cities late Thursday and early Friday, and an 18-year-old man was killed and three people injured when they were hit by a car trying to drive around a protester-erected barricade in Ribeirao Preto, 185 miles north of Sao Paolo. On Friday, a second person died of a heart attack as a tear-gas canister exploded near her, according to Brazilian news agencies.

Ingrid Munique, 18, joined the demonstrations in Rio de Janeiro with dozens of her neighbors from the Complexo Alemao favela, who chanted, "I'll give up the World Cup. I want money for health and education."

"The Brazilian people are not against the World Cup, but they are against the exorbitant expenditures on stadiums," said Edgar Reinoso, 61, as he coughed on tear gas during the Thursday night protest in Rio. "For Brazilians to come to the streets this way, it means a lot is wrong — mainly, corruption."

"Those 40 million who have entered the middle class have seen the promised land and they have liked it very much," said Paulo Sotero, director of the Brazil Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C. "The agenda of the protestors is a middle-class agenda." While Brazil's economic progress has been real, Brazilians are increasingly struck by the persistence of the problems of underdevelopment, Sotero said from Sao Paulo, where he is visiting.

WASHINGTON — Researchers at a New York City hospital several years ago conducted a test of the widely accepted notion that skipping breakfast can make you fat.

"In overweight individuals, skipping breakfast daily for 4 weeks leads to a reduction in body weight," the researchers from Columbia University concluded in a paper published last year.

One of the primary troubles in observational studies is what scientists refer to as "confounders" - basically, unaccounted factors that can lead researchers to make mistaken assumptions about causes. For example, suppose breakfast skippers have a personality trait that makes them more likely to gain weight than breakfast eaters. If that's the case, it might look as if skipping breakfast causes weight gain even though the cause is the personality trait.

"Brian has jeopardized the trust millions of Americans place in NBC News," Steve Burke, president of NBCUniversal, said in a statement. "His actions are inexcusable and this suspension is severe and appropriate."

Three months ago, the Bank of England announced that Winston Churchill had been chosen as the new face of the 5-pound note, in recognition of "a truly great British leader, orator and writer ... a hero of the entire free world." Starting in 2016, Churchill's jowly mug will peer out pugnaciously from the back of what is probably Britain's most widely used bill, worth about $7.50.

True, Queen Elizabeth II's smiling face graces every bill printed and every coin minted in Britain. But that's entirely because of her position as monarch, not personal or professional accomplishment, and her job is not one that women can realistically aspire to or work hard to achieve, except for Kate Middleton.

Criado-Perez, a freelance journalist, has launched a campaign to restore at least a little bit of gender balance to the great and good depicted on British currency, which she says is mandated by anti-sexism legislation. More than 30,000 people have signed her online petition so far, and dozens of female members of Parliament have joined in the call for redress.

The selection process is opaque and closed to the public. The bank lists "broad name recognition" as a requirement for those it picks, though probably not one Brit in a thousand could tell you who Matthew Boulton was (an 18th century engineer) and not one in 10,000 could identify John Houblon (the Bank of England's first governor). Both men have adorned the 50-pound note.

For that matter, few people could probably identify Elizabeth Fry, the woman currently featured on the fiver. Even Criado-Perez confesses to knowing little about her or her work in penal reform.

But there are plenty of other women, both well-known and unsung, who have made important contributions to British or world history and deserve a spot on a bank note, activists say. One frequently cited as a prime candidate is Rosalind Franklin, the scientist now acknowledged to have played a key role in the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA, despite most of the credit — and the Nobel Prize — going to her male colleagues, James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins.

The Bank of England shouldn't fall prey to the same sour sexism, said Criado-Perez, who said she would be delighted if Jane Austen were the next woman chosen.

Conditions inside the 19th-century buildings have become so dire that they threaten to achieve what the Nazi blitz of London could not: force Her Majesty, the noble peers in the House of Lords and the uppity members of the House of Commons to abandon their digs, at least while refurbishment is undertaken.

Across St. James' Park, a makeover for the Gothic Revival Palace of Westminster — famed for the clock tower mistakenly called Big Ben, which is actually the name of the giant bell inside the belfry — would cost significantly more. According to an independent appraisal released in June, the project could run from $5.4 billion to $8.8 billion.

Exam boards in England and Wales — which set school syllabuses in line with government rules — on Friday finished releasing their new book lists for the English Literature GCSE, an exam taken by 16-year-olds after a two-year course of study.

Gone are Lee, Steinbeck, Arthur Miller's play "The Crucible" and the autobiography of Maya Angelou, who died this week. Gone, too, are African and Asian writers including Haruki Murakami, Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche.

But debate on the changes has focused on the loss of "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Of Mice and Men," which several generations of Britons remember — mostly fondly — from their school days.

Few commentators had anything negative to say about Lee's beloved tale of a girl learning about racism and justice in the American South. Outraged fans of the book even got the hashtag "#Mockingbird" trending on Twitter after Gove's changes were announced.

"It's true ... 'Of Mice and Men' is set just because it's short, but it is nonetheless a marvelous book for teaching," Carey said. "It's a wonderful book, deeply human. I think the same about 'To Kill a Mockingbird' — a book that can transform the way you think."
The 30-year-old student and mother of three from Leeds in northern England beat two other finalists with her enticing iced buns, perfect raspberry millefeuille and a lemon-drizzle wedding cake wrapped in a sari in the red, white and blue of the Union Jack.

Hussain told the BBC on Thursday that winning the show — pre-recorded in June — was "one of the best moments of my life."

"So often, the issues facing boys and young men of color get caught up in long-running ideological arguments — about race and class and crime and poverty, the role of government, partisan politics," the president said in a packed White House East Room. "But the urgency of the situation requires us to move past some of those old arguments and focus on getting something done and focusing on what works. Doesn't mean the arguments are unimportant; it just means that they can't paralyze us."

The initiative was shaped in part by two meetings Obama had with a chapter of the Chicago-based group Becoming a Man, which left a deep impression on the president and the group's young African-American men. The last time they saw the president, they presented him with a Father's Day card in the Oval Office, leaving him speechless.

Around that time, Obama directed his staff to start looking at how to help African-American boys in ways that didn't involve any grand new federal programs.

The result is a public-private partnership designed to better focus existing government funds and to leverage private investment. The official announcement, originally scheduled for two weeks ago, was delayed by a snowstorm.

Researchers used fragments of charcoal from the early wooden temple and grains of sand to date the structure. The tests involved "a combination of radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence techniques," the authors of Monday's study said.
If the midnight Monday deadline passes without a deal, a shutdown would affect a wide range of programs, from national parks to the Pentagon.

President Barack Obama and the leader of the Democratic-controlled Senate dismissed a late developing plan approved early Sunday by the GOP-run House that would delay by a year key part of the new health care law and repeal a tax on medical devices, in exchange for avoiding a shutdown.

Lawmakers spoke past one another on the Sunday talk shows, often rehashing the turbulent fights about the health overhaul that the Supreme Court has upheld, as the nation edged toward the first government shutdown in 17 years.

The House's near party-line vote was 231-192, shifting the focus to the Senate less than 48 hours before government funds would run dry.

The Senate was not scheduled to meet until midafternoon Monday, 10 hours before a shutdown would begin, and even some Republicans said privately they feared that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., held the advantage in the fast-approaching end game.

Head Start provides preschool services to 3- to 5-year-olds from low-income households and offers their families education, health, nutrition and social services. Early Head Start supports the families of infants and pregnant women.

The Palm Beach Board of County Commissioners voted to eliminate bus service for about 2,300 children in Head Start to avoid cutting slots. In Colorado Springs, the Community Partnership for Childhood Development sold enough chairs representing empty Head Start seats at $500 apiece to re-open a class of 16 students.

In many cases, though, there was no way to avoid shrinking enrollment. In Indiana, at least two Head Start programs used lotteries to decide which preschoolers had to stop attending in March.

The California legislature voted in June to increase funding for childcare and early childhood education by $100 million, while Ohio will boost early childhood spending by $30 million this fiscal year.

In Chicago, a loss of roughly $6.5 million in federal Head Start funding threatened up to 1,000 slots for Head Start and Early Head Start, which serves children under age three and their families. Mayor Rahm Emanuel ordered the city's Department of Family and Support Services to absorb the cuts by reducing administrative overhead.

Because Head Start programs begin their fiscal years in different months, some felt the impact of the sequestration immediately while others had more time to absorb the cuts.

The Ohio Head Start Association estimates about 2,100 slots for children and babies in Ohio will be cut in fiscal year 2013 because of sequestration, according to executive director Barb Haxton. She estimates the budget cuts have resulted in a loss of 307 staff jobs across the state and prompted programs to cut an average of two weeks per program.

As executive director of Knox County Head Start in Ohio, Peg Tazewell opted to increase class sizes from 16 or 17 students to about 20 rather than reduce the number of spots for children. In addition, she eliminated six positions, including three layoffs, and reduced transportation for students, which means parents will have to drive their children up to six miles to a bus stop rather than have their children picked up and dropped off at their house. Some of the children will now have to ride the bus as far as 20 miles.

A few days ago, Chartier and his students offered a New York City bracketology seminar to about 45 basketball fans who paid up to $100 each for the privilege. About 20 members of the national media came to observe. Chartier is also a member of a New York Times panel tasked by the paper to put together a winning bracket. The other members: Four young girls who rotate in the title role of Broadway's "Matilda the Musical."

"He didn't immediately reply," Chartier said. "He sat and thought about it. Then he said, 'Yeah, I'm okay with that.' "

As 18-year-old Andres Del Castillo sweeps a magenta cape, he emits a soft guttural sound. His chest is thrust forward, his lips are puckered and his mouth bulges. He ends the pass with one leg fully extended behind him, his foot in a point, the other firmly planted below. After the imaginary bull passes, his gaze lifts as he takes a few triumphant strides.

His teacher for the past six weeks has been Gonzalo Rincon, the father of legendary Colombian bullfighter Cesar Rincon, who was famously lofted on the shoulders of his compatriots after four stunning performances in Madrid in 1991.

In Colombia, most teenagers play Xbox, soccer or chase girls, not bulls. Across the country, from large cities to small towns, bulls once formed an integral part of annual celebrations. Today, the Spanish colonial tradition is disappearing amid sometimes violent protests, changing cultural norms and a struggling business model.

"I think this is the lowest moment in the tradition," said Rincon, a bull rancher in retirement who lives in Madrid with his father and spends four months of the year in Colombia. About a dozen bull ranches across the country have gone out of business in the last decade as fewer plazas and small towns host fights.

Meanwhile, ticket prices are too high for most Colombians. A lower-level seat in Medellin costs the equivalent of a monthly minimum wage salary. Benjamin de Los Rios, director of Medellin's Plaza de la Macarena, says pricing is part of a "vicious cycle" as international bullfighters that draw crowds command up to $140,000 per afternoon. The result is a half-empty arena and fewer parents passing on the tradition to their children.

Before a recent bullfight at la Macarena, a protester who gave his name only as Juan G. for fear of threats from aficionados, led a protest of about 30 college-aged students from across the street.

"We have to teach our roots, the backbone of our tradition," he said. "In Colombia, bullfighting is not an art, it is not a sport, it is a profession that is controversial. And since it is controversial, there is no form of government support."

In recent years, anti-bullfighting advocates appeared to be gaining the upper hand. "Politicians have realized that they can win votes by saying they are against bullfighting," said Colombian bullfighter Manuel Libardo, 28, who was voted Colombia's best matador this year but believes Colombia's bullfighting future is uncertain.

Bogota's ornate Plaza de Toros de Santamaria, with its broad Moorish facade built in 1931, has been shuttered for the past two years, the result of an anti-bullfighting campaign that won the support of the city's embattled leftist mayor and former guerrilla, Gustavo Petro. Colombia's other plazas suffered losses as a result, but recovered this year.

Last year, the group decided they would not bullfight in Quito until the law is changed and the tradition is restored. A makeshift bullring was set up outside the city limits, and the group is anticipating a change this year.

Researchers Robert Faris of the University of California at Davis and Diane Felmlee of Penn State University write that traditional, everyday views of bullying — reported by nearly a fifth of teens — tell less than the whole story. "For most students, gains in status increase the likelihood of victimization and the severity of its consequences," they wrote in the journal of the American Sociological Association.

Some students found protection; being friends with teens of the opposite gender provided some shield.

George Nathaniel, 49, of Richfield, who is also a pastor for a pair of Minneapolis churches, was in his second year as a school bus driver for Durham School Services, a bus company under contract with Burnsville-Eagan-Savage District 191.

After receiving a complaint from the school district about the prayer, Durham gave Nathaniel a warning and assigned him two new bus routes serving Edward D. Neill Elementary School and Metcalf Junior High School in Burnsville, he said.

That didn't dissuade Nathaniel. "I let them know I am a pastor and I am going to pray," Nathaniel said.

The law has tried to balance employees' rights to express religious beliefs and the rights of others to be free from the imposition of those beliefs, said Marshall Tanick, a Twin Cities-based employment lawyer.

But Nikki Williams, whose three children also ride the bus to and from Neill Elementary, said "it wouldn't bother me at all" if a bus driver prayed with students.

Nathaniel said he talked to parents as he saw them at bus stops, let them know he was a pastor and asked if it would be OK for him to pray with the kids on the bus. "The parents I talked with, they were in agreement that I was doing fine."

Nathaniel said he had driven school buses in Wisconsin and Georgia before coming to Minnesota and had always prayed with the kids.

By springtime, a lot of high school seniors are cruising to the end of school. Maceo Rucker-Shivers can't afford to join them.

His class work at Olympic High School's math/science school in Charlotte, N.C., and his after-school job at nearby Bosch Rexroth Corp. are preparing him for work as a machinist technician. His supervisors at the German company are watching to see whether his skills and work ethic justify paying his tuition at community college after graduation.

Rucker-Shivers may represent the future of public education.

It's a future with closer links among K-12 schools, community colleges and private employers, influenced by the European apprenticeship model. It's one where the "college for all" mantra yields to a recognition that for many students, training for skilled jobs is more meaningful than a four-year degree. And it's one where promising students can start earning right away — sometimes while they're in high school — rather than taking on college debt.

The 2013-14 CMS budget calls for creating career-tech hubs at traditional high schools and launching new magnets focused on internships and career skills. Olympic, a model for the school district, got a head start when it split into five career-themed academies in 2006. Business partnerships, career exploration and real-life projects were central to the new approach.

"All that testing stuff and all that rote memorization stuff is not going to help you in the real world," said career development coordinator Michael Realon. Before coming to Olympic to teach business, economics and math, he worked for trade associations, including the Charlotte Apparel Mart. He now acts as Olympic's liaison to the business community.

Realon (pronounced Ray-lon) says Olympic helps students explore career prospects, starting with an online assessment of their skills and interests, which gives them a list of their 20 best career "matches."

Meanwhile, Rucker-Shivers recently got good news about his own economic future. His work paid off: He got an apprenticeship with Bosch.
SPOKANE VALLEY, Wash. — At Spokane Valley Sportscards, collectors come once a month for their version of a poker night, breaking open factory-sealed boxes of cards, looking for what they call a hit. They may have different teams they favor, but they're all after big-name players, the ones whose cards could command hundreds of dollars.

Among the regulars, Joseph Branda is known as the risk-taker.

He's the one who once bought a $600 box of basketball cards, the kind that comes in an intricate wooden chest. He's the one with the collection that's potentially worth as much as a decent car. On this Saturday, as the others hold back their spending, he's the one who just asked for another box of football cards, wagering $140 on coming away with a prized addition to his collection.

Leaning over a counter, Branda, 22, quickly sorts through the box. He rips open six packs, each holding six cards, and flips through a lineup of professional football players.

It's a hit. He's scored Robert Griffin III, a Heisman Trophy winner and starting quarterback for the Washington Redskins. The limited-run card is autographed. It also has a swatch of his jersey attached to it.

All conversation in the room stops, and several of the others huddle around him. They gawk at the card.

The regulars who come to Bisson's shop — a group of no more than a dozen, sipping on the root beers he sells for 50 cents a can — are not very interested, however, in making trades.

His passion (or vice, depending on how you look at it) is what drew him into this business. Twenty years ago, the salesman at the shop where Bisson bought his cards wanted to branch out on his own. He asked a few of his patrons — including Bisson, then working as a photographer — to go in with him.

Bisson's the only one still in the business. He runs the store — which focuses on sports memorabilia but also carries political collectibles — from an old ranch-style house in this Spokane, Wash., suburb.

In what was once a cozy living room, racks of card boxes block the windows, and the fireplace is hidden behind shelves of merchandise, including a football autographed by Barry Sanders, and mini-helmets signed by William "Refrigerator" Perry and Russell Wilson. In the den, a worn, sea-green sofa faces a wall overtaken by Bisson's version of a library card catalog, where the cards of almost any athlete a collector might be looking for are organized in alphabetical order: Troy Aikman. Kobe Bryant. Jay Cutler.

On good days, maybe a dozen people walk in. There are many days, though, when it's just Bisson, propped on a stool behind the case of baseball cards that serves as a counter as he sorts and prices his inventory.

A number of those who show up are looking to sell rather than buy. Their collections usually date to the early 1990s, when sports cards were a fad. Now they've got boxes of overproduced memorabilia that is as good as garbage, as Bisson tells one man who lugged in his collection one afternoon.

"That's the respect that we give each other," said Miranda, a 50-year-old Woodland Park, N.J., resident. "They call me by saying, 'Hey, master sergeant.' "

And Home Depot isn't the only business that's looking to beef up its staff, and find innovative ways beyond job fairs, to connect with veterans.

At Home Depot, Miranda said he has a chance to advance and is working for a company that shares the same values of the Army — such as loyalty, duty, respect and service.

LOS ANGELES — Pity the poor male common Mormon swallowtail butterfly. His potential female consorts bear four different color patterns, only one of which looks familiar. The rest look suspiciously like other species, and toxic ones at that.

More broad questions remain too. "If mimicry is helping these females survive, why on Earth aren't the males getting the same advantage?" Kronforst said. "We simply do not understand the answer to that question."

Kronforst believes that counterbalancing selection may be at play — some advantageous trait is paired with the seemingly maladaptive one, and both are conserved. (In humans, that counterbalancing arrangement pairs sickle cell with malaria resistance.)

—Require golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscaped spaces to reduce water consumption.

—Ban the water of ornamental grass on public street medians.

BALTIMORE — Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner California Chrome has just three weeks and 1 ½ miles of racing in the June 7 Belmont Stakes ahead of him in his bid to become horse racing's 12th Triple Crown winner, a task that has proved impossible in the new era of racing.

The 5,000 residents of this former lumber town in Mendocino County on the edge of redwood country are now on a crash water diet. A family of four isn't supposed to use more than 150 gallons a day. Outdoor watering, car washing and hosing down pavement are banned. Businesses have been ordered to cut water use 35 percent.

As the winter progresses with no break from last year's parched conditions, concern is mounting that California may be headed for a replay of the big drought of the late 1980s through the early 1990s, or even worse, 1977.

The snow and rain could still come. Only about half the rainy season is over. But if monotonously sunny weather continues to curse the state, the pain of water shortages will spread, albeit unevenly.

THREE RIVERS, Calif. — Black bears are a cherished part of the community here, a woodsy gateway town that funnels tourists to Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, where the first question many visitors ask of rangers is "Where can I see a bear?"

Local shop owner Cindy Skeen said she often sees black bears around her house, finding them more mischievous than menacing.

As a practical matter, no one can say how much an end-to-end ride on the bullet train would actually cost if and when the system becomes fully operational, a milestone the state expects to reach some time in 2028. At that point, ticket pricing will be set in consultation with a private company hired by the California High-Speed Rail Authority to operate the system, said rail agency Chief Executive Jeff Morales.

Fares will be one of the most important factors in the decisions that millions of travelers will make when choosing to fly, drive or ride the bullet train. And they are central to revenue calculations for a system that by state law must operate without a taxpayer subsidy.

Advocates of calorie posting were betting that when confronted with the calorie loads delivered by their favorite menu items, consumers would scan the menu for acceptable lower-calorie alternatives. They also hoped that restaurant giants would be shamed by the uniformly fattening fare they offered, and make menu changes to accommodate their health-conscious customers.

PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Sitting in a dingy bar down a small back alley in the Cambodian capital, Ros Choun struggled to explain how he ended up here.

Despite the location and his Cambodian appearance, Choun had spent almost his entire life in the United States. In fact, at 35, he refuses to consider himself anything but American. His family, he recounts, sought refuge in America in the early 1980s after fleeing the genocide and devastation of the Khmer Rouge period, which left Cambodia in ruins and almost 2 million people dead.

"I was 6 months old when I left this country — I'm American — but no one told us if we go to prison we could get deported back to Cambodia," he said, his eyes downcast and his voice filled with anger.

A new study suggests socializing and storytelling around a communal fire may have offered our hunting and gathering ancestors a unique time to expand their minds and imaginations in ways that were not possible during the hard work and harsh light of the daytime hours.

When humans first learned to control fire about 400,000 years ago, the quality of their lives changed dramatically. Brain size and gut size increased, predators no longer posed such a dire threat and our ancestors' circadian rhythms shifted as firelight extended the day by several hours, according to the study.

"During the day, the conversation was kind of nasty a lot of the time," Wiessner said, "but at night they would mellow out and talk about the past. They would space travel and talk about group gatherings happening far away, they would cross time to their forefathers, and they traveled, in the stories, to other realms."

It's an expectation written on the Facebook page of San Jose Family Camp near Yosemite, which was scorched on the edges by fire last summer but will be ready for returning generations of campers when it opens for the season Friday.

"It's like your home burning down," said Scott Gelfand, 55, who hadn't missed a year at Tuolumne Family Camp for 29 years since he worked his first summer there and had been bringing his family ever since. "The memories are so deep and so important and so loving and so family- and community-oriented, I think most people are still in shock."

"It's like everything's been shaken underneath us. We're super-excited, but it's kind of scary," said Moreno, whose daughters are prime camper ages at 7 and 9. "While my kids know the camp is burned, it's going to be a very different experience to show up at camp but have it not be camp."

It is estimated that more than 150,000 First Nations, Inuit and Metis children were separated from their families and forced into residential schools run by the Catholic and Anglican churches on behalf of the federal government over much of the last century in a deliberate policy to "take the Indian out of the child."

The Canadian government is scrutinizing its laws and policies to see whether they are strong enough to deal with national security threats after two of its citizens, who had been flagged by authorities as safety risks, were successful in carrying out high-profile attacks.

Speaking at the Parliament building just yards from where a gunman was shot dead the day before, Prime Minister Stephen Harper pledged last week to expedite a plan to give the country's security forces greater powers in the areas of surveillance, detention and arrest.

After fatally shooting Corporal Nathan Cirillo, who was standing guard at the war memorial in Ottawa shortly before 10 a.m., Zehaf-Bibeau got into a car he had purchased the previous day and drove the short distance to Parliament Hill, according to a timeline presented at the news conference. The legislative complex consists of several buildings, known as blocks.

On a chilly, overcast day, the war memorial was thronged with people who had brought flowers, notes or just their thoughts as the capital grappled with the apparent act of terror.

Workers began erecting the 1.1 million pounds of scaffolding in May 2014. Inside the dome, they installed a puffy cloth just below the ceiling for interior renovations, with a doughnut hole in the middle that allows visitors to see the mural in the eye of the rotunda.

LOS ANGELES — One of the first things Steve Barnett did when he took the helm at Capitol Records in 2012 was to pull down all the framed and platinum records that had long adorned the lobby of the landmark Capitol Tower offices in Hollywood. The cheap cardboard cutout of the Beatles that used to greet visitors, also gone.

A key part of that improvement has been Barnett's eye toward the future, as Capitol scored two of the biggest breakout artists of the year: British singer-songwriter Sam Smith and Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer.

"It sounds like some of these aquariums are not willing to step into the fight. They're basically giving up, which is not a good sign for SeaWorld," said Scott Smith, a University of South Carolina hospitality professor whose specialties include theme parks.

Clumps of the brownish seaweed known as sargassum have long washed up on Caribbean coastlines, but researchers say the algae blooms have exploded in extent and frequency in recent years. The 2015 seaweed invasion appears to be a bumper crop, with a number of shorelines so severely hit that some tourists have canceled summer trips and lawmakers on Tobago have termed it a "natural disaster."

PITTSBURGH — Over the past decade, the Carnegie Science Center (CSC) has considered itself a leader in the area of science education for girls, creating programs such as science sleepovers, implementing school tours of workplaces of successful scientists and creating a website, CanTEEN, aimed at tween and teenage girls.

So imagine CSC's surprise to find itself called "disgusting" and "a disgrace" because its sole offering for the Girl Scouts is a program called "Science With a Sparkle" — teaching how to become a "cosmetic chemist."

As for Science With a Sparkle, the program has been around for about five years, said Linda Ortenzo, director of STEM programs at the Science Center. It was actually named years ago by a research panel that presented a group of girls with a few different options. "They picked that one," Ortenzo said.

Heather Arnet, CEO of the Women &amp; Girls Foundation of Western Pennsylvania, has worked with the Science Center for years on issues involving gender equity and programming for girls. For her, the backlash against the CSC was surprising, given its "long historical commitment to the issue of engaging girls in STEM."

But in all the negative words directed toward the Center, she also saw a silver lining.

"What I think was really great was the parent response all over social media," she said. "You saw mothers and fathers really engaged in this passionate conversation about the need for girls to have equity in STEM offerings and to be engaged in STEM, and that's a good thing for everyone."
ATLANTA — Determining what treatment to pursue for former President Jimmy Carter's cancer will depend on its type, its origin and factors such as age and health, doctors said.

The statement indicates that the 39th president's cancer is widespread but not where it originated, or even whether that is known at this point. The liver is often a place where cancer spreads and less commonly is the primary source of it.

Age by itself does not preclude successful cancer treatment, said Dr. Lodovico Balducci, a specialist on treating cancer in the elderly at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. Much depends on the patient's "biological" age versus his actual years, he said.

"A man 90 years old normally would have a life expectancy of two or three years, but Jimmy Carter is probably much younger than that" in terms of his function, Balducci said. "If he tolerated liver surgery, I imagine he has a relatively good tolerance" to other treatments that might be tried. For example, Moffitt has developed a scoring system to estimate how well an older person would tolerate chemotherapy and the risk of serious side effects.

Despite remaining active through the years, Carter's health has recently become the subject of speculation. In May, he was forced to cut short an election observation visit to Guyana when he developed a bad cold.

Carter also completed a book tour this summer to promote his latest work, "A Full Life," which includes his family's history of pancreatic cancer. He wrote in the memoir that his father, brother and two sisters all died of the disease and said the trend "concerned" the former president's doctors at Emory.

Carter wrote that being the only nonsmoker in his family "may have been what led to my longer life."

Like "most of my colleagues," Telnaes said she has received threats because of her work, one serious enough after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to prompt an FBI investigation. In her view, political cartoons engage and enrage more than articles do because they are visual and transcend language barriers.

NEW YORK — They speak different languages, live in countries rich and poor, face horrible job markets and healthy ones. When it comes to money, though, they act as one: They're holding tight to their cash, driven more by a fear of losing what they have than a desire to add to it.

Five years after U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, triggering a global financial crisis and shattering confidence worldwide, families in countries as varied as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Germany remain hunkered down, too spooked and distrustful to take chances with their money.

Weak growth around the world means wages in the United States, which aren't keeping up with inflation, will continue to rise slowly. Record unemployment in parts of Europe, higher than 35 percent among youth in several countries, won't fall quickly. Another wave of Chinese, Brazilians and Indians rising into the middle class, as hundreds of millions did during the boom years last decade, is unlikely.

Some of the retrenchment is not surprising: High unemployment in many countries means fewer people with paychecks to spend. Some people who lost jobs got new ones that pay less or are part time. But even people with good jobs and little fear of losing them remain cautious.

The AP analyzed data showing what consumers did with their money in the five years before the Great Recession began in December 2007 and in the five years that followed, through the end of 2012. The focus was on the world's 10 biggest economies — the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Brazil, Russia, Italy and India — which have half the world's population and 65 percent of global gross domestic product.

"Given what they've lived through, households are loath to borrow again," says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of BMO Private Bank in Chicago. "They're not going to stretch. They want a cushion."

A study by two University of Tokyo researchers, published by Springer in Animal Cognition journal, determined cats recognize their owners' voices from those of strangers. Conducted by Atsuko Saito and Kazutaka Shinozuka, the test included 20 domesticated cats from 14 homes that were tested in their own familiar places so the stress of moving them to strange surroundings had no role in the outcome of the tests. With the owners out of the cats' line of vision, researchers played recordings of three strangers calling the cats' names followed by a call from the cat's owner and then by the call of another stranger.

When strangers called their names, the cats had no reaction to the voices whatsoever. When the cats heard their names being called by their owners, they moved their heads and ears to locate where the sound was coming from.

LOS ANGELES — The oldest fossils of a previously unknown ancient leopard species are shaking the pantherine evolutionary tree, suggesting that big cats arose in Asia, not Africa, according to a new study.

Paleontologists led by the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles and the University of Southern California discovered the previously undescribed sister species to the modern snow leopard while on a 2010 expedition to Tibet. Seven specimens from three individuals range in age from 4.1 million to 5.9 million years old — dialing back the clock on big cat evolution by as much as 2 million years, according to the paper, published online Tuesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Panthera blytheae, named for the daughter of longtime museum benefactors Paul and Heather Haaga of La Canada Flintridge, was slightly smaller than the snow leopard and probably roamed the Tibetan plateau for several million years, dining on an ample supply of antelope, pika and blue sheep, according to paleontologist Zhijie Jack Tseng, lead author of the paper.

Big cats have presented serious problems for paleontologists. The ancient ambush hunters' preferred habitat proved unproductive for fossilization, leaving a poor record of a sojourn on Earth that exceeded that of modern man by millions of years.

Archaeologists in China have unearthed the first clear evidence of cats living among humans as semi-domesticated mousers about 5,300 years ago, a heretofore missing link in the history of the world's most popular pet, experts say.

The evidence, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, supports the long-held view that cats began their symbiotic relationship with people following the advent of agriculture, many thousands of years after dogs were tamed by nomadic hunter-gatherers.

The discovery fills in an enormous gap in experts' understanding of cat domestication, but it has also thrown them for a curve. In some ways, an ancient Chinese village is the last place researchers expected to find such evidence.

"This was a very unexpected find," said study co-author Fiona Marshall, a zooarchaeologist at Washington University in St. Louis.

Each year, scores of cave freaks, spelunkers and speleologists gather at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, Mammoth Cave National Park in Kentucky and here in Nevada to pick and wipe away buildup that can threaten both the formations and the cave's inhabitants.

The cave — part of Great Basin National Park, in the desert outback between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City — was officially discovered in 1885 by prospector and miner Absalom Lehman, but many believe Native Americans used the cavern eons before that.

Lehman and later caretakers offered candlelight tours long before the cave became a national monument in 1922. But there have been other intruders: During Prohibition, Lehman Cave served as a secret speakeasy — complete with a dance floor. Federal officials later used the 2-mile-long cavern, 200 feet below ground at its lowest point, as a well-stocked Cold War fallout shelter.

TEL AVIV, Israel — If you thought recycling was just a modern phenomenon championed by environmentalists — think again.

Our prehistoric ancestors learned to recycle the objects they used in their daily lives thousands of years ago. Researchers presented the evidence at a conference in Tel Aviv.

It's the first time researchers have shown how much cavemen recycled and how they did it, said Ran Barkai. He's an archaeologist and one of the organizers of the four-day meeting at Tel Aviv University.

Early humans collected discarded and broken tools made of flint and bone to make new utensils, Barkai said. It's just like we recycle paper and plastic today, he explained.

The early recycling shows it was a survival strategy, said Avi Gopher, a Tel Aviv University archaeologist. Maybe early humans they didn't worry about pollution and the environment, but they shared some of our motivations, he said.

Some cases could go as far back as 1.3 million years ago, said Deborah Barsky, an archaeologist with the University of Tarragona. A find near a prehistoric lake in Spain found basic reworking of flint, she said. But she added it was hard to tell whether this was really recycling.

"I think it was just something you picked up unconsciously and used to make something else," Barsky said. "Only after years and years does this become systematic."

On any given day, 34.3 percent of U.S. children and teens between the ages of 2 and 19 eats pizza, fried chicken, tacos or some other dish prepared in a fast-food restaurant, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

More specifically, 12.1 percent of these young diners will get more than 40 percent of their daily calories in the form of fast food. An additional 10.7 percent will trace 25 percent to 40 percent of their daily calories to a fast-food joint, and 11.6 percent will get fewer than 25 percent of their calories from one of these dining establishments.

There was a significant difference in fast-food consumption according to race and ethnicity. Asian-American children and teens were less likely than their peers to visit a fast-food joint: Only 8 percent did so on any given day, on average. That compared with 11.2 percent of Latinos, 13.1 percent of whites and 13.9 percent of African-Americans. The differences among non-Asian youths were not statistically significant.

The other significant difference had to do with age. Overall, children between the ages of 2 and 11 were much less likely than adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19 to dine on fast food. On a typical day, 8.7 percent of the younger children ate fast food, compared with 16.9 percent of older children. That pattern was seen regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, weight status or family income, the researchers found.

When it comes to squeezing tiny, individual living cells out into orderly patterns for lab experiments, scientists usually use inkjet printers, but those have their limits. So they've turned to a much older technology for a solution: Chinese woodblock printing, developed roughly 2 millennia ago.

"We have a very diverse and complex identity," said Hatab Samham, whose organization was part of a coalition that wrote a letter to federal officials formally requesting the new category. More than two dozen Arab-American and other MENA groups signed on to the letter. "More of us would identify as people of color. The kind of strict racial options that we have right now don't fit."

Race is an ever shifting, ever evolving concept in America. From the 1890s through the 1930s, an African-American family with a mixed-race heritage, for example, could be classified as everything from "quadroon" to "mulatto" to "black" to "Negro," depending on the year and who was doing the classifying. Meanwhile, the "East Asian" category morphed into separate categories for Koreans, Filipinos, Japanese and "Hindus," or South Asians. The stakes were high: With the exception of freed slaves who were granted citizenship in 1864, for a long time, non-whites were not eligible for citizenship.

General Mills, the biggest seller of cereal in the United States, announced another disappointing quarter Wednesday morning, marking the sixth straight time the company has reported lower sales.

Breakfast cereal just isn't the morning mainstay it once was, crowded out by other options such as yogurt, snack bars and breakfast sandwiches. And families aren't sitting down to breakfast as often. Overall, cereal sales are down 6 percent since their peak in 2009, and they are projected to continue falling through at least 2019.

LOS ANGELES — Before Pluto's fall from planetary grace, there was Ceres. Depending on your definition, it's either the largest asteroid or the smallest dwarf planet — but for a few glorious decades in the 1800s, the rocky sphere was a full planet in the solar system's pantheon.

"Now we have really for the first time discovered water in the asteroid belt," said lead author Michael Kuppers, a planetary scientist based in Spain with the European Space Agency.

WASHINGTON — The United States military has deployed 80 troops to the country of Chad to help in the search for more than 270 girls kidnapped in Nigeria by that nation's most feared and powerful extremist group, Boko Haram, the White House told Congress on Wednesday.

Private, billionaire-led companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin have helped restore excitement around space exploration, which waned when the shuttle program ended in 2011.

Crippen noted that SpaceX and Orbital Sciences Corp. suffered disasters with unmanned rockets during the past two years, which should provide a valuable learning experience.



To those watching in Charleston and from afar, it was devastating.

"It's not just a church. It's also a symbol ... of black freedom," said Robert Greene, who studies the 20th century South at the University of South Carolina. "That's why so many folks are so upset tonight, because it's a church that represents so much about the rich history and tradition of African-Americans in Charleston."

In Charleston, the church is affectionately known as "Mother Emanuel," a nod to its age and its eminence in the community. It is a place people take pride in, said the Rev. Stephen Singleton, who was pastor there from 2006 to 2010 — all soaring ceilings and fine pinewood floors, with an antique pipe organ that had been shipped from Europe more than a century ago.

"They're just God-fearing people," Singleton said of his former congregation. "People who lived in modesty in light of the history of the congregation they called home."

"Where you are is a very special place in Charleston," the most recent pastor, Clementa Pinckney, told a group of visitors two years ago. "It's a very special place because this site, this area, has been tied to the history and life of African-Americans since about the early 1800s."

They had some reason for alarm: Denmark Vesey, the organizer of one of the nation's most notable failed slave uprisings, was a leader in the church. He fiercely and insistently preached that African-Americans were the new Israelites, that their enslavement would be punished with death, and in 1822 he and other leaders began plotting a rebellion.

After the end of the Civil War, the A.M.E. congregation — which had been conducting services in secret for decades and worked as part of the Underground Railroad — was formally re-established and adopted the name Emanuel. Parishioners rebuilt their church on Calhoun Street, a half mile away from Fort Sumter, where the Civil War's first shots were fired and, a block from the square that had been a military marching ground during the Civil War and the site of a celebratory parade of African-American residents once the conflict ended.

When that wooden building was destroyed in an 1886 earthquake, the congregation replaced it with the stately gothic revival structure seen today.

The church's activism resumed along with services, and by the 20th century it had become a focal point of South Carolina's civil rights movement.

Booker T. Washington spoke there in 1909 to a large audience of both white and black admirers. In 1962, Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech about voting rights and making the "American dream a reality." So did Roy Wilkins, as executive secretary of the NAACP. In 1969, as Charleston was in the midst of a massive strike aimed at creating a union for the state's mostly black hospital workers, Coretta Scott King led a march from Emanuel A.M.E.'s steps while 1,000 state troopers and national guardsmen looked on.

"If there was any sort of civil rights protest or activity in Charleston it was almost always centered around that church," Greene said.

Singleton, the former pastor of Emanuel A.M.E., said the church was still a place for political organizing when he was there. Politicians often dropped in, he recalled. Parishioners organized for community issues.

Pinckney, 41, the current pastor who was in the church when the gunman opened fire, was even more active. For more than a decade he had served as a member of the South Carolina State Senate. He was an advocate for a bill in the state legislature that would require police officers to wear body cameras, calling it "our No. 1 priority," according to the Charleston Post and Courier.

For many, the initial response was one of shock.

"If we're not safe in the church, God, you tell us where we are safe," mourners at a prayer circle told a reporter for MSNBC.

But Robert Mickey, a University of Michigan political scientist who studies race and politics in the post-War South, noted that activist African-American churches have been targeted before.

"They've been sites of black protest and community organizing, and they have long been targets as well," he said, noting the long list of racist attacks on black churches, particularly the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.

Chavez was born July 28, 1954, one of seven children in a family that lived in a dirt-floor home. He had a mix of Spanish, African, and indigenous American ancestry. His parents, though both teachers, struggled financially and sent him to live with his grandmother, along with his older brother, Adan. He dreamed of becoming a baseball player, but entered Venezuela's military academy at age 17.

In February 1992, Chavez led a failed attempt to topple the government. His co-conspirators were either killed or arrested and Chavez spent two years in jail. When he was released, after a presidential pardon, he decided to use democratic means to gain power, and went from being a soldier to a politician. He ran for president in 1998 and won with 56 percent of the vote.

From the beginning of his presidency, Chavez made social reform a priority by opening state-run grocery stores that offered subsidized food, and provided health care and literacy training to the poor.

Chavez used Venezuela's vast oil wealth to gain influence internationally. He provided billions of dollars in subsidized oil to Cuba each year. Beginning in 2005, Chavez offered discounted heating oil and other economic aid to poor residents of the South Bronx neighborhood of New York. He made several memorable appearances at the United Nations, including one in 2006 when he called U.S. President George W. Bush "the devil" after criticizing the U.S.-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He allied himself with foes of the United States, including Fidel Castro of Cuba, Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.

Chavez gave weekly addresses on a television program that sometimes ran as long as seven hours, with Chavez acting as both host and guest. The show "Alo Presidente," or "Hello President," featured his own lengthy speeches, singing and dancing. He sometimes used it to rail against the U.S., as in February 2005 when he accused the United States of planning to kill him. "If I am assassinated there is only one person responsible, the president of the United States," Chavez said. In later years, he used Twitter, gaining four million followers; he gave his three millionth follower a free home.

Despite being democratically elected, Chavez faced criticism that during his 14 years in office he stifled political opposition and centered power around himself and his political party. He was accused of dominating the courts, Congress and the media. He changed Venezuela's Constitution to allow himself to run permanently for president.

However, even his critics admit that he gave the poor more of a voice in the country. Yet, despite increased spending on social programs, many in the country remain in poverty. As the economy sagged and prices rose for basic goods, the middle class felt its wealth slipping away. The crime rate rose during Chavez's presidency and Venezuela's capital, Caracas, became one of the most dangerous capitals in the world.

Despite the criticisms, Chavez remains a hero to many Venezuelans, who affectionately called him "el comandante." Hundreds of thousands flooded the streets of Caracas during his funeral procession. His final resting place is in the army barracks where he made his first attempt to overthrow the government.
The sound was like nothing Tom Hinton had ever heard before: a chorus of baleful wolf howls, long and loud and coming from seemingly every direction in the darkness. The predators yipped and chirped and crooned to one another for what seemed like forever, sending a shiver of awe and intuitive fear down Hinton's spine.

"It was a primordial experience," he said, something most of humanity hasn't felt for tens of thousands of years. "That dates back to when humans were prey."

That's according to a study published this week in the journal Current Biology, which found that mammal numbers in the exclusion zone are as high, if not higher, than in even the most protected parks in Belarus.

Even the Soviet city of Pripyat in Ukraine, which once housed tens of thousands of workers at the Chernobyl plant, has been subsumed by trees.

But in the end, his eyes gave him away.

The player was expelled from the tournament, and the Italian Chess Federation is mulling charges of sports fraud, the Telegraph reported. Coqueraut told the Guardian that he thinks Ricciardi was testing the cheating system for another player, since the Imperia festival's prize of 1,000 euros ($1,117) seems a poor reward for risking a career.

As the Guardian's Stephen Moss, who has written extensively about the chess world, pointed out, cheating seems to be growing more and more pervasive — and insidious — in recent years. Computers are now capable of beating even the best players, and there are a million ways a crafty cheat can turn that to his or her advantage.

Last December, a 15-year-old girl who left her home before dawn to get to a school on the city's North Side was beaten and raped less than a half block from a Safe Passage route.

"This gun violence has to stop," Leggett said. "It has to. My baby is only 3. How is he shot in the face with an army gun? Where are they getting army guns from?"

CHICAGO — Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel took the oath of office to begin his second term Monday and took the unusual step of focusing his inaugural address on a single issue: The lack of opportunity facing the city's disadvantaged youths.

Second inaugural speeches tend to be trickier for politicians than the first, where the formula often is to highlight an agenda heading into office. For many, the second time around features a mixture of touting accomplishments while ticking off priorities for a second term. Emanuel's decision to draw attention to a single issue is less conventional.

But by focusing on the lack of opportunities in many of the city's minority neighborhoods, and doing it through the lens of the city's youth, Emanuel took on one of the top criticisms lobbed at him during the campaign: He's a mayor who has perpetuated two Chicagos — one for the wealthy and one for the rest.

Heading into Monday's speech, much of the focus had been on Chicago's cratering finances.

Both the city and Chicago Public Schools face $1 billion deficits. The Illinois Supreme Court's ruling this month that public employee retirement benefits may not be diminished once they've been granted has jeopardized two pension deals Emanuel negotiated and makes striking new ones to cover police, firefighters and teachers more difficult.

Ninety-three percent of the splints that are used to immobilize fractured limbs temporarily are not put on correctly, according to the study of pediatric patients in the Baltimore area. That can lead to swelling, skin injuries and other problems — some of them long-term.

But techniques and materials change, Graw said, and people lose skills that they don't use regularly, so updates are important.

"I wonder how many emergency rooms even know this is happening," she said. "You don't see them again. They didn't warn us to look out for blistering or rubbing so maybe they didn't know that was a possibility."

Realizing that thousands of people search online every day for information about their ancestors, Manning published the names under the mystery photos on his webpage.

Cook sent Manning pictures of Blanton as an adult in Shelby, N.C., and he took them to Maureen Taylor, a face-recognition expert he'd relied on in the past. Taylor, called the nation's foremost historical photo detective by The Wall Street Journal, said the faces matched perfectly.

"I never cease to be amazed when I find descendants of people in the photos," said Manning, 72, a retired social worker in Florence, Mass. "I'm not only giving them back their history, but I'm giving the children (in the photos) back their dignity."

"If granny ever mentioned working in a mill, I don't recall," said Cook. "But I do know she was very protective of children, especially little girls. She was determined I would have pretty things — clothes, dolls — all the things she didn't have as a little girl. She spoiled me rotten. She wouldn't let Mother spank me."

ALEPPO, Syria — The prayer room in the 12th-century mosque had the feel of a bachelor pad — cups of tea and coffee and half-full ashtrays covered most surfaces. A lanky teenager named Hussein Mansour plopped himself down and placed a grenade and a small bag of pretzels on the table.

He picked up the grenade again and pretended to pull the ring, looking around for a reaction. A fellow rebel fighter, Abu Musab, paused from sucking on a hookah pipe and gave the 16-year-old a disapproving look.

As hundreds of fatigued rebel fighters desert the ranks of the opposition and many others are killed daily in battles in the Syrian civil war, their positions are increasingly filled by teenagers like Hussein, a boy with an easy grin and light peach fuzz spread along his chin.

Hussein took a break from fiddling with the rifle and motioned to the gun rack beside him. "What do you think these are, anti-aircraft weapons? These are just rifles my 6-year-old brother could shoot."

In a war that has already claimed more than 190,000 lives and each day brings new civilian casualties, boys like Hussein are resigned to a morbid fate one way or another. Most seem to live by the ominous creed often heard in rebel areas: "It's all one death."

MIAMI — It was in early 2014 that federal officials and immigrant rights activists noticed a disturbing trend at the U.S. border with Mexico. Tens of thousands of children were crossing illegally without their parents.

Most of the minors eventually were resettled throughout the country, and a significant number — more than 3,100 — wound up in South Florida.

Now that the exodus has eased, how are the children doing?

"These children don't necessarily have access to health care systems," Herrera said. "They don't have health insurance coverage or medical supervision."

The magnitude-8.3 quake lasted for three minutes, causing buildings to sway in the capital, Santiago, and prompting authorities to issue a tsunami warning for the Andean nation's entire Pacific coast. People sought safety in the streets of inland cities, while others along the shore took to their cars to race to higher ground.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It wasn't careless zookeepers that were responsible for the escape of seven chimpanzees from their Kansas City Zoo enclosure on Thursday afternoon.

That was zoo director Randy Wisthoff's explanation for the unauthorized excursion that prompted a "Code Red" response among zoo employees, an hourlong lockdown of zoo visitors and finally a careful roundup.

WASHINGTON — The federal government moved Tuesday to further protect chimpanzees, proposing to change the animals' endangered status and increase oversight of their use in research.

In its proposal, the Fish and Wildlife Service said there were about 2,000 chimpanzees in captivity in the U.S., and the latest estimates put the worldwide population of the animals at 300,000 to 430,000. Chimps' numbers are threatened, in part by encroaching human development and by hunting. The capture of chimpanzees for the international pet trade also has been one of the causes of the animals' decline, and the proposal noted that killing a female who has an infant earns twice the income for a hunter: The mother's body is sold in the bush-meat trade and the infant enters the pet trade.

When a band of captive chimpanzees was transferred from the Netherlands to Scotland's Edinburgh Zoo in 2010, they used different grunts to refer to apples. Three years later, after the two groups had bonded, they had converged toward a common sound for the fruit, according to the study published online Thursday in the journal Current Biology.

BEIJING - For animal lovers in China, the week seemed to bring one discouraging headline after another.

First, tourists in a southern resort reportedly manhandled a stranded dolphin and took photos with it rather than immediately call for help; the mammal later died.

Then, customs authorities announced they had caught two men trying to smuggle more than 200 bear paws into the country from Russia; the feet are considered a delicacy in some parts of China. On Friday, the southern city of Yulin went ahead with a dog meat festival over the objection of activists. Many complained that the table-bound pups were stolen strays and pets being butchered at unlicensed plants.

It felt like the warriors could have marched faster. What was supposed to be a 100-minute flight last month ended up delayed, diverted and canceled to the point that it took passengers 18 hours to get to Beijing.

Flights here are delayed for pretty much the same reason highways are backed up: Explosive economic growth has produced traffic faster than infrastructure has improved.

The result is that airlines tend to hustle passengers into planes that then pull away from the gate, making it look like the flight is on time. The passengers end up strapped in their seats on the tarmac waiting for a runway — or in flight, circling an airport, wasting fuel and polluting the environment.

If things go as planned, a second child for Luo could be part of a baby boomlet for China. The Chinese Communist Party announced Friday that, as part of a reform package approved at the third party plenum, it would ease the one-child policy to allow couples in which either partner is an only child to have a second baby.

Demographers believe the change — previously, exceptions were made if both parents were only children – will benefit about 10 million couples, including Luo and her husband. She is an only child, but he has a sibling.

Built without nails, its 11 hexagonal tiers stack up like a wedding cake 82 feet tall. Painted roosters, chickens, peacocks and ducks, in bright blues, greens and yellows, dance around the edges, frolicking in trees and bamboo groves. An octagonal two-story turret caps the structure like a fancy stopper on a giant perfume bottle.

In many ways, life in this remote hamlet, perched along the hairpin bend of a river in Guizhou province, seems to have changed little since the tower went up in 1672.

A few other men of similar vintage hovered nearby, one occasionally rising to throw another 5-foot log onto the flames.

"They tried to get us to burn the drum," Shi recalled. "But we wouldn't listen. Imagine what would have happened if we had followed those orders. This tower would be gone."

BEIJING — China is a country with gargantuan environmental problems, deep distrust of government and a population that is increasingly wired through mobile devices. Put that together and it's no surprise that large street protests are breaking out against waste incinerators, chemical plants and other industrial projects.

The latest, in the southern China county of Boluo, in Guangdong province, saw thousands of people march through the streets Saturday, with some returning Sunday, to protest a planned garbage incinerator. Police detained 24 demonstrators, but overall the response was relatively restrained, a sign that Chinese authorities have resigned themselves to occasional environmental blowback.

Disposing of household garbage is becoming an increasing headache for local governments as China's consumer culture expands. China generates about 200 million metric tons of solid waste yearly, and in 2004 it surpassed the United States as the world's largest producer of garbage. By 2030, it is expected to generate twice as much waste as the United States, according to a 2012 report by the World Bank.

Some experts say incinerators are the best way to dispose of this waste, especially in crowded parts of China where landfill space is sparse. Nie Yongfeng, a professor emeritus at the Tsinghua University School of Environment in Beijing, said new incinerators in China operate at or above European Union standards for limiting dioxins and other pollutants. Opponents, he said, rely on old data from earlier incinerators to fan fears about such projects.

Others, however, say the government has been less than transparent in monitoring emissions from big waste burners. "There has been little release of public data, so it is hard to know if the incinerators are being operated safely," said Lin Youzhu, manager of the solid waste program for Friends of Nature, China's oldest environmental group.

Having an operation? Better slip the surgeon some cash. And don't forget the anesthesiologist.

"I'm absolutely disgusted by it, but this is how our system works," said Luo, a 32-year-old math teacher turned activist who is campaigning against what he sees as Chinese society's pervasive culture of corruption.

Gift-giving has long been a staple of Chinese life, but the means and expectations are increasingly colliding with more modern anti-graft strictures.

To highlight the problem of graft in government, Chinese activists have enlarged photographs of officials to zoom in on expensive watches that they would not be expected to afford on civil service salaries that run no more than $850 per month. One mid-level provincial official was discovered by an activist to have a collection of timepieces that included a $62,000 Vacheron Constantin, earning him the nickname "Brother Watch" and a 14-year prison sentence.

Sales at luxury shops in Beijing spike in March, when delegates to the National People's Congress seek to ingratiate themselves with their superiors. Under the law, officials are not supposed to take gifts valued at more than 5,000 yuan, about $820 each. But the law is widely disregarded and unevenly enforced.

BEIJING, China — For the 59-year-old woman from a suburb of Beijing, China, it was a shocker: Visiting her new local graveyard, China Dragon Garden, she said she discovered her own name written in gold letters on a black granite tombstone.

When the woman, identified only by the surname Wang, complained to the cemetery staff, all she got was a runaround, according to a recent report in Beijing's Jinghua Times. With developers selling gravesites at $5,000 to $8,500 apiece, the proprietors are accused of erecting hundreds of graves to apparently give prospective customers the illusion that the facility was popular, boosting shoppers' confidence to buy a plot.

Wang recently went to court, complaining that developers had maligned her name and her family's reputation. Three of her relatives also had fake graves at the site, she said. She is seeking an apology and $16,000 in compensation for emotional distress.

Burials are a contentious and lucrative business in China these days. The country of more than 1.3 billion sees about 10 million deaths a year. Rising land prices and an aging population have crimped space for graves and driven up the cost of plots to the point that many Chinese complain, only half-jokingly, that it's too expensive to die.

"People in my hometown always say it's colder in your home than outside in winter," recalled Tan, 31, who now lives in Beijing. "When I came home, I had to change into warmer clothes. After taking off my winter jacket, I had to put on very thick and padded pajamas. My Nike sneakers were not warm enough to be used at home, I always had to change into boots with furs inside, like those Ugg boots."

On Saturday, and every Nov. 15, people who live in apartment complexes in Beijing, Harbin and hundreds of other cities north of the boundary will rejoice as government central heating plants are fired up, flooding warmth into homes for four months. Those who live south of the line — even by a mile — will suffer the season with nary a puff of steam from a radiator.

BEIJING — The Chinese Communist Party operates out of a vast walled-off compound, known as Zhongnanhai, near Beijing's Forbidden City. It is here that party leaders oversee the Great Firewall — China's 24-hour control of the Internet.

Some 5,900 miles away, in a cottage in Berkeley, California, the staff of China Digital Times tries to poke holes in the Great Firewall. Every day, they collect, translate and publish many of the censorship directives the party sends to state media. They aggregate breaking news deemed "sensitive" by China's rulers and highlight the code words Chinese people invent to get around the censors.

In a typical posting, China Digital Times reported Wednesday that censors have instructed media not to play up coverage of recent explosions at a factory that produces paraxylene, a highly toxic chemical.

BEIJING — China has pledged to end the processing and sale of ivory, a move that — if fulfilled — would be a major victory in the battle to end the slaughter of tens of thousands of African elephants by poachers every year. But it has not said how quickly it will act, and a top Chinese official called on the United States in an interview last week to also tighten its rules on ivory trading.

Cristian Samper, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, said Meng's remarks should be "broadcast around the world, and should put all poachers on notice that their bloody market is no longer viable."

"There is clearly a senior level of commitment from the Chinese government to stop the ivory industry in China," he said. "Now, Chinese government agencies responsible for regulating and managing the ivory issue will need to develop a plan and a timeline to implement this decision. And people from all nations need to stop buying ivory."

Although stricter enforcement has helped reduce poaching and populations are growing in some nations, Tanzania and Mozambique have each lost half or more of their elephants in the past five years. There have also been big declines in forest elephant populations in central Africa.

WEIFANG, China — Zhang Xiaodong's workshop is strewn with all manner of flying contraptions. There are dragons, eagles, butterflies and ingenious mechanical kites, including one that features a frog seeking to devour a praying mantis.

Zhang, 65, is one of China's most revered kite makers, and as he showed off some of his life's work, he ticked off the benefits of lofting wind-blown art into the sky.

"Flying a kite also elevates your mood. You can write your worries on the kite, and when it soars high in the air, you can cut the string and your worries will fly away."

Chinese kite makers have much to worry about these days. As China modernizes, a new generation is playing video games instead of attaching painted silk to bamboo frames. The artisans that remain are rapidly aging. Nearly all of them are men in a nation of almost 1.4 billion people.

Han Fuling is one who obeyed Mao Zedong's strictures, making kites that pictured workers instead of ancient mythic figures. Even so, he has bitter memories of what he calls "the 10 years of upheaval."

Sun's living room has the faint scent of bamboo and paint. Its walls are filled with mementos of old China: kites, photographs, paintings and huzi — twisted gourds that have deep symbolism in Chinese mythology. Sun said his fascination with the past started with his grandfather, who taught him the old accents and ways of Beijing, including Beijing opera.

"That is the problem we face. People don't have the sentimental attachment to traditional kites," he said. "They rarely fly them. They buy the triangles (plastic commercial kites) and fly them at the bridges."

BEIJING — In hope of ensuring that the next man on the moon is Chinese, Beijing launched a rocket early Monday carrying a buggy-like vehicle that is expected to roam and explore the lunar surface for three months.

The Long March rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan province at its scheduled time of 1:30 a.m. Monday, Beijing time (12:30 p.m. EST Sunday), the official Xinhua news agency reported.

If all goes as planned, a landing vehicle and the rover will touch down on the moon's surface in about two weeks. It would be the first soft landing (one in which the vehicle remains intact) on the moon since 1976, when the Soviet Union landed the Luna 24 probe.

The unmanned rover is a gold-colored vehicle that looks like a dune buggy. It is expected to conduct scientific projects such as planting a telescope on the moon's surface, exploring under the surface of the moon and transmitting photographs back to Earth.

The real purpose, aerospace experts believe, is to gain expertise to eventually put a man on the moon.

Since the burst of moon exploration in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the 1969 landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the moon's appeal has waned in favor of planets and asteroids. In 2010, President Obama axed plans for the Constellation program that was supposed to return Americans to the moon by 2020.

BEIJING — For many Americans, Chinese New Year conjures up images of colorful parades and fireworks in celebrations at quaint Chinatowns across the United States.

In China, "bittersweet" is the word the government-controlled media often use in regard to the Lunar New Year festival, which starts Friday. The holiday is when Chinese workers are expected to return to their home villages and share time and gifts with their families and friends. Given that hundreds of millions have moved from rural areas to cities in recent decades, Chinese New Year has become a frenzied time of travel across the world's most populous country. Some call it "the world's largest human migration."

It was an astounding finding. Beijing is reportedly home to 8 million migrant workers, more than a third of its population. Most of them are young men from neighboring or far-flung provinces who moved here to take factory or service jobs, often living in squalid and crowded conditions.

They schlep by bus, train and plane to more than a dozen cities from late December to mid-January, offering up crowd-pleasing medleys from movies such as "Titanic," "Dances With Wolves," "The Incredibles" and "The Godfather." To save on travel expenses, the group doesn't lug around large instruments such as drums, upright basses or even cellos; local promoters in each town provide them.

In many cities of Xinjiang, the latest outdoors craze is parkour — a training regimen that started in France and has gone viral worldwide. Imagine groups of young people jumping, vaulting and flipping in the air, often using whatever structures they can find — ranging from park benches to rooftops.

But unrest in Xinjiang isn't limited to Uighurs influenced by extremist ideology. Some are angry at Chinese restrictions on their dress and appearance — such as men wearing beards. Others skoff at propaganda posters, visible all over Xinjiang, that portray the Chinese Communist Party as a unifying force for ethnic harmony.

The research, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences by four economists in China, the U.S. and Israel, examined air-quality readings collected in 90 Chinese cities from 1981 to 2000 and compared those with mortality data collected at 145 locations across the country from 1991 to 2000.

SHANGHAI — Zhang Mei Lian is worried about her 16-year-old son. Worried that he's falling behind his female classmates in school. Worried that he isn't athletic enough, that he doesn't know how to repair things, such as computers or a broken light. Worried that, in short, he doesn't know how to be a man.

"Our current education system is really bad for boys," Zhang said. "Boys should be strong. Otherwise, they are all turning into some kind of feminized boys. Boys should be acting like boys."

Zhang isn't the only one who's concerned about the masculinity of young Chinese men. Much as in some segments of the United States, where boys' falling academic achievement has been the subject of a host of studies, China is worried about whether rapid social change is leaving boys behind.

"We tend to describe it as the feminization of men or lack of manliness," said Li Wendao, the co-author of a book titled "Save the Boys." "Society is concerned because if the issue is not resolved, its influence will be big on society's development."

A substantial overlay of cultural conflict colors the concerns. Some people here blame the popularity of television shows and movies from South Korea that portray men as skinny with beautifully delicate features for changing notions of masculinity.

BEIJING — When China landed its first lunar rover on the moon last month, many Americans reacted with a shrug. After all, the U.S. sent men to the moon more than 40 years ago, and the Soviets landed a rover there too.

Wally Wang, deputy general manager at Keer America, believes more Chinese textile companies and other manufacturers will follow Keer to the United States.

That would be welcomed in Lancaster County, where the pain of lost textile jobs still resonates.

Springs Mills in Lancaster once employed close to 20,000 people, but in 2007, the last South Carolina textile factory closed. Springs Global reports it employs fewer than 450 in four South Carolina locations that handle warehouse, distribution and services.

A company called AquaBounty has been seeking for more than 20 years to win FDA approval to bring a genetically modified fast-growing salmon to supermarkets. While the AquAdvantage salmon and the GloFish have been engineered to incorporate genes from other fish, the technique used by BGI to create its micro pigs is different and presents a new question for regulatory agencies like the FDA if they were to be imported to the United States.

Pigs are technically food animals, said Max Rothschild, an agriculture professor at Iowa State University, and the FDA reserves the right to regulate any genetic modification introduced into such organisms. But in sharp contrast to genetically modified organisms with DNA added into their genomes, he said, the micro pig was made by removing just a few, highly targeted letters of DNA from its own genome.

Yet more and more professional Chinese women say they just can't find a man who is as accomplished as they are. Others say that after years of schooling, they want to enjoy their freedom past age 27, widely seen here as the proper time to settle down.

Branded — a bit derogatorily — as shengnu, or "leftover women," many of these educated, urban singles are coming under intense pressure to marry. Parents fear that their daughters will end up childless and lonely, economically vulnerable spinsters in a society that lacks the social safety net communism once promised.

It's not just mom and dad who want their grown daughters to find a spouse. Government agencies, academics and even some businesses are treating shengnu as the source of potentially serious social problems.

They've warned that if the ranks of such women expand, they could exacerbate population imbalances, lure married men into affairs and drive down real estate sales. (Home-buying, after all, is usually part and parcel of marriage here.)

For singles like Xie, it's become almost impossible to go about daily life without being reminded of one's marital status.

If it's not a call with the parents, it's a flier or email promoting a "marriage expo" or other matchmaking event. (A city-backed expo in Shanghai two months ago drew 20,000 people.) Turn on the TV and you can watch "The Price of Being a Shengnu," "Go, Go, Shengnu," "Even Shengnu Get Crazy" — all with similar plotlines: Smart, beautiful, successful women try everything to get a man.

"Shengnu are being demonized," said Sandra Bao, who founded a social group called Leftover Attitude in Shanghai to support unmarried professional women. "Parents are pressuring us, the media label us, there's a whole industry of matchmakers and others out there telling us it's a problem to be single."

Leta Hong Fincher, a doctoral candidate at Tsinghua University who has studied the issue, said the high marriage rate for Chinese women results in large part from the government's "remarkably effective propaganda campaign" stigmatizing shengnu.

"Because the leftover women thing has been pushed so aggressively, a lot of women have internalized this ideology," Fincher said. "They are really afraid they are not going to find a husband if they wait too long."

Sun Peidong, a sociologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, said the phenomenon also reflects China's move toward a market economy.

"The public is experiencing unprecedented relaxation and freedom, especially in the field of marriage, family and sex," she said. At the same time, "the change of policies on housing, medical, education and many other aspects of social security means that ordinary people are forced to depend on themselves. … Parents worry about their and their children's future."

SHANGHAI — For two days, Rocky had been playing video games in the tiny apartment he shares with three other men in Shanghai, a city of 23 million. He left only once, to buy food. The games "help me relax," he said. "It helps me escape. I feel so tired."

In June, the 32-year-old quit his job as a salesman with a traditional Chinese medicine company. His monthly wage was a meager $400. Rocky has had nearly a dozen jobs since he graduated from college a decade ago. His mother, who lived in a poor village in Shandong, a province a few hours north of Shanghai by train, died in May.

"I feel so guilty. She worked so hard to try to give me everything, and I could never do anything for her," said Rocky, who requested that only his English name be used because he's embarrassed by his poverty. "I feel so lost. I am such a loser. There is such a huge gap between my reality and my dreams. I feel so old."

Rocky is part of a generation in China known as the post-'80s. Born in the 1980s, they've seen rapid change as China moved from a Maoist state to a market-oriented economy characterized by rampant consumerism and unprecedented inequality. Because of the country's one-child policy, many of them are only children. They're the first generation to grow up with the Internet, and in turn, have had more access to information — and perhaps greater exposure to individual censorship.

"Our childhood was very pure and simple," Xia said. "When we grow up, the changes that took place happened overnight. Everybody feels so anxious and doesn't know what to do. We can't escape an environment where everyone talks about money." Wang Wei, 27, who works for a local government in Nantong, a coastal city near Shanghai, had a similar downcast view.

"I don't think the situation will get better," she said. At night, she works a shift at a Kentucky Fried Chicken to help make ends meet. She said she couldn't get a promotion in her government work because "it is very clear that those who get promotions all have family connections. Opportunities are not really fair for capable people." "All we can do is accept the way things are," she said.

The vessel capsized in the storm Monday night with 458 people aboard, touching off a frantic rescue effort. At least 15 people were brought to safety, including three pulled from the overturned hull Tuesday, and five people were confirmed dead, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

The vessel was carrying mostly elderly tourists from Nanjing to the southwestern city of Chongqing when it overturned in China's Hubei province.

Divers rescued a 65-year-old woman and, later, two men who had been trapped, state broadcaster CCTV reported. It said more people had been found and were being rescued, but did not say whether they were still inside the overturned hull.

CCTV video showed rescuers in orange life vests climbing on the hull, with one of them lying down tapping a hammer and listening for a response, then gesturing downward.

The survivors included the ship's captain and chief engineer, both of whom were taken into police custody, CCTV said. Relatives who gathered in Shanghai, where many of the tourists started their journey by bus, questioned whether the captain did enough to ensure the passengers' safety and demanded answers from local officials in unruly scenes that drew a heavy police response.

Xinhua quoted the captain and the chief engineer as saying the four-level Eastern Star sank quickly after being caught in what they described as a cyclone. The Communist Party-run People's Daily said the ship sank within two minutes.

The overturned ship had drifted almost 2 miles downstream before coming to rest close to shore, where fast currents made the rescue difficult.

The fact that the capsized ship drifted downstream was a good sign for rescuers because it meant there was enough air inside to give it buoyancy, and could mean there were enough air pockets for survivors, said Park Chi-mo, a professor of naval architecture and ocean engineering at South Korea's Ulsan University.

CCTV said the vessel had been carrying 406 Chinese passengers, five travel agency employees and a crew of 47. The broadcaster said most of the passengers were 50 to 80 years old.

Less well-known is that for more than 60 years, the United States officially excluded an entire ethnic group — Chinese immigrants.

The Chinese Exclusion Act, as it came to be known, was passed by Congress in 1882 and was not lifted until 1943, when politicians acted partly out of embarrassment over the fact that China was a U.S. ally in World War II.

In the 1920s, Yee said, it was common for Chinese families to send one son abroad to earn money to send back to China, and her father took on that role. Fung, who had grown up in Guangdong, catered to what Americans thought of as Chinese food in those years, mostly chop suey and chow mein. Only later did he add Cantonese dishes, egg rolls and other menu items.

One of his first hires was a waitress, Lorraine Kristoff, whose family was from Hungary, and "she said she knew two weeks after she met him that she was going to marry him," Yee said.

When the exclusion act was first passed for a 10-year period, he said, 30 percent of Congress voted against it. After it was renewed and then made permanent in 1902, only one senator — George Frisbie Hoar, an outspoken Republican from Massachusetts — was willing to vote against the law. "All races, all colors, all nationalities contain persons entitled to be recognized everywhere as equals of other men," he said. "I am bound to record my protest, if I stand alone."

One result of the exclusion act was that Chinese-American men who were able to go back and forth between China and the U.S. would often start families in China and then not see them for years at a time. When the law was finally lifted in the 1940s, its chief benefit was not just to allow new Chinese immigrants, but also to give existing Chinese residents — and their families — the right to live together and become citizens in the U.S., Daniels said.

BEIJING — When Ma Wenfeng was a boy, his father earned so little money growing wheat and corn that the family mainly ate mantou, a steamed bread that is a staple of the poor. The last thing he would have dreamed of was becoming a farmer.

Now it is his greatest ambition to start a farm, but not in China, a country where the very word for "farmer," nongmin, is synonymous with "peasant." Many Chinese farmers are long past retirement age but still tilling tiny, inefficient plots of land.

"We're the world's fastest-growing economy, with a huge demand for agricultural products," said Ma, who works as an analyst for a Beijing-based trade association, CnAgri. "When we look overseas, we see large tracts of land where you can operate a farm that makes sense economically."

"We want to bring American sunshine, land and water back to China," said Zhang Renwu, a businessman who owns two farms in Utah growing alfalfa to feed dairy cows.

Chinese companies are acquiring farmland where they can — many countries ban the sale of land to foreigners — or forming partnerships with farming enterprises overseas.

When China's largest pork producer, Shuanghui International Holdings, last year paid $4.7 billion for its U.S. counterpart, Smithfield Foods Inc., it also acquired more than 100,000 acres of farmland in Missouri, Texas and North Carolina. (Virginia-based Smithfield didn't disclose how much farmland was covered by the purchase, but just one subsidiary had reported it owned more than 100,000 acres in the three states.)

LOS ANGELES — When Alisha Chen first got into real estate 10 years ago, she didn't really plan on becoming a gatekeeper for a global housing market.

But a housing crash and a flood of Chinese money later, she's part of a growing cottage industry of real estate agents, bankers and attorneys who specialize in helping wealthy foreigners buy a little patch of Southern California.

BEIJING — A Peking duck dinner might inspire a twinge of guilt about indulging in some decadent, fatty fowl. But health-conscious diners at the high-end Da Dong restaurant chain here in the Chinese capital can at least rationalize that they did a little weightlifting before their meal.

That's because the menus at Da Dong are heftier than a small gym dumbbell — 5 pounds, 4 ounces, to be exact. Measuring 20 inches tall, 15 inches wide and more than an inch thick, the 140-page menu outweighs National Geographic's Global Atlas.

Packed with rich color photos, the volume is divided into chapters with sumptuous red-and-white calligraphy paper. The brown binding bears the restaurant's name, and a table of contents listing about 200 dishes runs four pages. And diners are handed two other menus: a selection of seasonal items (24 pages) and a wine list (a relatively svelte 19 pages).

Da Dong's massive menu may be among the most eye-popping in town, but it's hardly alone in its heftiness or artistic ambition. Even as a trend toward in-season and locally grown food has helped shrink the list of dishes at many au courant establishments in the United States and Europe in recent years, transforming their bills of fare into single-sheet affairs printed daily on ordinary paper, high-end restaurateurs in China have been supersizing.

Middle-8th in Beijing, specializing in dishes from Yunnan province, employs a 128-page, 3-pound carte. At Pure Lotus, a pricey vegetarian hideaway, customers contend with a golden-paged volume stretching 2 1/2 feet wide and weighing 4 pounds, 5 ounces; and if that isn't enough, the nine-course $133 tasting menu is carved into an inch-thick wooden plank, also 2 1/2 feet wide. Countless run-of-the-mill restaurants offer customers menus as large and colorful as American high school yearbooks.

Now, his mega-menus are made once a year at a top printing house in Shenzhen, and theft is way down, "though we did have one person come in with a suitcase and manage to get one that way," said Dong, who will occasionally sell last season's menus for $200 to those who really want to take one home.

LOS ANGELES — Yosemite High School once offered six woodshop classes. Now there are three.

Things got worse when a new high school opened in a neighboring district and many students transferred. Campus enrollment is down from 1,100 five years ago to about 700 today.

School officials are now looking to a faraway place for salvation. As soon as next fall, Yosemite High could welcome 25 students from China who would pay $10,000 or more in tuition to enjoy an American public education amid mountain scenery. They would boost revenue and inject an international flavor into a school with few immigrant families.

Two tuition-paying Chinese students are at Yosemite High this year. Xiao "Travis" Ma of Inner Mongolia plays clarinet in the marching band, and Chengyu "Johnny" Zhang of Shanghai runs on the cross-country team. Though the local Chinese cuisine is not to their satisfaction, they appreciate the clean air and the elbow room.

"Having students who pay tuition helps keep some of our programs more full," said Stephanie Samuels, a guidance counselor and international coordinator at Yosemite High. "We don't have a lot of exposure to other cultures. Our students benefit not only from the academic challenge but from meeting people from other parts of the world."

The rapid, largely unregulated growth in F-1 visa students, as they are known, has raised concerns about the role of private recruiting companies and the safety of teenagers in the country without their parents. The companies, which typically collect thousands of dollars in fees from each student, are knocking on school districts' doors, looking to form partnerships.

WASHINGTON — On his first day of teaching Chinese in a Bradenton, Florida, middle school, Xu Dou showed his students the old forms of Chinese characters, so they could see how the writing has changed over millennia.

He said he'd explained to his class that Chinese characters were an indispensable part of Chinese tradition: "I tell them if you want to learn real Chinese, you have to learn how to write Chinese characters."

That will take a lot of memorization and practice, but Xu's students already have a good start. Many began learning Chinese two years earlier as students at Wakeland Elementary School, where Li Meng, another newly arrived teacher, is working this year.

U.S. government officials say Chinese is one of the languages that is essential for U.S. economic and strategic interests, but the federal government has halted much of the funding for K-12 language learning.

LOS ANGELES — Theme park designer Edward Marks and his team of ride developers and artists have dreamed up some of the country's most thrilling attractions — high-tech dark rides, glow-in-the-dark parades and 3-D simulators teeming with mummies, aliens and crazy clowns.

But to cash in on China's theme park boom, Marks is learning that they need more than a creative vision. They must become experts on local folklore and cultural superstitions, and arm themselves with an ample supply of patience.

Chinese have smoked tobacco for centuries, and up until the early 1900s women regularly could be seen with men puffing on pipes. But with the advent of cigarettes, Chinese intellectuals and foreign missionaries started frowning on women who smoked. According to Carol Benedict's book "Golden-Silk Smoke: A History of Tobacco in China, 1550-2010," society started to describe female smokers as "modern women," a label also given to the promiscuous and unpatriotic.

As a result, women quit smoking, even as Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping smoked openly in public, encouraging the habit among men.

More than 200 years after that first contact, the five tribes that now make up the Chinook Indian Nation have a constitution, a tribal council and annual meetings. They are not, however, recognized by the U.S. government.

The Chinook tribes' lack of recognition could change under proposed revisions to the 35-year process the U.S. Interior Department uses to officially recognize [Indian tribes](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Native+American). Announced May 22, they are part of an effort the department says will make tribal recognition more efficient and transparent.

The BIA will hold hearings in July for federally recognized tribes and the public to comment on the proposed changes.
CHONGQING, China — When the air-raid alarms sounded, people hid in the shelters. They ran for the caves dug into the mountains. But there were never enough hiding places from the Japanese bombs, and not enough for Chen Guifang's parents.

On May 4, 1939, 7-year-old Chen was huddled inside a crowded cave in Chongqing — China's wartime capital in its southern interior — when bombs rained down outside. Shrapnel rocketed everywhere, wounding Chen and killing both of her parents.

Collier is leaving the Boy Scouts of America for Trail Life USA, a conservative Christian alternative to the Boy Scouts that will start chartering its first troops at the end of September.

Collier will be among those starting a Trail Life troop, which he said one day will include his son, who's now 4 years old.

"I'm glad I am building something my son can enjoy from next year to when he's 18," said Collier, a 41-year-old utilities field manager from Windermere. "I left the BSA because they compromised their own belief system. Trail Life USA is going to stick to the standards that the BSA abandoned."

Stephens views Trail Life as a desperate and futile escape to a past that no longer exists.

KERDASA, Egypt — Nearly three months after nearby residents looted and burned the Archangel Michael church, Rida Gaballah, 49, one of the six people who tried to stave off thousands of attackers, stood among the ruins.

The Egyptian government vowed to rebuild the church, one of 74 destroyed in the first three months after the military ousted Mohammed Morsi from the presidency July 3. But work has yet to begin here, leaving the church as a monument to the violence brought by Morsi's Islamist supporters — and to the government's failure to protect historic Egyptian institutions.

TRENTON, N.J. — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie issued a statement Monday saying he "reluctantly" signed a bill that prohibits attempts to convert children from gay to straight.

The governor's banning of conversion therapy comes as he runs for re-election in New Jersey this year and as he positions himself for a possible presidential campaign in 2016. His past comments set him apart from the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, which holds that homosexuality is a sin and is a choice.

Garden State Equality, a group that supports gay rights, issued a statement Monday praising Christie's decision to sign the bill.

LIVINGSTON, N.J. — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie opened his 2016 campaign for president Tuesday and, never one to aim small, declared he's "out to change the world."

Now, Christie has been eclipsed by others in a pack of more than a dozen rivals. And his poll numbers at home have sunk to record lows. New Jersey's economy is lagging and there have been nine credit downgrades on Christie's watch.

And then it was back to work, as if nothing had happened. No mention of the procedure at an event in Lavallette, New Jersey, two days after the surgery or at any of the other meetings Christie held that week.

"If I had a choice, I wouldn't have ever talked about it," Christie said on Tuesday, confirming a news report that detailed his surgery nearly three months ago.

How much weight he has lost, how much he weighs now, and how much he plans to lose were all questions Christie said he would not answer, saying they are nobody's business and calling the media attention "ridiculous" and "silly."

The Irving-based Chuck E. Cheese's chain this week completed the nationwide rollout of the biggest change to its menu in more than a decade, officials said in an interview this week. The change is meant in part to reduce the vetoes from parents craving more sophisticated tastes.

New offerings include California Alfredo thin and crispy pizza with mushrooms and spinach and, for a limited time, New York-style cheesecake.

"When you think about Chuck E. Cheese's, you certainly do think about kids entertainment upfront as well as pizza," said Leverton, chief executive of the parent company, CEC Entertainment Inc. "We see an opportunity to further improve … on providing menu offerings that entice the adults more to agree to take their children to Chuck E. Cheese's.

The fires also ignited an online army of activists who coalesced during the street protests in Ferguson, Mo., and who have become a kind of rapid-deployment force for black America. Their passion for justice and skepticism of investigators' accounts have been a regular presence after police shootings.

This week, their focus has been on church fires. But investigators say only two of the six blazes have been confirmed as arsons, not one has been declared a hate crime and they are not connected.

"We are in the early stages of these investigations, but at this time we have no reason to believe these fires are racially motivated or related," the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a statement.

Some data suggest the number of church fires may not be that unusual. But as with police shootings after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, each church incident is getting extra scrutiny.

"Stop the passive language. Fires aren't 'breaking out' at black churches. Black churches are being set on fire," one person tweeted.

"At what point are we allowed to say black America is under attack?" tweeted another.

"If the government watched the KKK as hard as they do #BlackLivesMatter, maybe we would know #WhoIsBurningBlackChurches," tweeted a third.

Each remark earned hundreds of retweets.



Their concerns were backed by the NAACP's president, Cornell William Brooks.

"The spike in church burnings in Southern states over the past few days requires our collective attention," especially after the June 17 slayings in Charleston, he said in a statement Wednesday.

"When nine students of Scripture lose their lives in a house of worship, we cannot turn a blind eye to any incident," Brooks said.

"As we wait for authorities to conduct their investigations, the NAACP and our state conferences across the country will remain vigilant and work with local churches and local law enforcement to ensure that all are taking the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of every parishioner," Brooks said, adding, "We will use every tool in our advocacy arsenal to preserve these beloved institutions."

The alarm echoes concerns raised in the 1990s when a surge of church arsons — especially against black churches in the South — led to tougher arson laws and creation of a church arson task force made up of federal and local officials.

Of 827 arsons, bombings or attempted bombings at religious buildings that the National Church Arson Task Force investigated between 1995 and 1999, at least 269 involved black churches, 185 of them in the South.

That ugly time remained fresh in the mind of Greeleyville, S.C., Mayor Jessie Parker, who visited the smoldering remains of the city's Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church on Wednesday after a fire destroyed the sanctuary the night before.

Twenty years ago, Ku Klux Klan members burned Mount Zion AME. Then-President Bill Clinton toured the church after it was rebuilt and said, "We cannot let someone come into our democratic home, the home of our faith, and start torching our houses of worship."

On Wednesday, Parker urged patience as investigators worked to determine the cause of the latest fire. "It gives you an ill feeling," he told reporters. "It brought back all those old memories."

Whether the recent fires are part of a backlash to the national mood since Charleston is unclear.

Sometimes, the stricken churches are old and maintained by volunteers instead of professionals. Steeples present a high-profile target for lightning. And cooking implements may have been left on after parishioners and clergy left the building.

In 2011, the U.S. saw an average of about five arsons a week, according to the fire association's data — a rather large number of church and funeral home attacks that have received little national media attention.

The culprits often are teenagers and the fires are small, said Marty Ahrens, senior manager of fire analysis services for the association.

"For some people, places of worship, maybe they're like schools: a place of authority for kids" to target, Ahrens said. "Some of the arsons are just plain vandalism."

So are the recent black church fires a trend? Or are the media just paying more attention?

"It's hard to know," Ahrens said, adding that the media could contribute to the problem.

"Right now, I am afraid that there is the potential for copycats," he said. "I understand that you need to tell stories and publicize news, but there is a type of individual that can be motivated by doing something that gets wide coverage."
NEW YORK — There are bugs in the trees. There are bugs on the shrubs, on screen doors, on barbecue grills, on front steps. There are shells of bugs on the ground, crunchy as tempura, and bug bodies clinging onto leaves, their dead orange eyes still beady.

"I love them; it's nature," said Kempf, a Staten Island resident who recently collected 300 bugs in a cooler to bring to his yard, in the hope they would multiply. "It's only once in 17 years, you have to enjoy it while they're here."

He is describing Brood II, a population of the cicada species that descends on parts of the East Coast every 17 years. The bugs emerge to emit a high-pitched screech that sounds a bit like a malfunctioning white noise machine, to mate with abandon, and then to die, leaving their eggs on twigs that fall to the ground, allowing tiny nymphs to crawl into dirt holes and live another 17 years, when the cycle repeats.

Though Brood II sightings have stretched from North Carolina to Connecticut, the insects aren't found much in New York City, except for Staten Island. That allows the city's least populated borough to spend a few weeks in the spotlight, if a weird one. It is estimated that, during the short time the cicadas are above ground, there are about 600 bugs to every human on Staten Island. On some blocks, the noise rises above the whir of air conditioners, the blare of radios and the screams of small children who don't like insects.

Of course, now that the bugs are well into the cycle of mating, laying their eggs and dying, people like Ray Matarazzo, whose home in Great Kills, Staten Island, is infested with the bugs, have something new to deal with.

Now, their corpses are beginning to pile up. The smell — well, Matarazzo likens it to that of a dirty, wet dog.

But others, like Joseph Saye, 22, said younger smokers will be able to find ways around the law. Saye, a smoker since he was 19, said he doubts an older age requirement would have much effect.

DUBLIN — Ireland, ground zero in the battle against smoking, and the U.K. are firing the first shots in Europe's latest war on tobacco, one that may ultimately end up being fought by lawyers.

"I'm all for progress," said Booker's neighbor Joyce Cooks. "But I don't want to live on a farm. I'm a city girl."

Along the way, they're pushing cities to be more welcoming to families. Parents in cities across the country, including Seattle, Minneapolis and Denver, are banding together to advocate for new downtown schools, more playgrounds and more affordable family-friendly housing.

"The benefit of living in the city so far outweighed what we would get by moving out to the suburbs," said Jenny Kelly, 32, a marketing consultant who helped form a parents group in 2013, now called Parents for a Better Downtown Seattle.

Lindsey Carillo, 31, grew up in a suburb of Detroit but wanted to expose her kids to city living. "It gives them a different way of living," said the mother of two kids, who are 8 and 1. "I want my kids to have a cultured experience growing up."

NEW YORK — To many in New York City, the rats are winning.

The city's complaint hotline is on pace for a record year of rat calls, exceeding the more than 24,000 over each of the last two years. Blistering audits have faulted efforts to fight what one official called a "rat crisis." And even jaded New Yorkers were both disgusted and a little impressed by "Pizza Rat," the plucky rodent in a recent viral YouTube clip seen dragging a large cheese slice down a subway stairwell.

The vintage-looking trolley cars produced at TIG/m Modern Street Railways are crammed with high-tech machinery and modern materials — except for the wheel system, which is cheaper to scavenge from old vehicles than to build from scratch. One source is a streetcar graveyard deep in a Pennsylvania forest.

Read was president of Transportation Innovations Group, which built the double-decker trolley that travels from a Los Angeles-area shopping center to the farmers market next door.

That trolley "was the prototype for everything we are doing here at TIG/m," said Read, who grew up in Cleveland, where his father was a metallurgist and manager for Republic Steel.

"This has been building for a long time," said Ted McConnell, executive director of the Campaign for the Civic Mission of Schools, a civics learning coalition co-chaired by former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. McConnell said he and others are wary that legislators are only skimming the surface of what students need to know.

"The leaders in the civics education field I've spoken about this with are generally concerned that this exam does not capture the full breadth and scope of the competencies and outcomes we're looking for students to develop," Baumann said.

The U.S. citizenship test requirement also comes amid a larger debate over concerns that testing required under No Child Left Behind and other laws has resulted in a narrowing of the curriculum — taking away time from instruction in topics like civics. One Center for Education Policy study found that 27 percent of districts surveyed reported reducing time on social studies either somewhat or to a great extent.
Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., the only living speaker from the 1963 march, fired up Saturday's crowd by exhorting them to fight against the Supreme Court's decision last June that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

"I gave a little blood on that bridge in Selma, Ala.," he told the crowd, referring to the 1965 "Bloody Sunday" march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in which protestors were brutally beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge. "I got arrested 40 times during the '60s, beaten and left bloodied and unconscious . . . But I'm not tired. I am ready to fight and continue to fight, and you must fight." Attorney General Eric Holder echoed his sentiments, saying Saturday's event was "about far more than reflecting on our past."

Many young people and adults wore T-shirts or buttons, or carried signs protesting the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. Vendors hawked March on Washington anniversary paraphernalia, goods with Trayvon Martin's likeness, and buttons and T-shirts signifying President Barack Obama's two elections.

Emma Daniels, 70, wore a cap adorned with buttons from the 1963 march. Standing under a shady tree with her family, Daniels pointed to where she and other members of Augusta, Ga.'s Tabernacle Baptist Church stood 50 years ago when they made the bus journey to Washington.

Mayfield wrote and sang on a string of message-oriented Impressions singles, including "Keep on Pushing" and "People Get Ready." Cooke delivered the yearning "A Change is Gonna Come," and there was also Little Milton's "We're Gonna Make It," Oscar Brown Jr.'s searing "Driva Man" with Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln, Nina Simone's "Mississippi Goddam," and the defiant, repurposed spirituals and folk songs of the Freedom Singers.

Bernard Lafayette recalled how during the lunch counter sit-ins, Nashville police would just stand by as he and other protesters were attacked. He said he hopes programs like the one at the library will help new recruits better understand their roles as protectors and the trust bestowed on them.

Several miles away, "Ten Cent" Bill Yopp was trying to find his footing. Born a slave, he spent the war as a Confederate drummer, shining boots for a dime and tending to the wounds of his master, Capt. Thomas McCall Yopp.

KENOSHA, Wis. — Inside a building next to Lake Michigan, the Civil War is still in action: cannons boom, smoke wafts across a battlefield and men in blue and gray run screaming at each other.

America's Civil War pitted brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor, Northerner against Southerner, and by the time the conflict ended, hundreds of thousands were dead or maimed. Only Civil War veterans knew the fear and chaos of battle, but shortly after the war ended, painters began to re-create those hellish scenes in round cycloramas for curious visitors seeking a taste of war.

The idea is popular with parents and politicians alike — at least 40 states have carried out some kind of class-size reduction in the past 15 years.

Researchers generally agree that smaller classes, at least in the earliest grades, are linked to positive educational benefits such as better test scores, fewer dropouts and higher graduation rates, especially for disadvantaged children.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Sometimes you grab a cello, only to realize it has grabbed you back. Sometimes you pick up a violin and find it has picked you up out of your old life and shown you a new one. Justice Crawford and Nathaniel Nitkin have begun to figure this out.

In the United States, sipping water, brushing your teeth and taking a shower are all things we take for granted as harmless, healthy habits. But what if doing any of those things could make you sick – sick enough to die?

For an estimated 800 million people living in the developing world, that fear is a reality because they do not have ready access to safe, uncontaminated water. About 3.4 million people die each year from water-related diseases, according to the group Water.org.

Petronella Muelula is one of the 354 million people living in Africa without access to clean drinking water. Petronella is the mother of eight children and lives in rural Zambia – a landlocked country on the continent. Although Petronella and her family live surrounded by water on an island in the middle of Lake Bangweulu, her children risk getting sick every time they drink the lake's water. The lake is contaminated, partly because it is being used as a dump for raw sewage. The polluted water not only causes illness, but it also leads to an inability to grow food, build houses and function in everyday life, which contributes to poverty.

Diarrheal disease saps the body of water and salts necessary for survival and causes victims to slowly lose their ability to absorb nutrients. Death from diarrheal disease is caused by severe dehydration and fluid loss. Only pneumonia causes more preventable childhood deaths in the world. Diarrheal disease kills more children every year than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.

"Before we had (this well) we had many child (in our village) with diarrhea," Petronella told Watson. "But at this moment it is controlled."

The news trifecta of James moving back to his hometown Cavaliers, hotshot college quarterback Johnny Manziel signing with the NFL's beleaguered Cleveland Browns, and the Republican Party picking Cleveland for its 2016 national convention may have put the city in the spotlight in recent days, but locals say all of it is simply more proof there's a Cleveland resurgence underway.

Two other high-profile police-involved deaths still hang over the city: that of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy who was carrying a pellet gun at a playground when he was fatally shot by a white rookie patrolman Nov. 22, 2014, and that of 37-year-old Tanisha Anderson, a mentally ill woman who died of positional asphyxiation after officers took her to the ground and handcuffed her Nov. 12, 2014.

Some seven millennia ago or more, a group of people called the Chinchorro lived along the coasts of northern Chile and southern Peru. Their lives revolved around fishing from the rich Pacific waters, even as a uniquely arid desert — the Atacama — lay inland behind them.

The Chinchorro were unique in many ways, but perhaps most of all in their burial practices. Several thousands of years before the Egyptians, they were mummifying their dead — creating the oldest known mummies on Earth — and doing so in a truly equal fashion. "Whereas the Egyptians considered only kings and other exalted citizens worthy of mummification, the Chinchorro accorded everyone in the community, regardless of age or status, this sacred rite," wrote Bernardo Arriaza, an expert on the mummies, which were first discovered in the Atacama desert in 1917.

Indoors, the change has been slow, but outdoors, mummies are being discovered already damaged, Sepulveda said. "When you excavate mummies you can see that degradation is already there," she said. And the suspected reason? A changing climate.

GREEN BAY, Wis. — In its most recent assessment released this fall, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that the warming of the Earth's climate system is both unequivocal and unprecedented, a conclusion that rests on multiple and independent sources of data.

Nor, for that matter, has China, whose surging economy has pushed it to the No. 1 spot in total greenhouse gas emissions.

SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — On a summer day in 1885, three Hawaiian princes surfed at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on crudely constructed boards made from coastal redwoods, bringing the sport to the North American mainland.

Today their wave-riding successors consult satellite weather forecasts on smartphones before heading to Steamer Lane and Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz to don neoprene wet suits. But the new century could bring the biggest transformation yet to surfing — the waves themselves.

"It definitely worries me," said big-wave rider Jake Wormhoudt, who has already noticed changes in water temperature, weather and sand deposition throughout the 35 years he has surfed in Santa Cruz.

Scientists came to these conclusions using global climate models — complex, computer-based crystal balls that use past conditions, current trends and greenhouse gas emission scenarios to predict our climate future.

While social commentators have long suggested that extreme heat can unleash the beast in man, formal study of the so-called heat hypothesis — the theory that high temperatures fuel aggressive and violent behavior — is relatively new. Using examples as disparate as road rage, ancient wars and Major League Baseball, scientists have taken early steps to quantify the potential influence of [climate warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming) on human conflict.

It's a play to help the former secretary of state connect with younger voters. But so far, the star power isn't swaying the college set. Many say they prefer her rumpled 74-year-old rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, regardless of whether he's got star power behind him or not.

The push for younger voters comes amid an intensifying battle for the Democratic nomination. While Clinton and Sanders are locked in a tight race in Iowa, and Clinton has held the lead nationally, Sanders has a clear advantage among younger voters. A recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa poll forecast that Sanders will have 59 percent of Democratic caucus-goers 45 and under, compared with the 27 percent expected to back Clinton. And in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Sanders led 60 percent to 31 percent among Democratic primary voters under 45.

WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton jumped back into presidential politics on Sunday, announcing her much-awaited second campaign for the White House. "Everyday Americans need a champion. I want to be that champion," she said.

"So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote. Because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey," Clinton said at the end of a video, which features a series of men, women and children describing their aspirations.

"I would expect Hillary Clinton if she believes in women's rights, she should be calling for a boycott of Saudi Arabia," Paul said on NBC's "Meet the Press." ''Instead, she's accepting tens of millions of dollars."

Clinton is the first Democrat to get into the race, but there are some lower-profile Democrats considering challenging her, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.

NEW YORK — Lorella Praeli has one of the most important jobs on Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign — even though she's never voted in an election.

But doing that is a monumental task. Twice as many Latinos will be eligible to vote next year as in 2000, but Latinos tend to turn out at lower rates than other groups, in part because many young Latinos aren't engaged in politics.

A template for that path was created by Austin's father, Doc, who returned to Marquette during summers early in his career with the Atlanta Hawks to finish his degree. Doc Rivers went on to become a broadcaster and now coaches the Clippers.

"I went back my first two years in the NBA," the elder Rivers said. "Everyone told me, including my professors, 'If you didn't go back right away, you're probably not going back,' so I went back."

NEW YORK — Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been banned for life by the NBA in response to racist comments the league says he made in a recorded conversation.

Commissioner Adam Silver said he will try to force the controversial owner to sell his franchise. Sterling has also been fined $2.5 million, and Silver made no effort to hide his outrage over the comments.

Sterling acknowledged he was the man on the tape, Silver said.

In the wake of a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right of a California law school to deny recognition to a Christian student group that excluded gays, InterVarsity and other Christian groups have lost official status at Vanderbilt, Tufts and other universities for refusing to amend their bylaws.

When Audrey Dimitrew won a spot on a club volleyball team in Chantilly, Virginia, the 16-year-old hoped to impress varsity coaches and possibly college coaches.

The lawsuit is one of a number filed across the country in recent years as families have increasingly turned to the courts to intervene in youth sports disputes. Parents upset that their children have been cut, benched, yelled at by coaches or even fouled too hard are asking judges to referee.

Some experts see such lawsuits as part of a shift in youth sports in recent decades away from sandlot play and intramural teams to professionalized leagues and tryout teams partly aimed at snagging scholarships for players and giving them a leg up in college admissions.

Although most kids join just for fun, or to hang out with groups of friends, for some families the competition takes on a more serious focus. Parents are spending thousands of dollars and giving up countless weekends for kids to participate on travel teams and prestigious high school programs. Experts say parents want a return on that investment — and a handful are willing to sue if they don't get it.

Essentially, the Harkin-Engel Protocol failed in its goal of ending the worst forms of child labor by 2005, and its mission now is a 70 percent reduction in child labor abuses by 2020. The mixed results in the past decade call into question whether such goals can be met, Tulane concluded.

Though it resembled a typewriter, with 26 alphabetic keys, it was far more complex, with three or four electrically wired rotors capable of producing endless combinations of coded letters. To make deciphering even more of a challenge, there were a number of different models, each with its own confounding way of changing the input and output, so that, for example, "MMMMM" might come out "QVCTW" one day and a different nonsensical jumble the next. According to Batey, one new decoder fled Bletchley after hearing a detailed description of the Enigma's convoluted innards.

Batey received the barest of introductions.

But some parenting and digital experts question the push to teach young children coding, at schools and particularly over the summer. They argue that such highly technical lessons are unnecessary at early ages, and that the upcoming generation of kids are already digital natives, even without giving up carefree days in the sun.

"For me, the idea of having kids coding at 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old is just absurd," said Jim Taylor, an adjunct professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco and author of "Raising Generation Tech: Preparing Your Children for a Media-Fueled World." "Time spent coding is time not spent playing, which is far more important for creativity, social interaction, and development of motor and social skills."

CHICAGO — Like most high school students, Wells Community Academy junior Darius Taplet doesn't know much about computer programming, a skill that is increasingly seen as a ticket to the good life.

Code.org has established links with 90 of the nation's largest districts, but Partovi said the most ambitious vision has come in Chicago Public Schools. The district has announced a plan to create a K-12 computer science program that ultimately will become a graduation requirement.

CHICAGO — Unlike a lot of people her age, 20-year-old Kelsey Pearsall-Brandon of Lake in the Hills, Ill., has a clear career goal. She wants to be a police officer. But something is standing in her way:

Does she think she'll use algebra as a cop? "Not really," she said. "I gotta catch the criminal. … I'm not going to be finding X."

"We're not saying, 'Let's reduce standards.' We're saying, 'Let's change the way we teach (them),' " said Kathy Almy, a professor at Rockford's Rock Valley College who has written a math literacy textbook.

SEATTLE — Western Washington University's Carver Gym was buzzing with fifth-grade energy one day in October, as nearly 900 students filed into the gym in the heart of the Bellingham campus.

Western isn't the first university to use college mentors to help younger students set their sights on higher education. What sets the program apart is its entry point in fifth grade, a critical moment when students start to size up their own skills when compared with their peers.

The program is essentially a three-credit course for Western students, who spend the first three weeks learning instructional basics and how to work with preteens and teens from different cultural backgrounds, and the remaining seven weeks working in their classrooms as mentors, tutors and role models.

The university won't be able to measure the effectiveness of the program until its original group of fifth-graders, now in ninth grade, graduates from high school in three years. And even then, it may be difficult to tease out the effects of the program from other efforts aimed at boosting college-going rates.

I'm a college student. I'm like you, just a few years older. Study hard, and you can go to college, too.

Among schools in affluent communities: La Canada High School hosted 127 visits from recruiters between August and November. Palisades Charter on the Westside, 133; the private Marlborough School, a girls campus in Hancock Park, 102.

Since the resignation of its president and chancellor Nov. 10, protesters have organized at more than 100 colleges and universities nationwide. Social media sites have lighted up with voices of dissent, and what began as a grievance has evolved into a movement.

Calling for racial and social reforms on their campuses, they are borrowing tactics of the past — hunger strikes, sit-ins and lists of demands — and have found a collective voice to address their frustrations, hurt and rage.

For decades, students have helped drive social change in America, if not the world. Campuses, said University of California President Janet Napolitano, have "historically been places where social issues in the United States are raised and where many voices are heard."

CHICAGO — Tara Montgomery didn't think much of rowing when she first gave it a try. Though she outdid all of her high school classmates on a strength test that gauges aptitude for the sport, she didn't attend practice until her mom, struck by the swelling number of college scholarships offered by women's rowing teams, bribed her with the promise of an iPhone.

Fifty years ago, Colombia shipped its first batch of fresh-cut flowers to Miami ($20,000 worth of carnations by some accounts) and jump-started a billion-dollar industry.

In a handful of decades, flowers in the United States went from being high-end luxury goods sold only at specialized shops to being ubiquitous — from grocery stores to gas stations to traffic lights.

The story of how Colombia became the world's second-largest flower exporter and reshaped U.S. buying habits in the process can be traced back to a handful of adventurous entrepreneurs, a precocious college student and U.S. Cold War policies.

BOGOTA, Colombia — Wedged behind an exhaust-belching bus and ahead of a honking car, Luis Enrique Neira urges his scrawny horse Pagatodo through a busy intersection. Neira has been a horse-cart driver, or a zorrero, since he was 12 years old, eking out a living hauling loads and sometimes recycling scrap metal and cardboard.

Rodriguez said it's anachronistic to find horses and mules pulling wooden carts through this cosmopolitan city. Bogota is almost as large as New York City and is South America's second-largest capital, packed with gleaming high-rises.

Bogota has been the home to working animals since before colonial times. Horses and mules can also be found on the streets of Buenos Aires, Santiago and Montevideo. But in those cities the animals are usually relegated to rural outskirts. In Bogota, horse carts are part of the urban landscape — snarling traffic and keeping pedestrians alert for horse droppings. Successive city governments have been trying to get them off the streets for at least 50 years, Rodriguez said.

Rosa Garzon, 50, brought her horse Mil Amores to the trade-in and received a paper that will entitle her to a vehicle. She said she could earn anywhere from $30 to $100 a day with her horse. But recent bypass surgery and bouts of hypoglycemia make her scared of driving a motorized vehicle.

"I have a car now but they've left me without work," she said, carrying a well-worn bridle. "I don't know how to drive, so I hope one of my children will get a license and we can still make some money."

RIOHACHA, Colombia — It was another day at the office for Elion Uriana, a palabrero, or tribal judge, in Colombia's Wayuu indigenous community. A leader of his goat-herding clan, he was considering the aftermath of an arranged marriage gone bad.

"The parents of the groom had given 60 goats as dowry to the family of the bride. But the girl ran out on him a month after the ceremony and took up with another boy, a very bad deal," said Uriana, 42. "The bride's parents blamed the groom for mistreatment, but in the end there was no reconciliation and so they have to return those goats."

Uriana had helped arrange the marriage, also part of his function as palabrero, which translates as "the word." Uriana said that when it comes to matrimony, freedom of choice is anathema to Wayuu culture: "All our marriages are arranged by the families and the couple has to live by that."

<img class="pull-left" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/9-4-cut-florida-and-hass-avocado.png" />Brooks Tropicals is South Florida's largest grower of avocados and sells the fruit under the brand SlimCado to highlight the fact that it has 50 percent less of the healthy fats found in the fruit. In that sense Florida has its own niche, said Mary Ostlund, the director of marketing.

The Colorado is suffering from a historic drought that has exposed the region's dependence on a single, vulnerable resource. Nearly 40 million people in seven states depend on the river — a population some forecasts say could nearly double in the next 50 years.

JEFFERSON COUNTY, Colo. — Widespread flood recovery efforts continued Sunday in Colorado as hundreds of residents remained unaccounted for and the death toll — as well as the number of missing — continued to rise.

Officials said there were at least 700 Coloradans still listed as missing in Boulder and Larimer counties after the disaster, which has washed out bridges and roads and isolated several central Colorado communities.

Gov. John Hickenlooper, appearing on CNN on Sunday morning, expressed hope that many of the missing are simply out of reach of communications, and have "already gotten out or (are) staying with friends."

WICHITA, Kan. — When Seth Ogden, 8, was at his grandparents' house as a kid, his grandma asked him about the roses in her yard.

Color vision activists refer to Seth's condition as "color vision deficiency" rather than colorblindness because people like Seth can see most basic colors, typically between 10,000 and 100,000 colors in total. Most people can distinguish 1 million colors. The world doesn't appear gray to people like Seth, but when colors are close together he struggles to tell the difference.

Seth won the contest for EnChroma lenses and the company sent him a pair of its color-correcting glasses, which typically retail for hundreds of dollars.

Earlier this month he tried them on for the first time.

"Whoa," he said almost immediately, with his parents looking on. Everything was golden, he said, as the sun shimmered through the branches of trees that had lost their leaves for the winter.

"There are only seven lombards that have been found in the Western world," Clifford told the Miami Herald on Tuesday. "We found the eighth, exactly the distance where Columbus said he lost the Santa Maria."

Columbus had written about the ship's misfortune in his journal, which has become a treasure map for many a explorer. In it, Columbus told how his crew, with help from the native Indian population, had salvaged much of the ship and used the material to build a fort, La Navidad.

Wars of the future will be fought with American women on the front lines and the public has no problem with it.

Most Americans favor the Defense Department's decision to lift a ban on women in combat jobs and do not believe it will hurt military effectiveness, a new poll shows.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced the policy change last week, explaining that the decision was influenced by the role women have already played in risking life and limb in wars of the past decade.

Women comprise 14 percent of the active duty military. According to the Pentagon, 152 female troops have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.

## Ban Hurts Career Advancement

Servicewomen complained that the ban prevents them from advancing their careers. Serving in a combat-facing unit is a stepping-stone to higher rank and leadership commands.

Sixty-six percent of people polled by the Pew Research Center said women should be allowed to serve in fighting units, while just 26 percent said that women should not. Pew surveyed the 1,005 adults between Jan. 24 and 27, a few days after the Pentagon's announcement. Pew said both women and men were equally supportive of the move, but that older Americans were less in favor of women serving in combat than were younger Americans.

"That was the thought in World War II, that you couldn't integrate the military," Duckworth said. "So I think, you know, down the road, we're going to look back in the distance and say, boy, that was a lot of fuss over nothing."
LOS ANGELES  — Comcast Corp. will buy Time Warner Cable Inc. for about $45.2 billion in a deal that combines the nation's top two cable TV companies and would create a dominant force in both creating and delivering entertainment to U.S. homes.

The European Space Agency (ESA) says it has succeeded in landing a spacecraft on a comet for the first time.

Computer science "takes all of the aspects of math that I really love, and puts them all in a nice, pretty package," Dumas Ang said, adding: "The things we can compute is insane."

COMPTON, Calif. — Compton eighth-grader Edgar Ruelas wants to be the first in his family to attend college.

For the past four years, a few dozen agents from William Morris Endeavor (WME) have been mentoring students from two Compton schools.

"They help you with your homework, and once you are done, you can have fun," said Whaley seventh-grader Tytis Barnett, who is mentored by agents George Freeman and Liesl Copland.

This fall, most elementary school students in the Marysville School District are getting 40-minute weekly computer science lessons as part of their core instruction — part of a growing effort nationwide to expose more public school children to computer science, even as early as in kindergarten.

Learning computer science also opens the door to high-demand jobs. By 2020, 4.6 million of 9.2 million science, technology, engineering and math jobs will be in computing, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Jim Taylor, author of "Raising Generation Tech," says there's no evidence at this point that coding or computational learning works or is even needed. Kids don't need to learn how to use digital technology at such a young age either, he added.

One of the challenges is finding enough well-prepared teachers. Among other efforts, an initiative of the National Science Foundation is seeking to have 10,000 well-trained computer science teachers in thousands of high schools.

Currently, computer science is taught in only about 1 of 4 high schools nationwide with fewer in lower middle and elementary school grades. Only 27 states allow a computer science course to be counted toward graduation requirements in math or science, according to Code.org.

But there's been a surge in interest in recent years. In 2015, nearly 49,000 students took the Advanced Placement exam in computer science, a 25 percent increase from the previous year.

The new study, published online last week by the journal Pediatrics, makes clear that while many teens will have few concussion symptoms beyond two to three weeks, the consequences of some brain injuries can extend well beyond the playing field and can persistently degrade an adolescent's academic performance in and outside the classroom.

In that group, those with the highest academic demands — generally students in middle and high school — were most likely to report persistent symptoms of concussion along with difficulties concentrating and keeping up with schoolwork. Math was most frequently cited as the greatest academic challenge.

Even among children considered to be recovering well, academic difficulties were common. In this group, 38 percent reported that headaches, concentration problems and fatigue had interfered with their learning, and 44 percent said their symptoms had taken a toll on academic skills such as note-taking and homework completion.

With the focus on concussions in young athletes intensifying across the nation, the White House on Wednesday unveiled a raft of initiatives aimed at preventing mild traumatic brain injury and improving its diagnosis and treatment in children.

Tisch's donation will sustain and expand a university program that since 2012 has treated 600 young patients with brain injuries and studied the aftereffects of [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) in middle school, high school and college athletes.

FILLMORE, Calif. — A new reality TV show unfolded this year in a cave in a sandstone cliff about 75 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

On a recent weekday, Brandt, Astelle and Devon Pryor, a conservation and research associate at the Santa Barbara Zoo, released three rehabilitated adult condors into the furrowed mountains of Ventura County. Two of the birds had been treated for exposure to lead. The other had surgery on an injured wing.

Like all California condors, the 20-pounders had been fitted with number tags and radio transmitters to allow scientists to track their movements.
WASHINGTON — South Carolina's leading federal lawmakers and the 2016 Republican presidential field are split over what to do about the Confederate battle flag that flies on the State House grounds.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a presidential candidate, said, "It's time for people in South Carolina to revisit" the 2000 compromise that moved the flag from atop the State House to the building's grounds.

There were those who said the flag should come down.

ORANGEBURG, S.C. — Leo Twiggs' paintings of shadowy Confederate flags and faceless men with bulls-eyes on their backs are a few of the haunting images he has developed living as a black man in the South.

"This Confederate flag, the Civil War, they are part of the history of all of us," Twiggs said. "You take the stars off the bars, and it becomes a cross, maybe a railroad crossing. It can become a crossing over, something that we commemorate, and something we can cross over."

Sandy Rupp, owner of the Hampton III Gallery in Taylors, said Twiggs has been exploring flag images since the 1970s.

The great ape is part of park ranger Bauma's second family at the Senkwekwe Center for gorilla orphans in the 3,000-square-mile Virunga National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo, where about a quarter of the world's estimated 880 surviving wild mountain gorillas reside.

Ndakasi was 2 months old when Bauma found her clinging to her mother, who had been shot through the head. Besides the mother, six other Virunga mountain gorillas were shot dead with automatic weapons in mid-2007. The assailants were never found, but they were believed to be connected to the illegal charcoal trade.

Spanning volcanic lava craters, snowcapped mountains, tropical rainforest, misty lakes and sweeping African savanna, Virunga National Park is both the oldest in Africa, designated in 1925, and the largest. It remains home to more species of animals and plants than any other park in Africa.

"It's not just the mountain gorillas. We've also got lowland gorillas and chimpanzees, so it's the only park in the world that has three types of great apes. And given how vulnerable they are and how endangered they are, that makes Virunga extremely important from a conservation perspective," de Merode says.

SEATTLE — Growing up in Chicago, Jesse Okwu's closest connection to nature was watching environmental documentaries on public television. So when he came to Washington for an eight-week summer program on conservation issues, and visited the state's national parks and desert landscapes, it was his first real encounter with the wilderness.

The concern: More than 80 percent of people in conservation jobs — like the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and private groups such as the Nature Conservancy — are white, and come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds.

Students who go into conservation jobs often have a passion for nature and a mind for science, said Sean Watts, director of the summer program called Conservation Scholars. But they may lack people skills or the flexibility to consider an issue from different policy and social perspectives.

Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook's announcement last week that he is gay caps years of efforts by an industry that has long championed gay rights at home. It also might help propel Silicon Valley to the forefront of global struggles for equality, underscoring the reach tech powerhouses have not only with their gadgets and software, but with their positions on heated social issues.

"Here's what I want you to do," the chef behind the acclaimed restaurants Vetri and Osteria began somberly. "Don't cut yourself."

Garces said the impact of such lessons "is pretty instant. It's not just the English: It's the confidence it gives them in the workplace, and they take that out into the community as well."

PUEBLA, Mexico — A plain-spoken Mexican nun has become an unlikely television star while trying to save her congregation from mounting debts.

Sixty-eight-year-old Florinda Ruiz Carapia, better known as Hermana Flor, is one of five finalists on Mexico's version of "Master Chef," a program in which contestants compete for a 1 million peso ($59,000) prize. That would at least make a dent in the approximately 7 million peso debt that her order, the Congregation of the Passion of Jesus Christ, owes for loans it took out to build or expand schools, according to Alejandro Esquivel, producer of the TV Azteca show.

"We have debts, we have missions where we provide aid, and so with this contest, and the million pesos they offer ... I am going to be able to help," she said in a friendly but determined way.

The meek kids from middle school shall inherit the Earth. Or at least they'll live healthier and more productive lives than their "cooler" peers once they enter adulthood.

Researchers studying 13-year-olds found that those who engaged in "pseudomature" behavior — such as minor shoplifting and precocious romantic relationships — and were seen as the "cool kids" tended to develop problems with drugs and relationships by their early 20s.

Misty Copeland made history on Tuesday when she was promoted to principal dancer of the prestigious American Ballet Theatre (ABT), becoming the first African-American ballerina to reach the elite dance company's top rank.

Copeland, 32, has become one of America's most famous female athletes, revered for her unlikely ascendance in an arts world notorious for showcasing only lithe white ballerinas.

And her star power has stretched far beyond dance, yielding larger and larger business opportunities offstage as her pre-eminence onstage has grown. She has authored a best-selling memoir, was featured this year on the cover of Time magazine's "100 Most Influential People," and has starred in a viral Under Armour ad, twirling amid the reading of a rejection letter declaring she has "the wrong body for ballet."

Earlier this spring, Copeland made her U.S. debut in the lead role of Odette/Odile in "Swan Lake" at the Kennedy Center. It was a symbolically significant moment in American arts, in which a black woman danced the role of ballet's famed white swan—and sold out all of her performances from the moment tickets went on sale months earlier.

It's been less than four months since Copeland, now 33, made dance history by becoming the first female African-American principal dancer in American Ballet Theatre's 75-year history. That came just days after her widely covered New York debut in the ultimate ballerina role, Odette/Odile in "Swan Lake." It's a famously demanding role for any ballerina, but for Copeland, it was that much tougher because the world was watching.

George met Copeland at her 2012 debut in "Firebird," a huge leap in her career at the time. Backstage afterward, though, Copeland confessed she was in terrible pain, and she had to pull out of later performances. Once she'd had her surgery, George suggested a film that would chronicle her struggle.

Netflix, meanwhile, is used by an identical percentage of the older set. A large chunk of the younger 6- to 8-year-olds, or 71 percent, are also Netflix users, according to the firm's, "2015 Clicks, Taps & Swipes Report," which was fielded between June and August with a nationally representative panel of kids and their parents.

With an endless selection of videos that are funny, irreverent and even educational, YouTube is not only the new stand-in for traditional cable TV when it comes to kids, but it's also their go-to search engine. And, as kids get older, Netflix satisfies tweens' emerging cravings for more serial material. Both video services win with kids because there is always something to watch, and all that's required is a click of button on their favorite devices.

To court kids and, more importantly their parents, YouTube, Netflix and even Amazon have all created special spaces just for kids. Those family friendly zones do well with preschoolers and kindergartners, but older kids want the real deal.

That, in part, explains the existence of YouTube Red, the digital video service's new $10-per-month subscription option that removes all ads, allows for offline viewing, lets users watch clips while they're using other apps, and will eventually come with original shows and movies featuring YouTube stars. The company has already successfully, perhaps unintentionally, hooked kids while they're young. Why not create a way for these future cord-cutters to pay for more of what they clearly love?

In fact, YouTube ranks as the most-used smartphone app, favorite app and top website for both boys and girls ages 8 through 11, according to KidSay's trend-tracker, which surveys 1,000 children five times per year. When asked to pick how they would watch shows if only allowed a single choice, 30 percent of pre-teen boys opted for YouTube, slightly edging out all other options, including regular TV and other streaming services, according to the survey.

Boys' favorite YouTube channels, which include "JackSepticEye," "PewDiePie" and "Stampylonghead," sound more like ridiculous, cartoon characters than important entertainment brands. Yet, these channels make up an important subculture on YouTube, one that has turned video game commentators and comedians into bona fide celebrities.

YouTube is, of course, still very much a winner with young girls.

Susan Polizzotto's daughters Rachel, 9, and Lauren, 11, watch a variety of YouTube channels using their own iPad mini tablets. The kids watch Stampy's Minecraft videos, check out clips on how to paint nails or style hair, and follow a cooking challenge show.

Their behaviors align with those of other pre-teen girls, a bunch that also named the family video blogs (vlogs) "Shaytards" and "Bratayleys" among their favorite channels in the KidSay survey. The vlogs are reality series-like YouTube shows, but created by real families with their real kids featured prominently. For young girls, the appeal is an intimacy and a connection to the family that feels more real to them than what's on TV, Burke said.

In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned to Europe with a handful of revelations and a pocket full of corn seeds. He had learned about many things during his travels to the New World, but few were as exciting as the promising grain he had encountered for the first time. It was unfamiliar; it was delicious; it was, as Columbus romanticized at the time, "affixed by nature in a wondrous manner and in form and size like garden peas," and it could, if they learned to farm it properly, help feed a lot of people.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Dave Vierra started small. As a sideshow to his popular West Sacramento, California, pumpkin patch, he planted his first corn maze 12 years ago. It covered a mere half an acre.

But just like field corn, it quickly grew – and grew. Now, Dave's Pumpkin Patch and Cornival boasts two corn mazes. The larger maze uses 10 acres as a canvas and has corporate partners' logos carved into the corn. The other 2 acres of maze are "haunted" for weekend tours, staffed by more than 40 volunteer zombies and other characters.

In addition to the mazes, the Vierra Farm has a 40-by-60-foot air-filled pillow for jumping, corn containers for playing and hay bales for climbing. His Cornival also features a "Pumpkin Princess Castle," pig races, pony rides, hay rides and pumpkin chuckin' cannons.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Through 13 years of teaching, Jennifer Kavanaugh never dreamed of hitting a child — not even once.

"All studies point to the fact that corporal punishment does not make for a more peaceful, happier child," she said at the Capitol on Wednesday.

The trend away from corporal punishment mirrors a national trend. For the 2009-2010 school year, about 184,500 students were physically punished, compared with about 223,000 in the 2005-2006 school year, according to the department.

"We need to require more of teachers," she said.

Senate Minority Leader and committee Chairwoman Jolie Justus said she wanted to move the bill forward but believed there could be a hang-up on the private school portion.

"I suspect we'll hear from people who don't want state intervention in private schools," Justus said. "At some point, we may need some compromise when some folks come and talk to us. Right now, I haven't heard any opposition."
DENVER — Around 1,000 young people across several high schools in suburban Denver participated Wednesday in the largest of a series of student demonstrations opposing a new set of high school history standards proposed by a conservative-led school board.

Most of the young protesters gathered at a busy intersection, chanting "Education without limitation!" and waving signs and American flags.

Students began walking out of classes in waves on Monday, organizing largely by social media. Hundreds of students from at least six area schools have participated.

The dozens of students who left Alameda International High School in Lakewood asked McMinimee about the school board plan and teacher concerns including pay, KMGH-TV reported. He said he was worried that students have not fully informed themselves.

"I think sometimes, as a student," he told the station, "sometimes you hear what is going on, you don't necessarily have the whole picture."
NEW YORK — As the Bronx middle schoolers harmonized in their auditorium and plucked out basic chords on ukuleles and guitars, in walked their music instructor, Liz Rose — a Grammy Award-winning country songwriter from Nashville.

"Y'all are awesome," Rose said as she approached the stage. "Y'all made me cry."

Rose, who won a Grammy with Swift for best country song in 2010 for "White Horse," first met her students over Skype. Rose helped them write the lyrics for the song, which they performed this past week at All for the Hall, a benefit concert for education programs at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum at the Best Buy Theater in Times Square. Students shared the stage with Brad Paisley, Paul Simon and Carrie Underwood.

Kyle Young, chief executive officer of the Country Music Hall of Fame, says he was moved when he saw the students from the Bronx onstage at All for the Hall, dressed in their blue school uniforms under T-shirts for Words &amp; Music and Education Through Music.

NASHVILLE — Leslie Fram started seeing the problems that women were facing in country music when she came to Nashville four years ago to lead CMT's music strategy division.

"There are people all over the country that are seeing these examples as beacons of hope to take big money out of politics and engage regular people in elections," Donnelly said. "It's an incredible, democratizing policy."

Seattle's measure has its detractors.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that naturally occurring human genes may not be patented, potentially opening up commercial and scientific terrain to more freewheeling exploration.

Intellectual property attorney Vernon Winters, who is with the San Francisco Bay Area offices of the Sidley Austin law firm, stressed that the court's decision is limited in that it doesn't disturb "method claims for manipulating genes or DNA" or "claims for new and specific applications for DNA sequences, as opposed to the isolated sequences themselves."

Barbara Rudolph, an intellectual property attorney in the Washington office of the Finnegan law firm, said in an interview that it was "hard to predict" how the decision would play out for companies and inventors, though she suggested that it was "a winner" for biotech firms that specialized in lab-synthesized cDNA, which remained patent eligible. Rudolph added that the court sought to balance whether patents serve as an incentive or an impediment to invention.

Underscoring the scientific complications of the case, Justice Antonin Scalia issued a one-paragraph concurring opinion in which he noted the "fine details of molecular biology" in the court's decision.

"I am unable to affirm those details on my own knowledge or even my own belief," Scalia said.
San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf typically bustles this time of year as workers prepare to haul in millions of pounds of Dungeness crab that are a tradition at Thanksgiving and other holiday meals.

A massive bloom of microscopic algae — which produced a natural toxin called domoic acid that is harmful to wildlife and fish — in the Pacific Ocean is threatening the crab industry during a time when many fishing outfits make their most money. It's also roiling coastal tourism and marine ecosystems.

Although the fragments have not yet been dated, the scientists said they could well represent one of the most primitive members of the genus Homo, which includes today's humans.

KAVOUSI, Greece — High on a hill overlooking the Mirabello Bay and what the poet Homer called the "wine dark sea," work resumed in June uncovering an ancient city that had been lost for millennia on the island of Crete.

Archaeologists and students from North Carolina and across the U.S., as well as local Cretan workers, were using shovels, picks, trowels and sieves in a quest to understand the mysteries of Azoria, a city destroyed by fire about 2,500 years ago.

The project is the life's work of Donald Haggis, an archaeology professor at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who is the project director. UNC is one of only three American universities with a license to dig in Greece, underscoring its long-held national reputation for top-drawer archaeological scholarship.

It's summer, which is the digging season at Azoria. UNC, which holds the permit from the Greek government, can only dig six weeks per year. Haggis and his crew have been digging off and on since 2002, so considerable work has been done.

No, [Pope Francis](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) isn't taking up the sport long associated with manicured grounds and English nobility; the soccer-mad "slum pope" still prefers the lower-brow sport of his beloved San Lorenzo club.

Australia's ambassador to the Holy See, John McCarthy, was the brainchild behind the initiative and said he hopes the St. Peter's Cricket Club will field a team to play the Church of England at Lord's sometime next fall.

He said the aim is to boost interfaith dialogue, given cricket's immense popularity in largely non-Catholic India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. It would be a "very special occasion" if seminarians from Rome's pontifical universities might one day play students at Muslim or Hindu religious schools on the subcontinent, he said.

LYNCHBURG, Va. — Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, announced — again — his candidacy for president in a speech Monday morning at a landmark of the American evangelical movement, Liberty University.

"Today, I am announcing that I am running for president of the United States," Cruz said, about 20 minutes into a speech to students here. "Ted! Ted!" students yelled.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — It's the start of a new school year, and C.J. Pearson is a busy guy.



At Pearson's fingertips is an immense social media following he attracted in February. When former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned how much President Barack Obama loves America, Pearson defended Giuliani with a YouTube video.

Conservative news websites jumped on it and applauded the teenager who stood up to the president. What followed was 2 million YouTube views, 36,000 Twitter followers, Fox News interviews and plenty of angry feedback.

Pearson, an only child, lives in Grovetown, Ga., with his grandparents, Willie, 51, a contractor for the state energy department, and Robin, 54, who stays at home.

Pearson said politics first piqued his interest in 2008, when his first-grade class held a mock presidential election. He was awed by Senator John McCain's military service and started following political news.

He decided in early 2014 that he wanted to be a political strategist, but he didn't become a Republican until he started learning about the party's principles.

"Government that governs least governs best," Pearson said. "Conservatism resonates with me because I've seen firsthand the damaging effects big government can have on our America and to be quite frank, I don't like it one bit," citing his experience with Common Core education standards.

Pearson said he plans to join the local school board as soon as he graduates from high school, and then work behind the scenes in politics after college before he runs for office. Though his relatives are Democrats and want Vice President Joe Biden to run in 2016, Pearson said they support his work with Cruz, even if they won't vote for him.

Before his ascent to stardom, Pearson volunteered for local Republicans Senator David Perdue, Representative Rick Allen and Governor Nathan Deal in 2014. He then founded Young Georgians in Government and persuaded state legislators to introduce a bill to lower election ages for the state house.

Now, Pearson is tapping into his fan base for Cruz, seeking out other politically minded youngsters to build a national network. They'll use Twitter and Instagram to sell their contemporaries on the senator.

And those teens can then lean on the eligible voters they interact with every day.

Pearson said Cruz has a natural appeal to teens: He drives elders crazy.

"He's a bold person. He's really someone who's led on issues and stood up to everyone," said Pearson, comparing Cruz to current Republican front-runner Donald Trump. "That's something a lot of young teenagers are looking for."

Cruz said as much recently when he announced Pearson's role as chairman of Teens for Ted.

"Young people are looking for someone who does more than just talk a good game. They want someone who has walked the walk," said Cruz, recounting his 2013 fight against increasing the federal government's borrowing limit, which he ultimately lost. "They're looking for a fighter. But most importantly, they're looking for someone who cares."

Pearson said he also appreciates Cruz's willingness to get a little silly, like when he twirled for freedom for BuzzFeed and cooked bacon on the barrel of a machine gun for a site called IJ Review.

"I think there's going to be an explosion in all of those kinds of collaborations," said Mauro Guillen, director of the Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

At Auburn University in Alabama, the college of agriculture agreed to partner with the Agrarian University of Havana under a new five-year exchange agreement. The University of the District of Columbia and the University of California at Fullerton also signed deals with Cuban schools.

Under previous travel rules, some colleges had gained permission to launch academic trips to Cuba, but college officials said the process was riddled with bureaucratic barriers. Even those who went through the lengthy application process often were denied.

"A lot of my students, they want to go to Cuba not just because they can learn about this fascinating place, but they also see themselves potentially in the very near future doing business over there," said Guillen, who has led student trips to Cuba.

For many U.S. colleges, Cuba also represents a largely untapped pool of future students.

But after analyzing all the exceptions and drilling into the complicated U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule, Miami Customs attorney Lenny Feldman has come up with what he calls his "yes" list — imports from self-employed workers that are permitted even though the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in place.

On the State Department's negative list of products that cannot be imported are sugar, tobacco and vegetables, prepared foods and beverages, spirits — sorry, no rum — machinery, electrical equipment, minerals, most chemical products, aircraft, vessels, arms and ammunition, and vehicles — precluding the importation of vintage cars.

HERSHEY, Cuba — Along the coastal highway 30 miles east of Havana, the road signs point to a turnoff for Camilo Cienfuegos City. It doesn't exist. At least not by that name.

"AIR-shee" is what everyone still calls it. Hershey. That much remains.

Most of the rest of the model town founded by U.S. chocolate tycoon Milton Hershey in 1916 is in a state of heartbreaking ruin. The looming sugar mill, once among the world's most advanced, is a gutted, ghostly hulk. Its rusting machinery spills from the wreckage as if blasted by a bomb or kicked apart by a giant.

Gone, too, is the Hershey Social Club, the golf course and other traces of the American experiment that flourished here until it was obliterated by a revolution that did not share the northern ideals of private industry and social progress held dear by "Mister Hershey."

With U.S. businesses pushing harder than ever now against the Cuba trade embargo and angling for a return after a 50-year lockout, a new optimism has reached forlorn rural towns like Hershey, even if no one really expects the Americans to get the mill running again or the smell of molasses to return any time soon.

That was how Milton Hershey made his fortune. He had put his name on a model town in Pennsylvania built around his vision of scientific planning and corporate benevolence. With sugar prices peaking during World War I, he chose to build another all-American town, this time amid the oceanic sugar cane fields on the bluffs overlooking Cuba's north coast.

The two countries would open embassies in the same buildings that once served as their diplomatic headquarters in Havana and Washington. Since 1977, they have housed Interests Sections under the supervision of third-party governments, allowing Cuba and the United States to conduct diplomatic business with each other in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.

A country on the state-sponsor-of-terrorism list is banned from U.S. arms exports and sales and U.S. economic assistance and is under a wide variety of other financial restrictions. All of those prohibitions will remain, in Cuba's case, under other congressionally mandated sanctions.

Sen. Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois who participated in efforts to reach an accord with Cuba, said that "while no fan of the Castro regime, I continue to believe that opening up the island to American ideas, vibrancy and trade is the most effective way to see a more open and tolerant Cuba."

"Opening the door with Cuba for trade, travel, and the exchange of ideas will create a force for positive change in Cuba that more than 50 years of our current policy of exclusion could not achieve," said Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/APTOPIX_Cuba_Violins__Edit.jpg" />HAVANA — In a light-filled workshop cluttered with tools and pieces of old string instruments, three men carve strips of imported wood and silently measure the angles of violin pegs and viola necks bent out of tune by years of use.

Here in the heart of old Havana, Andres Martinez and his two apprentices wage a daily battle against one of Cuba's lesser-known economic problems: A country famous for its music is running low on musical instruments.

Cuba's dozens of free music schools turn out thousands of skilled young musicians each year, many of whom play imported instruments that can only be repaired and maintained with hard-to-find materials from abroad. Delicate and complex, string instruments are among the hardest to keep in tune.

Before Cuba's 1959 revolution, many students played violins, violas, cellos and bass violins from European workshops. After it, the Soviet Union provided violins and cellos, along with many other goods. Now, as Cuba struggles to revive its stagnant centrally planned economy, students must make do with violins from China that too easily pop strings and lose their tone.

"This is a government that has shown it acts because of convenience and does not respect private capital," she said. Sanchez added, however, that people abroad should support the nascent sector of private micro businesses known as "self employment."

MIAMI — In a country where Fidel Castro once proposed breeding mini-cows for pasturing in backyards, it should be no surprise that Cubans have become masters of improvisations and inventions in the face of their myriad scarcities.

They punch holes in the bottom of a water bottle and presto, it's a shower head. If they can't find AA batteries for the TV remote control, they use a rubber band to attach a C battery, solder in some wires and surf away.

MacGyver himself would have approved of roasting hot dogs and hamburgers on the seat of a metal chair, dropping a raw egg into a car radiator to plug a leak and using a bar of soap to stop a drip from a vehicle's oil pan.

CHICAGO — Doctors 2 parents: Limit kids' tweeting, texting &amp; keep smartphones, laptops out of bedrooms. #goodluckwiththat.

It's been linked with violence, cyberbullying, school woes, obesity, lack of sleep and a host of other problems. It's not a major cause of these troubles, but "many parents are clueless" about the profound impact media exposure can have on their children, said Dr. Victor Strasburger, lead author of the new American Academy of Pediatrics policy.

The policy is aimed at all kids, including those who use smartphones, computers and other Internet-connected devices. It expands the academy's longstanding recommendations on banning televisions from children's and teens' bedrooms and limiting entertainment screen time to no more than two hours daily.

Public health advocates hope that reducing the number of stores where tobacco products can be sold and advertised will help push smoking rates down even further.

WASHINGTON — Sarah Ball was a 15-year-old high school sophomore at Hernando High School in Brooksville, Florida, when a friend posted on Facebook: "I hate Sarah Ball, and I don't care who knows."

With sales of milk as a beverage at the lowest level in more than 30 years, the dairy industry is fighting back with a $500 million campaign that includes products such as milk cartons that don't require refrigeration until they're opened.

MILWAUKEE — Incidents of sick and injured dairy cows being slapped, poked and forced to their feet with heavy machinery — while not common — may not be that unusual, according to farmers and others who viewed an undercover video this week from the Wiese Brothers Farm in Brown County, Wis.

The video, shot this fall by an investigator of the animal rights group Mercy for Animals, depicts workers at Wiese Brothers Farm dragging downed cows by their legs and necks using chains attached to tractors, and whipping downed cows in the face and body while shouting profanities at them.

It also shows a disabled cow suspended in the air with a mechanical lift, an image that animal care experts say seems shockingly cruel, and it shows sick or injured cows suffering from open wounds.

Wiese Brothers Farm did not return two Milwaukee Journal Sentinel calls asking for comment, but in a statement the farm's owners said they had fired two employees for suspected animal abuse, and the farm was cooperating with a Brown County Sheriff's Department investigation into animal cruelty allegations.

Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, issued a statement that called on Lasee to "investigate and prosecute" the workers who were shown harming the cattle.

At dawn, he coaxed milk from the cows in his father Roger's barn below a pink and turquoise sunrise and lush green hillsides near Ridgeland, Wis. Then he went back to work, restoring the century-old farmhouse that will soon become his young family's home.

Now it's 11 p.m., and his wife, Tiffany, is reaching up to wrap her arms around his neck, kissing him goodbye after a 90-mile drive from the farm to the Amtrak depot in St. Paul.

A duffel bag slung over his shoulder, Klefstad searches for a seat. More than 54,000 passengers last year rode this 12-hour, overnight train to the Bakken oil fields near Williston — more than doubling the passenger volume since North Dakota's latest oil boom began.

He's part of a huge army of migrants, mostly young men, now pouring into these sparse plains where the science of hydraulic fracturing has jump-started the global energy game. Fracking is unleashing billions of barrels of oil no longer trapped 2 miles deep in North Dakota's shale.

Like gold prospectors bound for California in 1849 and their Dust Bowl descendants who followed during the Depression, or waves of rural, Southern blacks flocking northward to industrial Chicago and Detroit after World War II, today's modern migration is epic.

Visitors to a new exhibition at The Dali Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, won't just be looking at art. Thanks to virtual reality, they'll be exploring a Dali painting in a dreamy, three-dimensional world that turns art appreciation into an unforgettable, immersive experience.

The new exhibition, "Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination," tells the story of the relationship between Salvador Dali, the surrealist artist, and Walt Disney, the great American animator and theme-park pioneer.

Called "Dreams of Dali," the VR experience takes viewers inside Dali's 1935 painting "Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's 'Angelus.'" The painting depicts two towering stone figures along with tiny human figures in a bare landscape with a moody sky. Users can move around inside the painting, using Oculus Rift headsets to navigate a trippy three-dimensional environment that includes motifs from other Dali works like elephants, birds, ants and his "Lobster Telephone" sculpture.

"You actually have a three-dimensional feeling that you're inside a painting," said Jeff Goodby, whose firm Goodby Silverstein & Partners created the VR experience. "It's not just like you're inside a sphere with things being projected. It's actually like there are objects closer and further away and you're walking amidst them. It's a vulnerable feeling you give yourself up to. It's not like anything you've ever felt before." The VR experience was previewed in New York for the media 10 days before its opening Saturday at the Florida museum.

Disney and Dali also collaborated on a short animated movie, "Destino," that was eventually completed by Disney Studios. The six-minute movie, which can be found on YouTube, features a dancing girl with long dark hair, a sundial motif and a song with the line, "You came along out of a dream. ... You are my destino." Clips will be played within the gallery for the Disney-Dali exhibition, and the full short will be shown at the museum's theater.

And despite the 1970s clothing and Studio 54-era glitter of the art and photographs, the exhibit feels fresh. Warhol's vision of pop culture and fame fits right in with America's 21st century love of the Kardashians and TMZ.com.

Even worse, only 6 percent of adolescents got the recommended 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise during their dance classes, the study says.

It turned out that none of the seven dance genres tested could be counted on to provide 30 minutes of meaningful exercise, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advise kids to get, according to a report published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. (The CDC also recommends that kids get 30 minutes of exercise at school.)

Other studies using similar methods to measure physical activity have found that 50 percent to 100 percent of kids in sports programs are able to meet the CDC goal of getting 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise, compared with fewer than 10 percent of kids in this study. That's a shame, they wrote, because dance classes might appeal to girls who aren't interested in sports.

The end may be near for the half-century-old Dictionary of American Regional English. In a few months, the budget pool will drain to a puddle. Layoff notices have been sent and eulogies composed.

With more than 4,800 feet of earth helping screen out background radiation, scientists tried to trap dark matter, which they hoped would be revealed in the form of weakly interacting massive particles, nicknamed WIMPS. The search, using the most sensitive equipment in the world, is looking for the light fingerprint of a WIMP bouncing off an atomic nucleus of xenon cooled to minus 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

"It's ghost-like matter," McKinsey said.

NEW YORK — Soon after customers arrive at Mozzeria for the first time, they notice something's different about the restaurant: Virtually every staffer is deaf.

Owners Russ and Melody Stein are also deaf, and have run their San Francisco restaurant since 2011. The business is thriving because customers love the food and the Steins have overcome obstacles deaf people can face when they become small business owners — particularly lingering stereotypes and prejudice, and fewer resources than hearing entrepreneurs have.

"We have the same skills as a hearing individual," Russ Stein says.

Running Mozzeria comes naturally to Melody Stein, whose family is in the restaurant business.

"It's something I've always wanted to do," she says.

Deaf people have the same ambition and ability to be entrepreneurs and business owners as those who hear, says Tom Baldridge, director of the business administration program at Gallaudet University, the largest educational institution serving the deaf and hard of hearing. There's a growing interest among Gallaudet students in entrepreneurship, matching the increase in business schools across the country. The university is expanding its entrepreneurship offerings beyond courses, and giving students experience in running businesses like campus coffee shops.

Vendors and other business owners who can hear are often startled or feel awkward when they first meet the couple. Some have assumed that because the Steins are deaf, they didn't know what they were doing, Russ Stein says. Some have been impatient about using pen and paper to communicate, or have said offensive or inappropriate things.

"People ask, 'how do you drive?'" Stein says.

DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — The cracking sounds were ferocious. An ankle-deep, frozen lake in Death Valley National Park was breaking apart under sunny skies.

Their photos last Dec. 21 provided the final evidence in solving a mystery of the Racetrack Playa that has long puzzled visitors and scientists: What mechanism moves rocks across flat dirt in the heart of the hottest, driest place on Earth?

The first requirement is rain in a parched climate. Next, temperatures must fall low enough to freeze the water before it evaporates. Then the sun has to come out and thaw the ice. Finally, wind has to blow strongly enough to break the ice into floes and move it across shallow water underneath. Even a light wind will do.

On Dec. 20, the two cousins returned to inspect the instruments. "We found the playa covered with ice," Richard Norris recalled. "We also noticed fresh rock trails near shards of thin ice stacked up along the shoreline."

The following afternoon, "we were sitting on a mountainside and admiring the view when a light wind kicked up and the ice started cracking," Richard Norris said. "Suddenly, the whole process unfolded before our eyes."

"It makes sense. We have kids that are less active than before," said Dr. Stephen Daniels, a University of Colorado pediatrician and spokesman for the heart association.

Experts and educators blame an obsession with academic testing scores for China's competitive college admissions as well as a proliferation of indoor entertainment options such gaming and web surfing for the decline.

World Health Organization numbers suggest that 80 percent of young people globally may not be getting enough exercise.
RICHMOND, Va. — Asein Ta wasn't yet a teenager when he left his native Myanmar (also known as Burma) and followed his uncle, who hobbled on one leg, on a treacherous three-day journey across mountains and into one of Thailand's largest refugee camps.

"He said there was good out there, something different," said Ta, now 21. Ta's mother sent him away so he could escape the persecution his family and other ethnic Karens faced in their native land. She died shortly after he left.

Five years later, Ta was on a plane to Richmond, Virginia, helped by a little-known resettlement effort called the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program, which is operated by the U.S. government with help from states and local charities. In nearly 35 years, the program has helped some 13,000 children from Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America to escape from war, persecution and natural disasters.

"The evidence fully supports my findings that (1) Mr. Brady participated in a scheme to tamper with the game balls after they had been approved by the game officials for use in the AFC Championship Game and (2) Mr. Brady willfully obstructed the investigation by, among other things, affirmatively arranging for destruction of his cellphone knowing that it contained potentially relevant information that had been requested by the investigators," Goodell wrote in his ruling. "All of this indisputably constitutes conduct detrimental to the integrity of, and public confidence in, the game of professional football."

TIJUANA, Mexico — The nighttime ritual has always been the same for Emma Sanchez Paulsen and her three sons: They pile onto her bed as she begins to weave a tale.

The bedtime stories in their home in Vista, California, used to be about her childhood in Mexico — running through green pastures or strolling through city plazas. Then, nine years ago, when Alex was 5, Ryan was 3 and Brannon was just 2 months old, she was banished from the United States. The only time they could cuddle on her bed was when they visited her in Tijuana.

They devised a series of childish schemes to get their mother back to the United States. One involved a trampoline to bounce over the border wall. Or maybe they could attach a bunch of balloons to her limbs. Or put her in a box.

MEXICO CITY — In a corner of her room is a pink drawer. It's almost hidden by the 3-foot pile of clothes. But when Alejandra Pinzon clears a path and pulls open the plastic drawer, she can touch her most cherished possessions: a jumble of mementos that connect her to a life that's slipping from her grasp.

Pinzon was 17 and living in the United States illegally. She wanted to go to college, but she knew that wasn't an option. She worried about being deported. She thought she could go back to Mexico, get her degree, build her skills and then, hopefully, a U.S. company would sponsor her to return on a visa. She might be back in as little as four or five years.

It didn't work out that way.

BERKELEY, Calif. — To save their classmate who was deported to Mexico, the fourth-graders devised an epic plan. That Rodrigo Guzman, 10, could no longer be with his friends and attend Jefferson Elementary seemed so obviously unfair to these students. So they started an online petition that got 2,788 signatures. They created a Facebook page and posted videos to YouTube.

At halftime of a recent "bout," spectators milled around the Doll House with food and drinks in hand, browsing merchandise stalls and stopping to listen to cover bands.

They are building the Carlsbad Desalination Project, which will convert as much as 56 million gallons of seawater each day into drinking water for San Diego County residents. The project, with a price tag of $1 billion, is emerging from the sand like an industrial miracle. In California's highly regulated coastal zone, it took nearly 15 years to move from concept to construction, surviving 14 legal challenges along the way.

More than 85 of Detroit's approximately 100 public schools were closed Wednesday as teachers staged a sickout to protest the system's overcrowded classrooms, broken finances and crumbling facilities.

February's diamond heist stunned the world by seeming more like a Hollywood film trailer than something from real life.

Just as the crew completed loading the last of the packages into plane, two black vehicles—one a Mercedes-Benz van and one an Audi car—came careening through a hole in an outside gate and onto the tarmac with blue lights flashing. Once the cars came to a screeching halt next to the plane, eight heavily armed men wearing police uniforms and face masks got out of the cars, pointed guns at the crew and ordered them to open the cargo compartment.

The entire heist took two minutes, 50 seconds to complete. By the time backup security was called, the robbers had vanished. Fortunately, no one was injured in the heist. Passengers on the plane had no idea what had happened just inches below their feet. They only found out about the heist when their flight was cancelled and they were forced to walk back into the Brussels airport.

The Mercedes-Benz van was found soon after the heist, burned and without anyone in it. The Audi car was not found and a manhunt soon began.

It took European authorities nearly three months to find the suspects involved with the Brussels diamond heist. When captured, police also found many uncut diamonds and more than $100,000 cash.

## Diamond Heist History

The heist in Brussels may have shocked the world, but it is not the first such seizure on record. In fact, there have been several attempts and successful confiscations of diamonds in the past.

"There's no way around buying them," said Capper, a 41-year-old single mother who doesn't work because of a disability.

Across the country, mothers like Capper are facing the same predicament. According to a report published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, diaper need — the inability to afford to keep a child in clean diapers — affects a "substantial" number of low-income Americans, with nearly 30 percent of mothers questioned in New Haven, Conn., reporting that they did not have enough for their children. It's a problem that often goes unnoticed.

In Los Angeles, nonprofits and social service agencies report that the need for diapers is "practically infinite" and that diapers "fly" out of warehouses as soon as they're delivered. When word spread — mistakenly — that Los Angeles-based Baby2Baby was handing out diapers directly to parents, desperate parents came to its office and formed a line that snaked around the corner in just a couple of hours, said co-chair Norah Weinstein. The nonprofit also received 3,000 voicemail messages that day.

Keeping a young child dry and clean can cost a pretty penny; the average is $18 a week. A single mother earning $15,080 a year in a [minimum-wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) job would need to devote more than 6 percent of her pay to diapers, according to the Pediatrics study.

Add in the fact that many lower-income families can't afford to buy diapers in bulk at stores like Costco and Target and the expense becomes prohibitive. Cloth diapers are often not an option because they require frequent and expensive trips to the laundromat.

The report in Pediatrics is the first academic study to quantify diaper need, said co-authors Megan Smith of the Yale School of Medicine and Joanne Goldblum of the National Diaper Bank Network both in New Haven.

Fanning out across New Haven to schools, stores, bus stops, beauty parlors and other locations where mothers might congregate, the research team asked women about their health, medical care, use of social services and access to basic needs such as food, housing and diapers.

They found that 27.5 percent of the women in the study reported diaper need. They didn't have enough to change their children as often as they'd like, and they had turned to social service agencies, friends or family for help or had "stretched" the diapers they had. Latinas had a higher level of need than African-American and white women. Women 45 or older (who the team assumed were mostly caring for grandchildren) also had greater need.

"Losing out on day care makes it even harder for parents to put in a full day's work," she wrote. "And so they fall further behind."

DeLauro's effort failed, in part because of opposition from critics such as Rush Limbaugh, who told his radio audience that "this gives a new meaning to the term 'pampering the poor.'"

For now, much of the need will be met by nonprofits like the National Diaper Bank Network, which counts Baby2Baby and L.A. Diaper Drive among its members. (Early Head Start centers provide diapers to participating families on the grounds that they're "necessary materials for sanitary and hygienic toileting practices," according to the federal program's website.)

Capper gets her diapers through Children's Institute Inc., a Los Angeles-based children's welfare organization that receives diapers from Baby2Baby and L.A. Diaper Drive.

Because Ezekiel is enrolled in the institute's Early Head Start program, she gets free diapers. But many of the 25,000 children and families served by the organization receive diapers as a reward for attending parenting classes, said Megan Aubrey, the institute's director of development.

Diapers have been the one incentive that keeps parents showing up for class, said Aubrey, who added that providing access to diapers "instills confidence" in struggling parents.

WASHINGTON — Citing research suggesting that diet soft drinks and other artificially sweetened products actually contribute to weight gain, a new advocacy group is asking federal regulators to investigate whether manufacturers including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have engaged in false or misleading advertising.

"Consumers are using products — Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi — that are advertised to make us think they assist in weight loss, when in fact ample scientific evidence suggests that this is not true, and the opposite may well be true," says the petition to the Food and Drug Administration.

The American Beverage Association, speaking for the Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo Inc. and other soft-drink makers, strongly disputed the assertions in the petition. It said numerous studies showed "that diet beverages are an effective tool as part of an overall weight management plan."

WASHINGTON — Some Americans might not have to cut back on eggs and salt as much as they once thought, and eating lean meat is still OK. But watch the added sugars, especially the sugary drinks.

Congress got involved, encouraging the administration to drop the recommendations based on environmental impact and at one point proposing to set new standards for the science the guidelines can use. That language did not become law, however. A year-end spending bill simply said the guidelines must be "based on significant scientific agreement" and "limited in scope to nutritional and dietary information."
PHILADELPHIA – Typhoon Haiyan, one of the largest storms ever recorded, hit the Philippines Nov. 7, killing thousands and displacing more than 600,000. The full toll is not yet known, communications and access routes are far from restored, and aid has been slow to reach stranded, isolated victims.

If you've visited Facebook this week, you've seen a page-top banner that reads "Emergency Relief Donation" and "This donation to the American Red Cross will help those affected by the typhoon in the Philippines." Click. Facebook and the Red Cross continued the partnership through Friday.

The University of Minnesota, which just purchased its first Disklavier, sees it as a valuable teaching tool whose potential has barely been scratched, said Alexander Braginsky, a professor of piano at the UM School of Music.

Initially, it will be used to receive audition recordings for the 2015 International e-Piano Junior Competition to be held at UM, and for teaching.

But that's just the beginning, he said. "I have used one of these Disklaviers to do remote piano lessons between Minneapolis and New York, and between New York and Tokyo," he said. "The students enjoy it very much. I think the uses for music education are yet to be fully explored."

"After Snowden, how comfortable can anyone be putting their personal or professional life online, or even on their own computer?" said Warren Sack, a software designer and media theorist who's a professor in the film and digital media department at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

In a poll last month marking the 25th anniversary of the World Wide Web, the Pew Research Center found that 81 percent of U.S. adults use laptop and desktop computers at home, work, school or someplace else. The poll of 1,006 Americans, taken in January, also found that 90 percent of all U.S. adults have cellphones, of which 58 percent are smartphones. In the 18-29 age group, 98 percent have cellphones, 83 percent of which are smartphones.

The Pew Research Center's Internet project found that 87 percent of U.S. adults use the Internet at least occasionally and 71 percent use it every day.

"This is a significant increase from the year 2000, our first measure, when just 29 percent of all adults said they went online on a typical day," according to Pew.

They would lug the typewriters to a weekly "vintage night" at a local bar, where some people would type, others would knit and a disc jockey would — naturally — play vinyl records.

"I keep them because they are very beautiful," she said of her collection of vintage phones. Several work.

She has a smartphone to keep in touch with students but often forgets she has it, "for the pleasure of being able to be left alone." And that ability to control whom you are in contact with matters more and more.

HORSE MOUNTAIN, Utah — Scott Richardson is up at dawn, standing atop a rocky ridgeline near his base camp, a solitary figure in the slanting light. He surveys a primordial wilderness of dry creek beds and stands of juniper and pinyon pine.

"This is dinosaur country," he says, gesturing toward the valley below. "There are bones all over this place."

In the prevailing scientific view, they are microscopic remains of ancient pigment granules, offering clues to the colors of winged dinosaurs.

But a new study by a Drexel University graduate proposes a different explanation — one that has ruffled a few academic feathers.

Siats, though, isn't related to the tyrannosauroid family but rather to the allosauroids. Its best-known relative might be the Giganotosaurus, found in South America.

The 3-inch chunk turned out to be part of a Nodosaurus, a 94-million-year-old dinosaur that looked like a "fat, squatty cow with armor," said Michael Polcyn, an SMU paleontologist.

They thought the bone was probably from a plesiosaur, which "we have all over the Metroplex," SMU paleontologist Dale Winkler said.

The paleontologists wrapped the bones, which were protected by the rock areas, in plaster and moved the 6-foot-by-3-foot, 18-inch-thick Australia-shaped lump to Jacobs' lab at SMU, where they will take the skeleton apart, clean the bones and reconstruct what they can of the dinosaur.

The scientists say they probably won't know why the Nodosaurus died, but they already know how, just from where it was found.

Dinosaurs almost bankrupted the tooth fairy. New research shows that the lumbering plant-eaters called sauropods produced new teeth as often as twice per month and had up to nine backup teeth in a single tooth socket.

While the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex is known as the king of the dinosaurs, the sauropods were the real royalty. These creatures, including the childhood favorite Apatosaurus (previously known as Brontosaurus), were the largest animals that ever lived on land.

"A big T. rex is maybe 40 or 45 feet tall, but a big sauropod pushes 100 feet long or more," said Michael D'Emic, a vertebrate paleontologist at Stony Brook University in New York and lead author of the teeth study published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One.

Having never let go of a childhood fascination with dinosaurs, D'Emic wondered how the enormous size — and hence diet — of sauropods may have affected the evolution of their jaws and teeth. Since they were avowed vegetarians, D'Emic assumed their teeth would be well worn from munching copious amounts of tough plant matter.

The next step was to break apart the jaws and remove not only the 30-odd visible teeth individually, but whatever backups were embedded in the sockets below. In other words, he needed to pull some teeth.

In addition to the large number of teeth in the pipeline, D'Emic and his team were interested in how quickly those teeth would come in.

D'Emic also noticed that more recent sauropods had evolved smaller, narrower teeth that got replaced a lot faster, like Diplodocus. He wondered: Why the shift?

Sauropods didn't actually chew their salad — they clipped it off with their teeth and then swallowed it whole. Perhaps having teeth turn over faster kept them fresh for the hard work of cutting vegetation off trees or bushes, D'Emic said.

If Diplodocus grazed vegetation close to the ground, it would have accidentally eaten a fair amount of dirt — and the sauropod's narrow teeth could have been an adaptation for this grittier diet, he said. With Diplodocus eating plants down low, Camarasaurus could have foraged up high, providing enough room for everyone.

"Last night I had a salad that I grew in my own yard for the first time, and I really had to wash the lettuce carefully, because there's this grit in it," said Sereno, who also studies sauropods. "It's exactly what we're talking about. You put your muzzle down to the ground and you're going to be incorporating these sand grits that wear your teeth down."
ST. LOUIS—The freshman-year roommates at Colgate University would talk about what they hoped to do after college. They were just 18 or 19, their paths barely formed. But they had some ideas. One wanted to be a lawyer. Another, a music producer. And then there was Ryan C. Fogle from Richmond Heights near St. Louis. He wanted to join the FBI or CIA.

"Those were his goals in life," Ben Flicker, one of those roommates who is now an attorney in Denver, recalled Wednesday. "He had this sense of service, of duty. And if he reached the FBI or CIA, that was the highest level of duty he could imagine giving to his country."

The sky over Disneyland in Anaheim and Walt Disney World in Orlando is "national defense airspace." Intentionally violating Mickey and Minnie's airspace, the alerts warn, could result in interception, interrogation and federal prosecution.

These no-fly zones are known as temporary flight restrictions, like the ones that surround the president when he travels or those put in place above Ferguson, Missouri, during protests over the summer. Wildfires, air shows and large sporting events regularly get temporary flight restrictions.

The FAA's leader, Michael P. Huerta, testified before Congress last year that if not for the 2003 law, he would eliminate no-fly zones over Disney properties. An FAA spokeswoman said last week that the agency also would like to take a closer look at no-fly zones over sporting events, which were made permanent by the 2003 law.

Defenders of the zones have said the Disney parks merit special protection because of their importance to American culture and the large crowds they draw. Critics say that the zones, which each cover a three-mile radius, would be useless against a true terror attack and that the restrictions instead mostly harm pilots who tow advertising banners.

"The sole and exclusive motivation for seeking these restrictions is for the safety and enjoyment of our guests," Disney spokeswoman Leslie Goodman told the Orlando Sentinel after the restrictions were created. But Goodman added that "enjoyment" included keeping out "banner ads from trial lawyers" and pilots "buzzing the parks."

The no-fly zones have been challenged in court, without success.

"No building or wall protects bare flesh from the impact of even a small plane. No window or duct tape protects lungs from the invasion of airborne chemicals or germs," wrote two federal attorneys, one from the Justice Department in Washington and the other an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida. Disney's place in the American psyche, they argued, warranted the three-mile protective space.

More than a decade later, the attorney who fought the Disney no-fly zone, Steve Crampton, chuckled when he was reminded of the government's arguments. "Reading it now, it's kind of a 'you've got to be kidding me, right?' reaction. Give me a break," said Crampton, chief counsel for the American Center for Constitutional Rights.

"In the past 10, 12 years since those cases were argued, we've seen no further terrorist attacks of the type that took place at the World Trade Center and no real threat in these fly-over zones. I would say, today, that the case for protecting Disney is even weaker than it was when we argued those cases," Crampton said.
"Our expectation for cast members to uphold character integrity has never changed," Disney spokesman Bryan Malenius said. Disney did not have any further comment.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Every day, usually more than once, Curtis Doyle reminds his dad about the trip they're planning for next summer to Walt Disney World. It's an obvious source of excitement for Doyle, who is 27 years old and has severe autism.

It might seem a minor change to most families. But it's not to Brad Doyle, whose son, like many people with intellectual disabilities, has a tendency to hyper-fixate on things and become frustrated when they are denied him, sometimes melting down in outbursts during which he bites his own hands.

Across the country, parents of children with disabilities are reacting with alarm to news that Disney will soon end its "Guest Assistance Card" program. Some have launched online petitions and letter-writing campaigns.

By contrast, both Universal Orlando and SeaWorld Orlando generally require disabled visitors to return to rides at certain times — the model Disney will begin using Oct. 9.

Tourists and annual pass holders are flooding Disneyland and California Adventure in large numbers, causing headaches for guests and park officials. Waits for rides often stretch over an hour, and visitors are having to park in remote structures, particularly on Sundays.

Industry experts say the crowding problem leaves Walt Disney Co. with two options: Keep raising rates until attendance becomes manageable, or expand the park.

Over the weekend, the Anaheim park raised single-day ticket prices by $4 to $96 and temporarily halted new sales of a popular annual pass for Southern California residents. Disneyland officials say they have no current plans for a new Anaheim park, but that hasn't stopped speculation.

Many longtime park watchers say now may be the time to dust off plans, dating to 2000, to build a third park on a 78-acre site just south of Disney's complex.

Speigel said theme parks across the country could see double-digit increases — as much as 25 percent — in attendance this year.

In Southern California, Universal Studios Hollywood also recently increased its one-day ticket prices, from $84 to $92, just $4 shy of Disneyland's new prices.

But it was Disneyland's suspension of sales of its $379 Southern California Annual Passport that is expected to play the biggest role in reducing crowds. The pass offered access to the park 215 days of the year, including Sundays.

Local pass holders often crowd the parks, leaving little space for out-of-town travelers who typically stay in Disney hotels and spend more on souvenirs. The program gained popularity in 2008, when the company began offering a monthly payment plan.

"Pass holders use the park differently than others," said Adrienne Vincent-Phoenix, an annual pass holder and chief executive of the Disney fan site MousePlanet.com. "You go to the park like you would go to hang out at the mall with your friends."

The move to suspend sales of the annual passports, industry experts say, is an attempt to reduce Sunday numbers and encourage local residents to visit during the week, when crowds are smaller.

Disney continues to sell a $289 annual pass — not including weekend visits — for Southern California residents. Disneyland officials say they have no plans to suspend the sales of any other passes.

"It's a challenging situation," said John Gerner, managing director of Leisure Business Associates, a theme park consultant. "Disney doesn't want to be seen as taking advantage of customers, but they have an obligation to try to make as much profit from their park."

Other pass holders complained that the park has not added new attractions to justify the higher prices.

SHANGHAI — The mantra for Disney executives working on the company's $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney resort has, for years, been to create something both "authentically Disney and distinctly Chinese." As Disney Chairman and Chief Executive Bob Iger unveiled a huge scale model for the media in Shanghai last week, he said he believed the company had attained the "perfect balance."

Ten years ago, the company opened Hong Kong Disneyland, which incorporated a number of Chinese elements including feng shui into its design and sought to cater to local clientele with Chinese food and other services. But it encountered a number of well-publicized problems, including long lines on Chinese holidays and a brouhaha over whether to serve shark's fin soup (it eventually opted not to, after an outcry from environmentalists).

Only when the gates are thrown open next year will planners know if they chose properly. Among the decisions: Unlike in Hong Kong Disneyland, there's no Main Street U.S.A. (which probably wouldn't sit well with mainland authorities sensitive about excessive American cultural influence in China).

There are no planned roller-coasters or other major rides based solely on Chinese stories or cultural elements, but the park's architecture aims to nod to Chinese tastes in various ways.

Most state laws don't directly deal with cyclists using cellphones or texting. But at least seven states — California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island and Virginia — specifically include bicyclists in their laws restricting or banning the use of headsets or earplugs. An eighth state, Pennsylvania, prohibits people driving vehicles from using headsets, a prohibition that likely applies to bicycles, which are defined as vehicles in that state, AAA says.

Ever since Mattel first introduced Barbie in 1959, she's been forced to hobble around in high heels. Even when you took off her stilettos or platform shoes, her plastic feet remained in a rigid tiptoe stance.

The "Pink Petals" Barbie wears a feathery pink skirt and white tank top, along with "an amazing pair of silver flats and the perfect matching silver bag."

Although the ranks of lawmakers on Capitol Hill remain overwhelmingly white, both chambers of Congress have made gains in diversity, building on a record established by the 113th Congress.

SOUNION, Greece — Few forms of attire less evoke the grace and beauty of dance than scuba gear. With their heavy tanks of compressed air, hoses, gauges, wetsuits, fins and masks, divers seem more like astronauts than ballerinas.

The dancers — mostly French and Greek and including three who are disabled and three children — float into and out of formations in choreography that melds the underwater world with the stage. Hand movements turn their breath into a fine mist of bubbles. Music, composed with the conductivity of sound through water in mind, floods the circular seabed stage from two submerged speakers.

Some changes in the works, such as the use of new technologies and allowing mid-level medical providers to perform some functions usually reserved for doctors and dentists, should improve health care access in the long run. "In the meantime," said Linda Rosenberg, president of the National Council for Behavioral Health, "people are going to suffer."

HARTFORD, Conn. — When Porter the dog tries to figure out why his owner has placed a toy bone under a bucket, his response might provide some insight about human development, autism and other learning disabilities.

That's the hope of Laurie Santos, who runs the Canine Cognition Center at Yale, which opened in December. She pointed to the 4-year-old chocolate Lab mix, brought in by psychology grad student Kristi Leimgruber. Porter is growing up in the same kind of environment as human children, Santos said, so comparing how he learns with the way people learn can tell us a lot about human development.

"So much more than primates, dogs are more cued into what we care about and what we know," Santos said. "And they might have been shaped in a way that's very different from any other animal species in part because, in a sense, they (behave) more like a human child who's cued in (to humans) than, say, a chimpanzee."

For all that we ask of dogs — loyalty, companionship, slipper-fetching — rarely have we asked what drives dogs. That's starting to change in the world of academia, where the dog's status as a research subject has increased in recent years.

Dogs aren't known to be the most graceful of drinkers — place a bowl of water in front of a thirsty canine and you're likely to see much of its contents splattered across the floor. But researchers who have studied the exquisite lapping strategy of the cat have found that even though dogs seem sloppy when they have a drink, they have a clever strategy of their own.

When it comes to getting a mouthful of water, different animals have distinct strategies, said research co-author Sunghwan Jung, an assistant professor at Virginia Tech.

They videotaped canines lapping up water from above and below the water's surface. Then, to further mimic and model the movement of the dogs' tongues, they used tongue-shaped glass tubes and plunged them into the water the way the dogs did.

Unlike porcupines, dogs are a relatively hands-on (actually, paws-on) species, both with one another and with us. YouTube has numerous videos of dogs essentially saying, "Just keep petting me, please. Yes, that's it…more."

But this relationship is not one-sided. Many studies find that positive interactions between people and dogs can be beneficial for both species. Increases in endorphin (beta-endorphin), oxytocin and dopamine — neurochemicals associated with positive feelings and bonding — have been observed in both dogs and people after enjoyable interactions like petting, playing and talking. Essentially, interacting with a dog, particularly a known dog, can have some of the same psychophysiological markers as when two emotionally attached people spend time together.

But do certain types of interactions have an outsized impact? Dogs are incredibly attentive to human faces and, in some cases, even specific facial expressions. This seemingly routine, benign behavior — your dog turning to gaze on your beautiful face as you do his or hers — could actually hold a very important piece of the puzzle in our relationship with dogs, suggests a study published this week in Science.

The new study, by Miho Nagasawa of Azabu University in Japan and colleagues, builds on Nagasawa's previous work, published in Hormones and Behavior in 2009, that found owners and dogs sharing a long mutual gaze had higher levels of oxytocin in their urine than owners of dogs giving a shorter gaze. (Oxytocin, a humble peptide of nine amino acids that is sometimes called the "cuddle hormone," has been implicated in social bonding and is instrumental to the cascade of hormonal changes leading up to and following birth.) Nagasawa and her colleagues concluded that their finding was "a manifestation of attachment behavior." By describing it in this context, the researchers postulated that gaze between a dog and human (particularly a known human), will share similar properties to mother–infant relationships.

A story emerges — and probably one that will make dog lovers cheer: Mutual gaze between dogs and the people who care for them produces a very similar physiological profile to what's observed between mothers and infants. This overlap could both contribute to and facilitate our intense and deep-seated relationship with dogs.

Reflecting on her findings in an interview conducted via Skype, Nagasawa recommends that "dog owners not just say commands at their dogs, but to build up the relationship (and) consider the potentially beneficial role that mutual gaze can hold."

MENOMONEE FALLS, Wis. — Jerry Witt survived 365 days in Vietnam because of his buddies Skip and Satan.

Skip was a German shepherd/collie mix, while Satan was a black Labrador retriever. And when Skip was killed, the loss of his buddy felt like a punch to the gut to Witt, an Army dog handler assigned to support 1st Cavalry Division infantry units.

Carol Singer and a friend started War Dogs in 1999 after she researched the history of Doberman pinschers during World War II. Singer, who has a 9-year-old Doberman named Bella, works at Menomonee Falls pet store Friends of Nature and through her network of dog owners she spread the word of War Dogs.

PITTSBURGH — The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is looking into the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium's use of dogs to herd its African elephants after receiving a complaint from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

"We have video footage (taken at) the Pittsburgh Zoo that very clearly shows the elephants exhibiting threat displays, in which their ears go out and they trumpet as the dogs go out, chase them and apparently nip at their feet," said Brittany Peet, PETA's deputy director of captive animal law enforcement in Washington, D.C.

Zoo spokeswoman Tracy Gray issued a statement defending the use of dogs, saying it was part of "providing the best care possible for our African elephants."

"To advance and improve the care that we provide for our elephants, we introduced two Australian cattle dogs into our elephant program three years ago," Gray said. "Both the dogs and elephants are working well together, and the dogs have been a wonderful addition to our program."

Gray added, "The primary reason the herding dogs are working with our team is for the safety of our staff. These relationships can be thought of in terms of traditional shepherding practices. In this case, our primary elephant keeper, Willie Thieson, represents the shepherd; the elephants represent the flock; and the Australian cattle dogs assist the shepherd."

"Over half of accredited zoos in this country use protected contact to manage elephants, in which handlers are separated from the animals with barriers and using positive reinforcement techniques," Peet said. "Unfortunately, the Pittsburgh Zoo is doubling down on their choice to continue using free contact by recklessly introducing dogs to an already dangerous dynamic between elephants and staff … With two fatal animal attacks at the Pittsburgh Zoo since 2002, including one by an elephant that is still on exhibit, the Pittsburgh Zoo should be working to protect animals, employees and visitors by barring all direct contact with elephants and not experimenting with dogs' lives."

In February, the USDA fined the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium $4,550 following an investigation into the November 2012 death of 2-year-old Maddox Derkosh, who was mauled by the zoo's African painted dogs after he fell into their exhibit. The USDA ruled that the exhibit did not have sufficient distance and barriers between the animals and the general public.

SEATTLE — When Daniel Promislow jogs with his Weimaraner, Silver, it pains him to see age creeping up on the 11-year-old canine.

"Month by month, he gets slower and slower," said Promislow, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Washington (UW). His other dog, Frisbee, still frolics like a pup — but at 10, she also qualifies as elderly.

Some experts believe our ancestors in the Middle East and elsewhere were naturally drawn to small, furry wolf pups and seized them as novelties. Others suggest they were raised as a source of meat in early agrarian societies in Asia.

Tracing the exact path of dog evolution has been extremely difficult. Ancient dog remains are hard to distinguish from wolf remains, and frequent interbreeding between dogs and wolves further complicates matters. Add to that mankind's zealous breeding of dogs to enhance specific traits and behaviors and the genetic water becomes very cloudy.

But past the rows of one-room concrete buildings with peeling paint, and beyond the roads littered with garbage and stray dogs, a sprawling park emerged. Kids there scrambled around the ragged fields, their shouts in Spanish piercing the afternoon heat. Bats cracked and balls thudded into leather gloves.

LOS ANGELES — It's a quandary faced by anyone who's been asked for money by a homeless person: Will my spare change stave off hunger or support an addiction?

"It's therapeutic," said Chambers, 77. "I watch the pencil and things just flow out of it — words that rhyme and pictures that shade themselves. Sometimes, I'm not even concentrating on making a picture. I'm just putting lines on a sheet of paper."

Chambers said he started drawing in art classes in high school and continued through law school. A law professor noticed his work on a piece of poster board and suggested Chambers pursue a career as an artist. "In my mind, he was telling me anything he could to get me out of his school," Chambers said.

His collection features portraits of John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a smiling young mother with her infant son. His 2001 rendition of Elvis Presley was so detailed that a Capitol staffer framed it and hung it in her office. Other sketches are more political or function as social commentary, such as Joe Camel with skull and a pack of cigarettes.

Despite the praise, Chambers insists he's not an artist but a "drawer," because he lacks formal training.

Reading, Pennsylvania, native Jeff Brown had the opposite experience. His fiancee believed the dress to be white and gold. He took up the blue and black banner, and it "felt good" to be eventually proven right, he said.

Torcellini, 31, leads a crew of test, or "safety," drivers who are legally required to ride in Google's fleet of 48 robot cars. They take control only in emergencies. Otherwise, they make observations that help the Internet company's engineers program the cars to navigate the roads without human assistance.

Bret Chilcott of Kansas-based AgEagle, which sells unmanned aerial vehicles and the software to help operate them, says his company took its first orders last year. Now it has a backlog of several hundred orders. He says the technology has transformed the market during that short period.

There's the DJI Phantom 2 Vision, an aircraft with four propellers and a high-definition camera that can fly for miles on autopilot. Priced at $1,200, this drone recently was named a top holiday gift for 2014 by USA Today.

Looking to entertain the kids without spending three figures? No problem. Right now you can drive to Radio Shack and buy the store brand's Surveyor Drone. It's red. It shoots video. With the tap of a button, it'll even do barrel rolls. And it's cheap. Normally priced at $69.99, this marvel of modern aviation is on sale for the holidays for $59.

"I bought them because they're cool," said Rob Powley of Mahwah, New Jersey, who bought some drones preassembled and built some others. He enjoys his drones so much that he forgets how many he actually owns. "It's amazing what you can do with a drone. And they're getting better all the time."

This year, the FAA has approved dozens of exemptions for agricultural aerial-drone businesses, allowing the fledgling technology to gain acceptance in the marketplace.

It's illegal to use drones commercially without an FAA permit and right now there are almost none for commercial operators. Personal drone use generally is allowed on an individual's own property or on the property of someone else who extends permission, but those rules vary from state to state. Drones are not allowed in U.S. airspace, which means they must be kept below a certain altitude and out of certain areas.

One of the challenges for the FAA's drone permitting plans is that unlike manned aircraft, which come in standard classes and are usually used for a common set of jobs, drones can come in almost any size and the agency is just starting to see the beginning of their potential applications.

There's a reason that companies are proposing unconventional new uses for drones, according to experts. Drones come in all sizes, and many are smaller than manned aircraft, cheaper to purchase and operate, and can be used in situations that might normally be off-limits because of potential dangers to pilots.

What remains of the drone is sitting in a Los Angeles Police Department property room, waiting for its owner to claim it. If the owner steps forward, police will give him back his drone but do little else. Flying a drone in public is not illegal, police concluded.

"It was kind of an eye-opener for us that this is something we really need to pay attention to," said LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith about the drone outside the Kings game. "It's certainly something that's growing enormously."

[Drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) use is becoming an issue as the unmanned aircraft become more popular, especially as a way for hobbyists to create videos. YouTube is filled with drone videos taking in the views of Yosemite, prompting rangers last month to issue a public notice saying the machines are banned. At the Grand Canyon recently, a drone crashed, stunning visitors who were there to take in the sunset.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. — As Jason Thrasher lowered his helicopter to a park with seven firefighters aboard, he saw what he thought was another firefighting chopper battling a blaze that was threatening homes.

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection pilot suddenly identified the object as a four-rotor drone only 10 feet from his windshield, forcing him to make a hard left to avoid a collision about 500 feet above ground, according to a report he filed the next day.

The near-miss last September in Nevada City, California, about 60 miles northeast of Sacramento, California, explains why drones have quickly become a serious nuisance and concern for firefighting pilots and other first responders, fueling calls for more oversight and self-policing in the skies.

Under FAA guidelines, drone hobbyists should fly no higher than 400 feet, stay clear of stadiums and people, and avoid flying within 5 miles of airports. During wildfires and other emergencies, the FAA imposes temporary restrictions.

The prospect of public shaming may be the best deterrent, said Jon Resnick, spokesman for SZ DJI Technology Co., one of the largest consumer drone makers.

"Technology can only do so much," he said. "At a certain point, common sense needs to take hold."
THREE RIVERS, Calif. — Tourists and animal lovers hoping to see a bear in Sequoia National Park this fall probably stand a better chance of spotting one in this tiny town at the park's entrance.

Chas Haws' eyes bugged out as he recalled his surprise coming face to face with a bear before dawn as he walked to Antoinette's Coffee and Goodies shop along the main road one day.

Private lakes for a few wealthy suburbanites are a vestige of a past ideal, critics say, one that is inappropriate for these dry days.

But the drought forced California farmers to fallow 500,000 acres of land in 2014. And the number could double in 2015, experts say.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Sacramento gets about as much annual rainfall as arid Flagstaff, Ariz., but its lush lawns are modeled on those of rain-soaked England.

The capital's turf tradition is deeply rooted and is even enshrined in the bylaws of various homeowners associations. That may be starting to change, however. Nudged by local governments worried about water shortages, home builders and homeowners associations are showing increased willingness to embrace the drought-tolerant landscapes that more naturally suit California.

Cities, state lawmakers, and homeowners are exploring alternatives that, should they take hold, could transform the Sacramento area's front yards in years to come and reduce water usage.

LOS ANGELES — Mayor Eric Garcetti on Tuesday challenged Los Angeles residents, businesses and city agencies to cut water use by 20 percent over the next 2 1/2 years and warned of new water restrictions if conservation targets aren't met.

Experts praised Garcetti for setting specific deadlines for water reductions, something that Brown did not do. Garcetti calls for water consumption to be measured on July 1, 2015, on Jan. 1, 2016, and Jan. 1, 2017. At those points, the directive targets water usage reductions of 10 percent, 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively.

Los Angeles is now in Phase 2 of its mandatory water conservation ordinance, which limits watering to no more than three times a week.

The Department of Water and Power has increased the number of inspectors looking for water wasters from one to four. But the department has pledged to take a gentle approach, choosing to educate and warn violators rather than issue a fine.

SAN FRANCISCO — Paul Brown sets out before sunrise to patrol Sacramento for circumstantial evidence that someone is wasting California's scarcest resource. It may be a moist sidewalk, or a flooded curb gutter, or a suspiciously damp driveway.

Every so often he catches a lawn-care infraction in action: sprinklers whirring on a city-mandated no-watering day.

"I'm not sure I understand the problem," he said, showing off his empty swimming pool. "I'm not able to enjoy my summer this year. I shower twice a week. We don't flush the toilet every time. We use our water very minimally."

California's epic drought, four years old and seemingly endless, is getting on people's nerves. Regulators issued rules last month for cutbacks that Gov. Jerry Brown ordered in April, marking the first time all the state's 39 million inhabitants have been forced to conserve.

A mix of steps is being taken to achieve the goal, such as dictating when outdoor taps can be switched on or imposing surcharges on residences or businesses that exceed per-gallon monthly caps, and Californians are having a hodgepodge of reactions. One is drought-shaming, which, of course, is a hashtag on Twitter: "#DroughtShame."

Drought has been a constant in California. One drought in the mid-1800s devastated the cattle industry, and an extended dry spell in the 1930s stoked tensions between Lake Tahoe property owners and people downstream in Nevada who sent a steam shovel and a Reno police officer to cut a trench through the lake's rim so more of its contents would flow toward them.

A 2015 rendition is occurring in Madera County, near Fresno, where some residents are using irrigation tubing to steal water from neighbors. "It's become a very valuable commodity," said Madera County District Attorney David Linn, who recently set up a water-crime task force to investigate such thefts, including from fire hydrants.

SHANGHAI — Chef-turned-food writer Christopher St. Cavish is striding toward the front door of the Welcome Revered Guests restaurant when he stops dead in his tracks. "They don't like me here," he says, frowning.

It's not that he has panned the eatery. In fact, he gave it his highest rating. Rather, what has annoyed the staff here is the way St. Cavish judges the quintessential Shanghai snack: soup dumplings known as xiao long bao.

"Mr. Duncan succumbed to an insidious disease, Ebola. He fought courageously in this battle. Our professionals, the doctors and nurses in the unit, as well as the entire Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas community, are also grieving his passing. We have offered the family our support and condolences at this difficult time," the hospital said.

Dallas Judge Clay Jenkins, the top elected official in the county, also expressed his grief.

RALEIGH, N.C. — For now, North Carolina State University's newest — and strangest — library exists mainly in 98,000 glass vials and slim envelopes of cloth samples.

LOS ANGELES — Astronomers studying dying stars' colorful cast-offs have discovered a mysterious pattern: Some planetary nebulae in the Milky Way galaxy's central bulge are strangely aligned, according to a study to be published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

The findings by two University of Manchester researchers provide insight into how the stars behind these nebulae formed — and what unknown forces near the Milky Way heart could have pulled them into formation, said astrophysicist and lead author Bryan Rees.

A dying star's nebula is a sight to behold. Like a flower shedding its petals, an aging star casts off its outer layers, surrounding itself with cloud-like shells of gas and dust that seed the universe with heavier elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. These ethereal structures are created by stars with masses of about one to eight suns and often rendered in breathtaking color. (Stars that are more massive than eight suns tend to explode in supernovae, which enriched the early universe with even heavier elements, such as cobalt, nickel and iron.)

But these shells aren't just interstellar eye candy. Planetary nebulae (so-called because astronomer William Herschel mistakenly thought they looked rather like gas giants such as Uranus, which he also discovered) can tell scientists much about the environment in which they were formed. Nebulae reflect their stars' individual characteristics, whether they're waltzing around in a binary pair and whether they have any orbiting planets tugging at them.

That's sort of what could be happening here, astronomers say. The bipolar nebulae were probably two-star systems with strong magnetic fields — like the magnetized nails, unable to resist a powerful magnetic force in the galactic bulge around when it was forming stars around 8-13 billion years ago. The elliptical nebulae, lacking this strong magnetic field, remained unmoved.

If you were to look at these bipolar nebulae along the plane of the galaxy, Rees said, they would look like hourglasses lying on their sides.

There on the fuselage, about two-thirds of the way from the plane's nose to its tail, is a rectangular patch that shines a peculiar silver on the aircraft's dusky skin. Could it be a clue — the clue — to what happened when Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan vanished somewhere over the trackless Pacific Ocean three months later?

Longtime Earhart investigator Ric Gillespie thinks so. He believes that the silvery patch reveals an unrecorded repair performed on Earhart's plane during her stopover in Miami. And he hopes that modern computer enhancements of that part of the photo will link it to a piece of possible airplane wreckage discovered a quarter century ago on a tiny Pacific island in the area where Earhart disappeared.

"If we can match a rivet pattern from the repair in the photograph to a rivet pattern on the wreckage, I think it would be beyond dispute that Noonan and Earhart weren't lost at sea, but made it to the island," said Gillespie, the executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR).

Her second attempt, this time eastbound, also had problems right from the start. She landed at the wrong airport in Miami, in what was then known as the 36th Street Airport (now part of Miami International) rather than the bigger Miami Municipal Airport just south of Opa-locka (now a park named for Earhart). Her landing on May 24, 1937, was rough and she stayed in Miami for a week while the plane underwent repairs.

One of them, it appears, was the removal of a specially installed window in the rear of the airplane that navigator Noonan used to take sightings on the sun and stars, the method by which pilots found their way over unmapped oceans, jungles and desert in the days before radar and GPS. The window is clearly visible in photos of Earhart's plane taken in California at the start of her trip, and even in some Herald photos shot after her arrival in Miami.

But in the photo shot just before her June 1, 1937, takeoff for Puerto Rico, the window is gone, replaced by that odd silvery plate.

"I think the window must have been broken or compromised by the hard landing in Miami," Gillespie said. "It wasn't standard equipment and they found out it would take a while to replace it, so they just took it out and patched the fuselage instead."

WASHINGTON — Scientists have found fossil-like hints that some kind of life existed on Earth 4.1 billion years ago — when the planet was a mere volcanic toddler. That's 300 million years earlier for life to pop up than previously thought.

Not only does that change what scientists thought Earth was like soon after it formed 4.5 billion years ago, but gives them reason to theorize that life itself is more plentiful throughout the universe because it seemed to start up so quickly.

"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth," Hedges wrote in an email, "then it could be common in the universe."
LOS ANGELES — Sifting through observations from tens of thousands of distant stars, astronomers say they have discovered the first definitive Earth-size planet that orbits in a habitable zone where water could exist in liquid form — a necessary condition for life as we know it.

Experts don't know if the planet, described in Friday's edition of the journal Science, actually has water or a protective atmosphere. They don't even know its mass. But they said the landmark discovery raises the distinct possibility that a bumper crop of Earth-like planets is waiting to be found much closer to home, including around temperamental stars that until recently were considered inhospitable to life.

"This is really a tip-of-the-iceberg discovery," said study co-author Jason Rowe, an astronomer at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who spent a year analyzing data gathered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope. They're still looking for more in the Kepler data — but after finding the planet known as Kepler-186f, "we can infer that other ones are likely to exist. And that's going to be the job of future missions to find (them)."

"This is an historic discovery of the first Earth-size planet found in the habitable zone around its star," University of California, Berkeley, astronomer Geoffrey Marcy wrote in an email. "This is the best case for a habitable planet yet found. The results are absolutely rock solid."

KATHMANDU, Nepal — Binod Tiwari leaps out of an SUV onto the busy Araniko Highway and stops in front of a foot-wide crack in the pavement.

The best way to learn how to build safer structures, Tiwari says, is to head to the disaster zones where they have failed.

The Obama administration is developing additional screening protocols for airline passengers both overseas and in the United States to control infectious diseases such as Ebola, President Barack Obama said Monday.

At a televised news conference to announce his new 17-member task force to deal with infectious diseases, Perry said federal officials should tighten screening procedures at all U.S. points of entry. Screeners would take travelers' temperatures and conduct other assessments to determine their overall health.

"Dr. Kent Brantly, a doctor working for Samaritan's Purse, and Nancy Writebol, a missionary with SIM, are currently in serious condition. The two Americans who contracted Ebola in Liberia remain in the country ... but medical evacuation efforts are underway and should be completed by early next week," read a prepared statement Friday from Samaritan's Purse.

There is no vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, which causes fever, vomiting, diarrhea and massive internal bleeding, and has a fatality rate of 60 to 90 percent. It is spread through direct contact with the blood, organs or other secretions of infected people.

People who are infected with this hemorrhagic virus experience sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and headaches, along with vomiting and diarrhea. The disease can also cause kidney and liver failure, as well as internal bleeding.

What researchers do know, thanks to new findings published March 26, is that the virus is not mutating particularly quickly. Despite an earlier analysis that suggested the virus currently roiling West Africa may be mutating at a rate twice as fast as in the past, this new more comprehensive snapshot of the virus implies that, fortunately, Ebola is not evolving at a rate that would automatically upend the bevy of targeted vaccines and therapies in clinical trials.

To underscore his assertion that New Yorkers have nothing to worry about, de Blasio sent a Twitter photograph of himself riding a crowded subway car.

He and Bassett said they had confidence in the self-monitoring system recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for people returning from Ebola-hit areas. It advises them to isolate themselves for 21 days, Ebola's incubation period, and to take their temperatures twice daily.

"He's a doctor," Cuomo said of Spencer, and even he didn't follow the guidelines for the quarantine. "Let's be honest. So we have to do more."

DALLAS — A Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas health care worker who had "extensive contact" with the first Ebola patient to die in the United States has contracted the disease.

Frieden said exposure can result from a "single inadvertent slip." He cautioned: "Unfortunately, it is possible in the coming days we will see additional cases of Ebola" in health care workers.

DALLAS — A man who traveled from Liberia to visit family members in Texas tested positive for Ebola on Tuesday, marking the outbreak's first diagnosis outside of Africa, health officials said.

The United States and Britain are sending troops and equipment to West Africa to help curb the spread of Ebola, officials said Monday, as the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the outbreak is outstripping the capacity to respond in one of the worst-hit countries.

Absenteeism at Lake Pointe Elementary soared to 40 percent on Thursday, Courtney said, and 28 percent of the students were absent again on Friday. Normally, Courtney said the district average is about 4 percent of students absent on any given day.

LOME, Togo — Fearful Togo officials have asked the African soccer confederation to move a game out of Ebola-affected Guinea as the outbreak of the deadly disease threatens to badly disrupt the African Cup's final qualifying round.

The appointment of a political fix-it man with flimsy medical credentials as Ebola czar confirmed the White House response is more political than responsible.

In an hour of need, our assortment of national and international public health administrators — including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the United Nation's World Health Organization (WHO) — dropped the ball with deadly consequences.

That's due to the way government bureaucrats generally allocate public resources and the poor coordination plaguing the agencies that are tasked with fighting the epidemic on the front line.

While these issues are real and problematic, they take the focus away from the CDC's original mission and divert resources away from emerging disease response.

But funding for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the NIH department that actually researches infectious diseases, has retained stable levels of roughly $4.5 billion since 2003.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama was right to dispatch U.S. military units to help combat an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. But he did it for the wrong reasons.

Obama called it a "national security" mission — a clear misuse of the term. Americans should be wary of Washington's growing tendency to make every project a priority simply by appending "security" to the issue.

Further, the U.S. military undertakes these kinds of missions quite frequently, both at home and abroad. Be it sandbagging during storms or delivering supplies and rescue services after disaster strikes, our military is skilled at alleviating non-military emergencies. It is not the principal job for our armed forces, but these are appropriate auxiliary missions — tasks to be done on an as-needed and as-available basis.

Without question, the West African crisis is a suitable use of U.S. forces. The Pentagon can quickly deploy expertise, support and infrastructure that will help local organizations stop the spread of the disease.

And there's self-interest here as well. The best way to keep more Ebola cases from checking in at the nearest Holiday Inn is to help quell the outbreak at its source. Alternative containment strategies — like banning travel and yanking visas — are much blunter instruments.

Words are important, and so are actions. Mislabeling missions, as Obama did earlier in calling our offensive against the extremist group Islamic State a "humanitarian" mission, suggests a dangerous confusion about the nature of true national security risks and the principle function of our military.

Militarization of humanitarian aid risks involvement in internal disputes. All three countries at the center of the Ebola epidemic are politically unstable.

QUITO, Ecuador — For decades, Freddy Ehlers has been ubiquitous in this small Andean nation. He's been a television star for more than 30 years, the minister of tourism, the secretary general of the Andean Community and a two-time presidential candidate. Now, at 69, Ehlers is embarking on what might be his most ambitious job yet: making the country happier.

By the end of that night, 65 years ago this month, the announcer would still be alive but at least six others would be dead as irate mobs discovered they had fallen for a radio hoax — and embarrassed security forces either refused, or were unable, to come to the broadcasters' aid.

But the program, based on H.G. Wells' classic science fiction novel, had a lesser-known and more deadly ripple effect throughout Latin America, where radio pioneers tried to emulate its success.

In 1944, in Chile, an adaptation of the radio drama was blamed for panicking thousands and giving an electrician in Valparaiso, named Jose Villaroel, a fatal heart attack, according to a Newsweek article from the time.

But in the tiny Andean nation of Ecuador, the stunt was pulled off so convincingly that even the authorities seem to have fallen for the story — with tragic results.

Moments later, Leonardo Paez, one of Quito's best known musicians and radio personalities, was rushed to the scene. As Paez broadcast "live" from Cotocollao's central plaza, a long "green arm" emerged from the alien craft, and then Paez was fried by a bolt of light.

Soon, Ribadeneira's family had joined the throngs of other Quitenos trying to get out of the city as the radio reported that the alien clash with the armed forces was expected to release a toxic cloud.

Paez was only in his 30s at the time but had already made a name for himself as an artistic powerhouse. He was a poet, playwright, reporter, radio actor and songwriter who composed some of Ecuador's most emblematic music. His classic "La Tuna Quitena" is still played during festivals.

In the wake of "The War of the Worlds" tragedy, Paez would receive much of the blame. At the time, he was accused of priming the ground for panic by planting stories in the local newspaper and failing to warn the audience that they were listening to fiction.

"There are so many stories about him, but most of them are just legends," said Ximena Paez, 63, the broadcaster's daughter. Ximena says her father never tried to hide the fact that it was a radio play, but that the owners of the station tried to frame him as they downplayed their own role in allowing the program to air.

What is known is that on the night of Feb. 12, 1949, the city was seized by panic as the show kept upping the stakes. Radio Quito patched in other broadcasters who were also "reporting" the arrival of alien craft, and an actor playing the archbishop of Quito only fueled the hysteria. But there were also real acts that added to the effect. With President Galo Plaza Lasso out of town, someone apparently ordered police and firefighters to head to Cotocollao. The Red Cross followed suit, according to Ribadeneira, who wrote a brief history of the event.

It didn't take long for the radio station to realize that it had overplayed its hand, but when it shut down the show and tried to reassure the audience it was just a dramatization, it only enraged the crowd. Soon, a mob surrounded the radio station in downtown Quito, which also housed El Comercio newspaper, and set it ablaze.

"We saw an enormous fire," Ribadeneira recalls. "And we could hear the announcer, whose name was Luis Beltran, calling for help. He was saying 'Please let the firefighters through,' but the people wouldn't let them pass."

Ximena Paez said her father always believed that security didn't react because they were embarrassed over having fallen for the hoax. Most of the key players, including Paez, Alcaraz and Beltran, survived. But at least six people died, including the radio's pianist and violin player. Paez's girlfriend was also killed in the fire, according to Ribadeneira's account.

Ximena said her father never hid his role in "The War of the Worlds," but that it was a bittersweet memory for him.

"He was proud of it because it was such a good artistic production that people believed it — and that was his job as a radio actor," she said. "But it was a tragedy because people died."
Battery cages provide each hen an average of only 67 square inches of floor space, smaller than an 8x10 sheet of paper. The 2010 law, which goes into effect Jan. 1, 2015, cites the increased risk of salmonella from birds in large flocks in confined spaces.

While the six-state appeal makes its way through the court, egg producers around the country are scrambling to meet California's requirements by Jan. 1. The 2010 law did not specify what size or type of cage is acceptable, which has led to confusion. Many in the industry believe the EU standard of 116 square inches per hen is about right. That provides each hen space slightly smaller than a sheet of legal paper, which is 8.5x14 inches.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Three weeks ago, if you ordered a three-egg omelet from Roxanne's Cafe in the Kansas City suburb of Parkville, you would probably get a five-egg omelet instead. Cooks weren't too concerned about how many eggs they scooped into the frying pan, and owner Roxanne Gray gladly allowed it.

Consumers have become increasingly concerned with protein-rich diets, and last year each person ate 263 eggs on average, a 30-year high for egg consumption.

Cox, who was then 25, switched some of the family's production to organic, which brought premium prices. Then, in 2009, he heard about a Texas startup called Vital Farms that wanted to produce pasture-raised eggs and sell them across the country. "Here were guys doing something completely different," Cox remembers. "It was just crazy enough to work." He signed on to raise 5,000 chickens.

The Vital Farms brand inspires loyalty normally reserved for companies like Apple or Nike. Maurice Sinnett, a retired newspaper pressman who lives on Whidbey Island, Washington, is a case in point. He and his wife used to buy Vital Farms eggs at a nearby Safeway. When it closed after a merger with rival chain Albertsons, Sinnett went looking there for Vital Farms. But Albertsons hadn't picked up the brand. So Sinnett started shopping at a local chain, Haggen. "It may seem crazy to change stores just for the eggs, but we think they are just that good," he said.

Sinnett likes the richer yolk. But mostly, he is motivated by the company's respect for animal welfare. "There's a humane way to do things and the 'I-don't-give-a-damn-I'm-at-the-top-of-the-food-chain way," he said, adding: "A woman recently asked me how could I pay $6 a dozen for eggs. My answer was, 'How much do you pay for a cup of coffee at Starbucks?'"
Muslim Brotherhood officials, who are supporting ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi, said security forces raided their encampment outside the Republican Guard compound with tear gas and gunfire about 4 a.m. Supporters of Morsi have camped there for days demanding the release of the former leader, who has been under arrest since a military coup last week.

The military's hand already is playing out on the streets, where being affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood now is considered all but an act of terrorism and much of the country is under a state of emergency and curfew.

The crackdown and other recent moves by the military are an effort to "obliterate the Brotherhood so it can shape the political environment rather than work within another one," Trager said.

In the weeks between July 3 and Wednesday, there were growing signs of a country increasingly under military control. More than 200 people, largely Morsi supporters, had died in clashes with security forces before Wednesday. Earlier this week, the government announced that it had named 25 provincial governors, 19 of whom were generals.

Upon announcing Morsi's ouster, Gen. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi named Adly Mansour as the president. Mansour went on to appoint a government largely of Hosni Mubarak-era holdovers and military generals.

Last month, weeks after Morsi supporters had erected their sit-in sites, el-Sissi, the minister of defense, gave an address urging Egyptians to take to the streets and give him a "mandate" to address the protesters. Millions did, then were frustrated when the sit-ins remained.

CAIRO — Hundreds of thousands of protesters swelled through villages and cities Sunday, denouncing Egypt's Islamist president and raising fears of a new revolution that could divide the nation, threaten its young democracy and unhinge its already-troubled economy.

Protesters against President Mohamed Morsi filled streets and squares, yelling "Leave, leave" on the first anniversary of his inauguration. The chants echoed against distant cheers of support from Islamists who held rival rallies in what has become a dangerously polarized nation.

Earlier studies of Einstein's brain found some regions, notably the prefrontal cortex and the parietal lobes, were just plain bigger than those of normal people. But, the authors wrote, "Our findings suggest that Einstein's extraordinary cognition was related not only to his unique cortical structure and cytoarchitectonics, but also involved enhanced communications routes between at least some parts of his two cerebral hemispheres."

That might reflect the fact that Einstein continued to exercise his brain strenuously, forestalling much of the atrophy that comes with age.

"In my mind, it's sort of a testament to how even an animal that's been studied for centuries may be doing amazing things that we were unaware of (until) we look closely," said study author Kenneth Catania, a neurobiologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.

### CON: Electric cars are running on empty promises

WASHINGTON — If government actually could mandate innovation, we could all fill up our cars with garden hoses.



But even Washington can't turn water into automotive fuel and that's why federal subsidies premised upon technological breakthroughs — such as those for electric cars — are a waste of money.

The second group of researchers, working with frozen zoo specimens, looked at more than 60 other species and found only elephants and wooly mammoths, their extinct relatives, had extra copies of the cancer-suppressing gene.

For about 30 years, international zoos have exchanged elephants in a largely unsuccessful breeding program. One of the few successful bull studs is the Pittsburgh Zoo's Jackson, who has sired offspring throughout the United States.

Even the most advanced submarine can't venture this deep.

First developed by the Navy, the boxy ROV may be the last best hope for unraveling the El Faro's fateful voyage and determining exactly why it sank last month, apparently within minutes of a final distress call, killing all 33 crew members.

Finding the recorder is critical because, in addition to navigation data, it contains audio that could let investigators, and families, hear what the crew said during the ship's last moments. Efforts to track its "pinger" signal across a 260-square-mile search area have so far failed.

There is also a possibility of recovering something that may bring some measure of comfort to families — bodies of the crew that went down with the ship.

"It's a strange world of reality that has hit these families," said John Moore, the Coral Gables attorney who is representing the families of two crew members. "They would like to have closure. I think recovering their loved ones is a step in that direction."

But the chances of that happening are remote. NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said investigators do not plan on trying to enter the vessel and search teams have not yet located the bridge of the ship, where the captain and a portion of the crew would have been stationed during the El Faro's battle with Category 4 Joaquin. Surveys of a large debris field have continued in hopes of locating that important part of the ship.

In his final message from the ship, Capt. Michael Davidson reported that the ship had lost propulsion and a hatch, or scuttle, had blown open, allowing water to enter one compartment. Davidson, who knew he was approaching a worsening hurricane and told his bosses at Tote Maritime Puerto Rico that he planned to sail 65 miles south of the storm, likely would have secured all the hatches.

"In this case, you have a crew that is well-trained judging from their maritime backgrounds and licensing. All evidence points to the ship itself as having deficiencies," said Gables attorney Moore, who plans to fight a ruling this week in Jacksonville federal court won by Tote to cap liability at about $15 million and set a December deadline for families to sue.

While the ship may have suffered some damage when it landed on the ocean floor, Moore said "a good forensic failure analysis expert" should be able to determine whether damage occurred from impact or on the surface as the listing ship drifted powerless within about 35 miles of Joaquin's eye.

"That effectively means all three were in contact with sea water at the same time," he said. "It's not like weather or rain. They're in the ocean at that point."

A fog of suffocating smoke settles over the Indonesian countryside, sickening hundreds of thousands of people and triggering an environmental crisis.

And in Ethiopia, crops perish for lack of seasonal rain as United Nations officials warn of imminent famine.

Periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean has occurred for thousands of years, but only recently have scientists come to appreciate its global reach, or even recognize its telltale signs.

Seasonal rains can fail to arrive in parts of India, Africa and Southeast Asia, killing crops and stoking wildfires. In parts of North and South America, a succession of pounding storms can roll over the landscape, as if delivered by an atmospheric conveyor belt.

In Southern California, El Nino is best known for traffic-halting downpours, overflowing rivers and debris flows. Yet El Nino's ability to steer rain away from agricultural fields has earned it the greatest infamy.

Climate change might have a nasty bite. A new study on snakebite rates in Costa Rica has found that the bite rate shoots up during El Nino — at both the hot and cold parts of the cycle — and that the problem disproportionately affects poor, rural populations.

Climate change isn't just about warming temperatures and rising sea levels. It also sets in motion complex consequences that may have unforeseen impacts on ecosystems and human health. Research shows that climate change alters patterns of disease transmission. But for this paper, the researchers wanted to focus on another affliction: snakebites.

SAN ISIDRO, El Salvador — Somewhere trapped in the earth below Francisco Pineda's feet are an estimated 1.4 million ounces of gold, and he wants the ore to remain there.

Today, Bryant's Grocery is derelict and forgotten, much like the town of Money. Although Till's lynching is considered a pivotal spark of the civil rights movement, there's little here to recall those events other than a modest historic marker erected outside Bryant's four years ago.

WASHINGTON — With a wide grin and a quick step, letter carrier Kenny Clark brings more than the day's mail to the people on his route in suburban Maryland.

"He's a neighborhood icon — him and his truck," said Amy Dick, who lives on Clark's route. But his future, and that of the U.S. Postal Service, is in doubt. The Postal Service lost $1.9 billion between January and March, and $15.9 billion last year. The 238-year-old institution loses $25 million each day, and has reached its borrowing limit with the federal Treasury. Daily mail delivery could be threatened within a year, officials say.

And at a recent hearing, the trio of Democratic senators — Durbin, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut — grilled executives from an industry they said was selling an unhealthy product and an unsafe message to young people.

The hearing was the most notable battle so far in the senators' latest campaign: to limit access by minors to the beverages. Energy drink companies contend the effort is misguided and overstates the health risk of caffeine to teenagers. But Durbin, Markey and Blumenthal are drawing upon their previous fights against the sale and advertising of cigarettes to children under age 18.

LONDON — A British scientist says he may have solved the mystery of the Abominable Snowman — the elusive ape-like creature of the Himalayas. He thinks it's a bear.

DNA analysis conducted by Oxford University genetics professor Bryan Sykes suggests the creature, also known as the Yeti, is the descendant of an ancient polar bear.

Sykes said Thursday that the tests showed the creatures were not related to modern Himalayan bears but were direct descendants of the prehistoric animal.

WASHINGTON — A growing language divide has opened up across the country, as a sharp increase in the number of Americans who speak English as a second language — or don't speak it at all — is driving cities and states to respond, often in radically different ways.

"This growing linguistic diversity, that is just simply a reality," said Patricia Gandara, a professor of education at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of a forthcoming book, "The Bilingual Advantage."

A group of experts in Britain and United States believes the illogical spelling in the English language is more than just annoying for those who have to memorize the rules. They propose an International English Spelling Congress to implement a spelling system that makes more sense.

LOS ANGELES — Nieves Garcia came from Mexico at age 6 and spent most of her elementary school years in California classified as an "English learner" even after she had picked up the language. Now a 32-year-old mother, she didn't want her daughter labeled the same way and subjected to additional testing.

And so she lied.

When Garcia signed up her daughter for kindergarten, she answered a standard four-question survey by saying her family spoke only English at home, even though her husband doesn't speak the language.

California plans to roll out a new English language proficiency test in 2016, and is considering changing its home language survey, said Elena Fajardo, administrator of the state Department of Education's language policy and leadership office. The survey was developed in 1980 and the state's population and immigration patterns have changed since then.

Census data shows that nearly 44 percent of Californians age 5 and older speak a language other than English. The most common language spoken is Spanish, and 57 percent of Spanish speakers in the state say they also speak English very well.

That's a marked shift from 1990, when less than a third of the state's residents age 5 and older spoke another language, and less than half of Spanish-speaking Californians claimed to also speak English very well, the data shows.

Most states including California — where nearly a quarter of public school students are considered English learners — screen children initially through the home language survey and give an English proficiency test to those whose families speak another language.

In California, more than 200,000 incoming kindergarteners were given the test in 2012 and only 9 percent were deemed English proficient, according to state data. Those results have led some parents to slam the use of a single day of testing of preschoolers — and an exam some say is too difficult — to determine a child's educational path.

"When we first found out about them in 2008, we thought we had a chance to nip this population in the bud," said the National Park Service's Tony Pernas, who co-chairs the Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area group. "Now we've changed from eradication mode to containment mode."

The chief worry among scientists and wildlife managers is the tegus fanning out to neighboring Everglades National Park (where a handful have been captured) as well as east to FPL's Turkey Point nuclear power plant and south to the Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge in north Key Largo. Containment is urgent, they say, because the lizards will eat just about anything — small mammals, birds, insects, plants, and their all-time favorite — eggs. That means goodbye to the baby American crocodiles that would have hatched in the refuge and the sand berms of the power plant — and recently were downlisted from an [endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species) to a threatened species. It could also mean lights out for the endangered Key Largo wood rat — not to mention other native creatures.

Asked whether he was concerned that the pets he sells may end up right back in the Everglades abandoned, Irwin responded that none of his customers are local and, in any case, they could buy a tegu in a pet store. He said he shares his capture data with the scientists working to contain the lizards' spread.

So far, there are no plans to include tegus with Burmese pythons for restrictions on ownership, according to Kristen Sommers, who heads the FWC's exotic species section. Instead, more study is in order.

"We need to figure out what's going on with this," Sommers said. "We're still in an information-gathering mode, trying to figure out what's the potential for spread and expansion and what would be the impact if that did happen. I hope within the next year we'll have enough data to determine our next steps."
The first match carries high drama. Defending champion Bomber and his partner, Mun Seong Won, or "MMA," will go up against veterans Chris "Huk" Loranger and "M.C.," whose real name is Jang Min Chul. M.C. came out of retirement for the tournament and is testing to see if he has lost his skills.

"The Coburg Hotel is a lovely hotel," he added. "But — way off the record — air conditioning is not what they did best."

With more and more days with higher temperatures, ICE trains have gotten a reputation as fast moving broilers. Windows don't open on high-speed trains.

At times, the issue is obvious to all. On Aug. 3, a high-speed train from Berlin to Munich was sitting in the Stuttgart station when one of its overworked air conditioning units burst into flames.

Trains are not the only place in Germany that could use an air conditioning upgrade. The temperature in the transparent cupola above the Bundestag, where the German parliament meets, has reached 104 many times this summer and has been recorded as high as 120. Around Berlin, its new nickname is "Hitzekuppel" or "heat dome" and tourists have passed out after making the climb to it. As such, it's often been closed during Berlin's peak tourist season — this week, for example — with officials noting they're "unsure when it will be open again."

This wasn't a remarkable occurrence in her life; she also rides in the warmth of summer, when Berlin's daylight lasts for almost 17 hours, and on most days in between. But it does make her a success story in a grand design in Berlin and cities throughout northern Europe to wean commuters off car travel and onto bikes. From her perspective, riding a bike is an easy choice.

Berlin's goal is to have 1 of every 5 trips within the city to be made by bike before 2025. To help in this effort, city law offers a tax break that's equivalent to 53 U.S. cents for every mile a cyclist commutes. Last year, the city invested $16 million in bike infrastructure.

Many of the youngsters are silent and traumatized when they arrive, but remarkably quickly, they begin to reclaim their equilibrium — or appear to. On a recent day at a center in Munich run by a group known as HPKJ, both the lunchroom and a game room were filled with boisterous chatter — some in German, some in the children's native languages, including Pashto, Arabic and Somali.

KATMANDU, Nepal — Litterbugs, beware: Nepal is making new rules to persuade trekkers to clean up after themselves on Mount Everest, in the hopes of clearing the tons of rubbish now clogging the world's highest peak.

Starting this spring, Nepali officials at Everest base camp will check that each climber descends the mountain with approximately 8 kilograms (18 pounds) of trash — the amount the government estimates an exhausted climber discards along the route.

However, the fee change irked environmentalists who said the mountain was already overburdened. Italian climbing legend Reinhold Messner has called for Nepal to close down Everest for a few years for the mountain to rest and recover.
KATMANDU, Nepal — The low boom, like thunder, didn't startle Galden Sherpa at first. At Mount Everest base camp, climbers often heard the loud rumble of ice fracturing as the first sunlight struck the mountainside above.

Babies, for example, need regular movement to carve out critical pathways and form connections in the brain. In children, research suggests exercise improves attention, focus and academic performance. And in the elderly, exercise has been shown to help stave off memory loss associated with some forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.

"Physical activity is crucial to mind and body alike," said neuroscientist Lise Eliot, who writes about the benefits of movement on the brain in her book "Pink Brain, Blue Brain." "The brain benefits as much as the heart and other muscles from physical activity."

"We've found exercise has broad benefits on cognition, particularly executive functioning, including improvements in attention, working memory and the ability to multitask," said researcher Charles Hillman, a professor of kinesiology and community health at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In fact, an active lifestyle during childhood may confer protective effects on brain health across the life span, Hillman said.

Over the last two decades, researchers have learned that exercise acts on multiple levels in the brain. The brain's wiring depends on the integrity of the brain cells or neurons, as well as the connections between the neurons, or the synapses.

LODI, N.J. — Pet store owner Joe Averso has found a niche in downtown Lodi that he believes will set him apart from the big-box pet store competition.

Averso also has what he described as a "super rare" striped possum, a larger South Pacific marsupial, about the size of a gray squirrel with black and white stripes, priced at $2,500. These he also he gets from his Florida breeder.

Earlier this year, he received a hard-to-get license from the state Division of Fish and Wildlife to sell captive-bred skunks, a native North American species. "We've already sold 35 of them," he said. The price ranges from $650 to $950, depending on color and markings.

It is illegal to keep a skunk in New Jersey unless it is acquired from a licensed dealer, and Averso is the only dealer in the state authorized to sell them, said Susan Predl, chief biologist at the Division of Fish and Wildlife. As such, he can issue a temporary permit to skunk buyers, who must then pay $12 a year for a captive-game permit.

NJ Exotic Pets works closely with veterinarian Christopher Stancel of the Dog, Cat &amp; Bird Clinic of Nutley, N.J., an exotic-pets specialist, who de-scents and neuters the baby skunks before they are sold, Averso said.

"Is there high demand for pet skunks? No," said Joe Ricciuti, owner of 88 Pet World in Brick, New Jersey, who stopped selling them a number of years ago. "Are there people out there who want them? Yes," Ricciuti said.

And because they do, store manager Megan Zayatz, 29, has the unenviable task of cleaning the skunk cages.

WASHINGTON — This summer, Milwaukee residents were captivated by reports of what appeared to be a lionlike creature roaming city neighborhoods. Authorities set up a dragnet and traps, but the big cat was never located.

Wanggaard wants his state to join dozens of others that have passed laws banning or regulating big cats, bears, apes and other exotic pets, which animal welfare advocates say can threaten public safety when they escape and are at risk of being poorly cared for by private owners. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20151001_EXOTIC_PETS_1.png" />

But bills restricting or regulating exotic animal ownership often die in state legislatures. This year, six measures failed — in Indiana, Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia and Wyoming — according to Born Free.

"In some of these states, it's very hard to have a conversation about it," said Born Free's Dylewsky.

"You almost feel like Santa Claus with a sled pulling in. I've got all kinds of goodies in the back of my plane," Rork said from his home in Jackson Hole, Wyo.

"We have so many here that it tends to be overwhelming for people," said Melissa Gable, public information officer at the Maricopa County Animal Care and Control. "Sending them some place where they might not have as many Chihuahuas certainly means they'll get adopted a lot quicker than they would if they stayed here."

"My buddy had just handed me a cup of coffee in the morning and we're watching 'Good Morning America,' " Wills said. "And there's the Exxon Valdez on TV, spilling oil."

"We were like, 'No!' It was just the start of a nightmare," Wills said.

The herring of Prince William Sound still have not recovered. Neither have killer whales, and legal issues remain unresolved a quarter of a century later. Monday was the 25th anniversary of the disaster, in which the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef and spilled at least 11 million gallons of oil into the pristine waters of the sound.

One of the groups continues its slow recovery. The other numbered 22 killer whales at the time of the spill and is down to just seven. Scientists now expect it to go extinct, the end of a genetic line that researchers say has hunted in the area for thousands of years, maybe since the last Ice Age.

WASHINGTON — After nearly a decade of being derided as dangerous to fly and an example of wasteful military spending, the radar-evading F-22 Raptor fighter jet flew in combat for the first time in this week's U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria.

Lieutenant General William Mayville, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the aircraft helped drop GPS-guided bombs on an array of targets, including militants' headquarters, training camps, barracks and combat vehicles.

The plane can hit supersonic speeds without using afterburners, enabling it to fly faster and farther. It carries cutting-edge radar and sensors, supposedly enabling a pilot to track and shoot an enemy aircraft before that craft can detect the F-22.

The eight-story Rana Plaza factory complex crumbled on April 24 with nearly 3,000 workers trapped inside, killing more than 1,100. It is the garment industry's worst-ever accident and reports amid the debris have been dramatic.

Starting three years ago, the central Washington state grower hired Vahe Alaverdian of Falcon Force (http://falconforce.com), a master falconer based in La Crescenta, Calif., to drive out the flocks of sparrows and starlings that were fattened off Flamm's fields.

Alex Weiser, a specialty fruit and vegetable grower in Kern and San Bernardino counties, has an employee drive up and down his fields shooing away the birds like a come-to-life scarecrow.

"It's hard, really hard to get everyone going in the morning," said their father, Jonathan Kelly, 53. "We try to pair them with someone who motivates them."

A single day of catching bugs and completing scavenger hunts as part of Missouri State Parks' Learn2 Camp program wasn't enough for nature's newly initiated. They wanted another night to roast marshmallows and belt out "I've Been Workin' On The Railroad" around a campfire, and soon.

That's exactly what Missouri State Parks wants to hear.

Camping permit sales in Missouri's parks dropped 13 percent between 2000 and 2013, the most recent year for which camping statistics were available. National parks have been weathering a decline in overnight stays since the 1980s as visitors have opted for the comfort of nearby motels.

This year's Learn2 Camp last weekend at Weston Bend provided the perfect test run.

With the help of park employees, Ron Minter figured out how to put up the massive six-person tent that had been gathering dust in the garage. Isaac and Tessa learned how to identify various trees, insects and animal tracks. Kelly Minter is hoping instructions on using kindling to start a campfire will replace Ron's penchant for lighter fluid and starter logs.

"I think we might be camping more," Kelly Minter said with a laugh.

National parks hosted nearly 11.9 million overnight visits in 1981, according to the National Park Service. That number had shrunk to 8.8 million by 2000, a 26 percent difference.

Visitors now have more overnight options, including staying in nearby towns.

"We've seen a great change in what a gateway community looks like in the last 30 years or so," Olson said. "They have a lot more in the way of services for visitors, like motel rooms and seats in restaurants. Some people love to spend the night near national parks and then get up and go after breakfast in the morning."

But the Learn2 Camp program does try to take advantage of one favorable statistic.

NEWARK, Del. — When a team of researchers from the University of Delaware traveled to Africa two years ago to search for exemplary chickens, they weren't looking for plump thighs or delicious eggs.

They were seeking out birds that could survive a hotter planet.

The researchers were in the vanguard of food scientists, backed by millions of dollars from the federal government, racing to develop new breeds of farm animals that can stand up to the hazards of [global warming](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

Some climate change activists dismiss the work, which is just getting under way, as a distraction and a concession to industrial-style agriculture, which they blame for compounding the world's environmental problems. Those leading the experiments, however, say new, heat-resistant breeds of farm animals will be essential to feeding the world as climate change takes hold.

WASHINGTON — Walk the aisles of any neighborhood grocery store today and you're as likely to find tomatoes picked in Sinaloa, Mexico, as Central California or oranges from Sao Paulo, Brazil, as Bradenton, Florida.

Farmers across the country warn that shoppers will find even more imported food on their store shelves if Congress fails to pass immigration legislation that would guarantee them enough workers to milk their cows and harvest their fruits and vegetables.

A bipartisan proposal in the Senate that would create a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally would allow quicker legalization for agriculture workers.

Charles Conner, president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, a trade group, said the country can't continue to produce food in the quantities it produces without its foreign-born workers.

"If that labor was not available to us," Conner said, "...it would mean that we would get that food from somewhere else beyond the borders of the United States. And that's just crazy to think that we would allow that to happen."

Citing a 2008 study by Texas A&amp;M University, he said some 80,000 acres of fresh fruit and vegetable production in California alone has been moved overseas because of labor shortages, a trend counter to the desires of Americans who want more and more information about the food they eat and who want it locally grown.

The move has raised concerns about privacy and government surveillance, leading to drone privacy bills being introduced in most states this year and about a dozen states passing laws, most to limit drone surveillance by law enforcement.

Those concerns, in turn, have tempered interest in developing unmanned aircraft technology for police and other crime-fighting agencies — leading drone manufacturers and researchers to focus on agriculture instead, said Josh Brungardt, director of unmanned systems at PARADIGM, a Bend, Oregon-based drone research company.

University of Oregon researchers flew drones this summer over potato fields to monitor for disease. Oregon nurseries have also partnered with researchers to test unmanned technology to count potted trees.

In Florida, farmers and researchers have used small unmanned helicopters equipped with infrared cameras to monitor orange trees for the deadly citrus greening, a bacterial disease that kills the trees. Greening begins at the top of the tree.

Some farmers fear environmental groups could use the technology to spy on them — PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, recently announced plans to purchase drones to monitor factory farms.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — If farmers can't change the weather — or a seesawing climate — perhaps data-crunchers can outwit Mother Nature.

While agriculture is resilient to climate change in the near term, the report cautioned that changing environmental conditions pose "unprecedented challenges" in the long run.

Everything in this fertile agricultural region 200 miles south of San Diego has changed, it seemed, except her wages. Zaragoza said she still earns 110 pesos per day, about $8 — a little more than when she started picking as a 13-year-old.

Pickers not only stayed out of the fields, they stood shoulder to shoulder blocking the main highway, stalling traffic for hours and all but stopping the harvest at the height of the season.

Baseball games consistently have increased in length in the past few decades. The time of an average game has increased from 2 hours, 23 minutes in 1950 to 2:33 in 1981 to more than three hours this season. The first three games of the World Series took 3:32, 3:25 and 3:15. According to Nielsen Media Research, Game 1 television ratings set a record low for the second time in three seasons and declined as the game went on, though that corresponded with a growing San Francisco Giants lead.

More troublesome than the length of games is the slower pace of play. Since teams averaged 5.14 runs per game in 2000, which came at the height of the steroid era and was the highest total in the live-ball era since 1936, scoring has declined, settling at 4.07 runs per game this year. Strikeouts steadily have increased for the entire previous century and especially in the past 10 seasons.

The PITCHf/x system that tracks pitch velocity and movement in every ballpark puts a time stamp on each pitch thrown, allowing for calculation of a "pace" for each pitcher or hitter representing the average time between pitches during their plate appearances. Some pitchers, such as Mark Buehrle of the Toronto Blue Jays and Doug Fister of the Washington Nationals, motor along, averaging around 18 seconds between pitches — the quickest pace among qualified starters this year. Others take longer: Edinson Volquez of the Pirates, for example, averaged 25.3 seconds between pitches, the fourth-slowest time this year.

The rules are enforced at Salt River Fields, the only AFL ballpark outfitted with the clocks. Five digital clocks — two in each dugout, two behind home plate and one on the wall in left-center field — counted down the various times. The mere presence of the clocks altered play, Bell said: The clocks behind home plate, offset so as not to distract the pitcher, lined up with the first and third basemen's view of the strike zone.

"So you're looking at 20, 19, you're trying to pick up the ball, the lights are flashing right behind," he said. "It's definitely a little bit different."

"I feel so happy," Bailey's daughter, Taniya, said after they stopped moving. "I feel pretty."

RIO DE JANEIRO — On a recent visit to the future site of Olympic Park, Brazil President Dilma Rousseff promised the 2016 Summer Games in Rio would be "the Olympics of all Olympics," echoing a refrain she used during the chaotic lead-up to the World Cup.

After a last-minute scramble to organize the World Cup, the event went more smoothly than anticipated — but not for favela residents.

Brazilian officials started evicting residents by force and simultaneously demolishing this decades-old favela prior to the World Cup, purportedly as part of the massive infrastructure upgrade required by the global soccer tournament and the Olympics, planned for August 2016.

WASHINGTON — FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III testified Wednesday that the controversial National Security Agency surveillance program "has been a contributing factor, one dot among many dots" for tracking terrorist plots, and he admitted for the first time that the bureau had used surveillance drones inside the U.S.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California, asked Mueller to detail what protections the FBI had put in place to limit how video and other information collected by drones was used by federal investigators. She called drones "the greatest threat to the privacy of Americans."

CHICAGO — The Food and Drug Administration moved Thursday to virtually eliminate trans fat, an artificially created artery-clogging substance, from Americans' diets.

Americans' consumption of trans fats has declined almost 80 percent in the last decade, thanks to broader education about their risks, voluntary reduction by food manufacturers and restaurants and some local bans, like New York City's in 2007.

How people prepare foods at home also has an impact on trans fat content. For instance, the nutrition label on a box of Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese lists zero grams trans fat per serving. But additional information included on the label notes that preparing the dish by adding margarine and 2 percent reduced fat milk adds 4 grams of trans fat per serving.

Kraft declined comment, saying it wasn't prepared to discuss the issue. Mondelez International, which makes snacks under dozens of brand names including Oreo cookies, Wheat Thins, Triscuits, Fig Newtons and Nilla Wafers, said all of its cookies and crackers are labeled as "zero grams trans fat" per serving.

But some Mondelez products, like Ritz crackers, still contain partially hydrogenated oil, according to the label.

At that cost, the government would make money on the switch only if $1 bills lasted less than 4.75 years. With a current shelf life of 70 months, or about 5.8 years, the $1 bill is more efficient, the Fed said.

The following three women engineers are making their mark on today's cars while setting the groundwork for the next generation of young women interested in automotive science and technology.

And its goal, said Director Grande H. Lum in an interview last week with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, isn't to make arrests or file lawsuits, but to give all sides a private place to talk, and, hopefully, solve their own problems.

FERGUSON, Mo. — For the first time in Ferguson's 120-year history, the City Council will have three black members, but even so, Tuesday's election was less than a clear victory for the throngs of volunteers who poured into the city in a last-minute push to sway voters.

Hudgins, a self-identified protester and independent journalist, who ran in the 2nd Ward, lost to former Mayor Brian Fletcher, founder of the "I love Ferguson" campaign.

FERGUSON, Mo. — In an unusual declaration for an American city, Governor Jay Nixon imposed a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew Saturday after fresh violence erupted here amid public anger over the shooting death of an unarmed black man by a white police officer.

The governor's curfew and state of emergency decree underscored the gravity of the situation in Ferguson, where officials have been unable to calm tempers and racial tensions since the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by police Officer Darren Wilson.

At a chaotic news conference where Nixon was shouted down at times by residents demanding that charges be filed against Wilson, the Democratic governor said the only way to restore peace was to ensure safety on the streets.

FERGUSON, Mo. — A grand jury has decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown, the unarmed, black 18-year-old whose fatal shooting sparked weeks of sometimes violent protests and exposed deep racial tension between many black Americans and police.

ST. LOUIS — From street-artist paintings on boards protecting store windows to signs bearing the now iconic statement, "Hands Up. Don't Shoot," cultural images from the Ferguson protests have become firmly established in recent Missouri history. So much so that the Missouri History Museum is gathering images and items cataloging the unrest that followed the August shooting death of Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer.

Aside from its regular exhibits, the expansive museum offers a public library housing an array of documents, relics and written words from events dating back more than 200 years, including the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the Louisiana Purchase.

In a statement, Nixon said the National Guard would help "in restoring peace and order" to the St. Louis suburb that has been filled almost nightly with angry, defiant crowds since 18-year-old Michael Brown was killed Aug. 9 by a white police officer.

As night fell in Ferguson, another peaceful protest quickly deteriorated after marchers pushed toward one end of a street and authorities — who said they were responding to reports of gunfire, looting, vandalism and protesters who hurled Molotov cocktails — pushed them back by repeatedly firing tear gas. The streets were empty well before a state-imposed curfew took effect at midnight.

Officer Darren Wilson's shooting of Brown after a struggle in the street was only the first chapter of a saga with no end in sight.

A year later, Brown's death and the ensuing protests that engulfed the predominantly black St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Missouri, have changed hundreds of lives and unleashed a national debate on race and policing that continues to dominate headlines today, while Ferguson quietly struggles forward.

"Things have changed, a lot," said David Whitt, a 35-year-old father of three who lives in an apartment complex near where Brown was killed. But, Whitt said, "the issue still remains that somebody was killed by police, and people say, 'We haven't got justice.'"

It hasn't been so easy this year. Unrest after Michael Brown's death in Ferguson forced cancellations of practices. The team lost some funding. There are difficulties raising more money.

"There are good kids out there and good parents," Wesley-Stewart said.

At first Daniels paid for most of the food out of her pocket, but as the weeks wore on she has accepted donations from the dozens of activists she feeds each week.

Daniels says her passion is cake design, but she serves up Southern-style comfort food on Sundays. Police officers have yet to walk across the street for a meal, Daniels said, but if anyone with a badge and gun joins the buffet line she'll gladly fix them a plate.

Crump told reporters he wanted to thank police "in advance" for "not having a repeat of the horrific encounters that took place in August," saying that police sometimes went too far and violated the rights of peaceful protesters and the media.

Crump criticized the grand jury's secrecy and insisted that Wilson should have been charged by prosecutors long ago.

MIAMI — Somewhere in the southern reaches of Miami-Dade County, the only fern of its kind known to grow wild in the continental U.S. survives under a thicket of Brazilian pepper.

Botanists have long worried that the fern — discovered in 2006 near Florida City in a location they prefer not to disclose — could be just one hurricane, plant poacher or misfired shot of herbicide away from disappearing forever. So two years ago a team led by Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden launched a rescue mission, ultimately more drudging than gripping, to collect and propagate spores no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence.

As millions of Filipinos desperately search for sustenance and shelter in the devastation left by Typhoon Haiyan, many may be comforted by the knowledge that help is surely on the way from family members working abroad.

For more than 30 years, the Philippines' legions of jobless and underemployed have been encouraged to seek their fortunes elsewhere, as a succession of leaders since the late Ferdinand Marcos have failed to develop an economy capable of providing enough jobs.

Now, as in the aftermath of other natural disasters, that global workforce is at the forefront of relief efforts and galvanizing the largess of the foreign populations they serve.

About a third of the 10.5 million Filipinos living abroad are in the United States, according to Philippine government figures. That has provided a committed force to raise funds for typhoon victims, over and above the money Filipino emigres and overseas workers send home on a regular basis, said Albert Santoli, a Philippine native who founded the Asia America Initiative. The organization provides development assistance and emergency relief to the Philippines.

The Alaska Legislature on April 19 approved a bill to kill the state's film tax credit program, which was scheduled to expire at the end of 2018, in 2016. Independent Gov. Bill Walker also called for a halt to new credits.

But other states are doubling down on their film tax incentives.

California, worried about the incentives other states are using to lure Hollywood productions, last year tripled to $330 million the amount available for film tax breaks.

Carson also got ahead of himself on Sunday, confirming his plans to run in an interview that aired on an Ohio television station.

"I'm willing to be part of the equation and, therefore, I'm announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America," he told WKRC-TV in Cincinnati.

Carson, 63, made his formal announcement Monday in a speech from his native Detroit shortly after having breakfast at a local museum of African-American history.

Both candidates begin the race as underdogs in a campaign expected to feature several seasoned politicians, among them former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Yet while they have claimed much of the early attention and favor from donors, the GOP race is a wide-open contest that could ultimately feature as many as two dozen major candidates.

NORTHAMPTON, Mass. — Audrey Olmos-Govea sat in her first sociology class at Smith College and couldn't believe what she had just heard. As she remembers it, a guest lecturer turned to the class and said: "You understand, you've all been to Europe, right?"

The lecturer turned beet red and apologized. Olmos-Govea felt embarrassed. "I thought, what have I done?" she recalled recently. "I've just isolated myself in this small group of people. But after the fact, I knew it was the right thing to do."

"There has been a trend away from the traditional museum approach, in which the first lady is treated in a separate, boxy space filled with dresses and perhaps some images from her travels and state dinners," said Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar who has served as director of several presidential libraries. "As an alternative, her story is being more fully integrated with that of her spouse — just like in real life."

She was joined at the White House by a panel that included women of the civil rights movement including two who broke down barriers to attend school: Charlayne Hunter-Gault, one of the first to desegregate the University of Georgia, and Carlotta Walls LaNier, the youngest member of the Little Rock Nine, the group of black high school students barred from entering Arkansas' racially segregated Little Rock Central High School.

SEATTLE — A tiny white sliver inside the heads of fish could hold evidence of a century's worth of humans wrecking the environment: atomic bombs, overfishing, even climate change.

Fish ear bones, also known as otoliths, are like tree rings for the ocean. A layer of calcium carbonate laid down each year offers a snapshot of both the fish's yearly growth and its surrounding ocean conditions.

The University of Washington's Burke Museum has been transferring and cataloging 2 million pairs of otoliths, representing some 80 species. Scientists hope this collection, gathered over the past half-century, will help them track the health of fish populations and ocean conditions up and down the West Coast.

The reason for the not-so-big move? Fire. Although NOAA scientists had been doing active research on the collection, the thousands of flammable Styrofoam boxes — piled 20 feet high and filled with ethanol for preservation — were a huge fire hazard.

The threat of fire persuaded the National Science Foundation to fund a two-year, $500,000 grant. Instead of sitting haphazardly and uncataloged in a hangar, the otoliths will be archived in the Burke and searchable online for outside scientists.

The UW recently made the first loan of the otoliths to Oregon State University, where researchers are studying the age when flatfish settle to the ocean floor.

Information unlocked by analyzing the chemical makeup of each otolith layer has piqued the interest of archaeologists, geochemists and fish biologists alike.

Fishermen, not scientists, were the original beneficiaries of the otolith data, which feed population models that help determine catch limits each year. Fish populations are closely managed by NOAA so as not to repeat disasters such as cod overfishing on the East Coast. Otoliths reveal age, which when aggregated with the sex, size and locations of capture for many fish, paint a portrait of the population's health. Thus, scientists can estimate how much fishermen can catch without causing a whole species collapse.

Trained observers go to sea with fishermen to gather catch and bycatch data. NOAA's fishery research centers rely on scientific survey boats as well as these observers to collect otoliths.

Jeremy Harris, a graduate student working with the otolith collection at the UW, is also leading a project that could uncover the effects of [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

Combining growth data with temperature could also shed light on climate change. On a longer time scale, 4,000-year old otoliths in prehistoric trash heaps are a record of ancient surface-water temperatures. This is the basis of a collaboration between Helser and archeologists in Newfoundland.

There are plenty of fish in the sea. Plenty, also, in the trash.

Of all the food that Americans waste - and Americans waste a lot of food - it's the seafood that never gets eaten that should trouble us most. Few sources of nutrition, after all, are as coveted as fish. They're high in protein and low in fat. Eating them is associated with all sorts of beneficial health outcomes. And yet, few foods are discarded so frequently.

Between 2009 and 2013, as much as 47 percent of all edible seafood in the United States went to waste, according to a new study from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. The majority of that is due to consumers (both families and food businesses), who buy fresh and frozen fish, but never end up eating it or selling it.

Jordan, 37, was spotted and rescued Thursday afternoon from his crippled boat, a 35-foot fishing vessel named Angel, about 200 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, the U.S. Coast Guard said. He was airlifted to a hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, Thursday evening with a shoulder injury and dehydration, but refused treatment and left with his parents around 2 a.m. Friday, the Coast Guard and a hospital spokesman said.

"I was flying through the air, somersaulting, and everything was upside down and backwards," he told NBC News on Friday.

Coast Guard spokeswoman Lieutenant Krystyn Pecora said Jordan got caught in some rough weather, and his boat's mast was broken and its electronics damaged. According to Jordan's family, he capsized at least twice more.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — William Howard Taft, the heaviest president in U.S. history, grew so tired of being ridiculed about his weight that he told his physician to put him on a diet, noting that "no real gentleman weighs more than 300 pounds."

Governor Chris Christie, once an estimated 200 pounds overweight, appears to have taken off at least half those excess pounds in the 21 months since he had Lap-Band surgery, according to experts, a victory many see as essential if the New Jersey Republican intends to make a 2016 bid for the White House.

Biology students at Aston University in Birmingham, England, tested the time-honored five-second rule and claim to have found some truth to it. The faster you pick food up off the floor, they discovered, the less likely it is to contain bacteria.

"I would be very skeptically cautious about the results, and even more about the interpretation," he said.

Henry Lund was beat after a long day as a flight attendant when he arrived at his Anchorage, Alaska, hotel desperate to sleep before a 4 a.m. wake-up call for the trip back to Minneapolis-St. Paul. He remembers taking a sleeping pill — maybe two.

The return trip last summer would end his long career at Delta and Northwest airlines.

His experience illustrates a broader problem for the nation's flight attendants. While they share responsibility with pilots for passenger safety, they work with less rest than foreign flight attendants and can rely more on sleeping pills than pilots do.

Flight attendants exhausted from long hours and little rest have forgotten to engage or disarm emergency chutes, failed to properly stow baggage and carry out other safety duties. The federal government says the risk of mishaps may have increased as airlines cut rest periods to save money.

There has been plenty of concern about tired pilots. The FAA in 2011 toughened its rules for pilot rest after safety investigators determined that pilots in the crash of Colgan Air Flight 3407 in upstate New York were likely impaired by fatigue.

The FAA set a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots prior to duty, effective next January.

"Why would we not want to keep fatigue managed to the same degree?" asked John Cox, a longtime airline pilot and CEO of Safety Operating Systems, an aviation safety consultancy. "The stresses are different, but the days are equally long or longer."

Surveys show that uncomfortable seats and shrinking legroom have become the top gripes of travelers, surpassing ticket prices and security lines.

"The airlines have been so focused on the bottom line that they don't realize you can't balance your budget on the back of passengers," said Alex Gerwer, a frequent business traveler from Long Beach, California.

FLINT, Mich. — Ariana Hawk heated a bowl of distilled water in the microwave, dipped a washcloth in it and wiped her 2-year-old son's itchy, irritated skin.

Residents across Flint — some of whom stopped using the water immediately after the cost-saving change because of its smell, color, taste and source and others who continued to drink and cook with it — echo her frustration.

People, pets, even plants have been affected by the poisonous, lead-contaminated water, they said.

Community members feel betrayed, worried, angry, sad and stressed and are bracing for what will happen next in Flint, a city with 99,000 residents, 40 percent of whom live in poverty.

"We were drinking it regularly," said Battle, 36\. "The whole family. Everyone here."

ENGLEWOOD, N.J. — Gerald Marion has spent his career fighting fires, not racial injustice. The lifelong Englewood resident rose through the ranks and became the city's second black fire chief, earning a reputation as a calm, steadfast advocate for his department who stayed out of the political fray.

To help restore damaged reefs, scientists at the National Coral Reef Institute in Dania Beach are growing baby corals in indoor nurseries and transplanting them offshore. Similar transplants are replenishing reefs along the Florida Keys.

"There's no doubt that if we destroy those beautiful reefs, there will be some significant economic impact," said Abraham Pizam, director of the Institute for Tourism Studies at the University of Central Florida. "It's not the magnitude of those man-made attractions that we have in Florida. But nevertheless, it's an important element that should be preserved for generations to come."

The decision was a victory, but a small one in the bigger war to save the honeybee. Over the past decade, disease, extreme weather, loss of foraging grounds, an invasion of Africanized bees and even bad publicity have created peril for honeybees. About 30 percent of the nation's bees are dying every year, nearly double historic numbers, although last year the decline slowed slightly, beekeepers say.

PHILADELPHIA — For the poor, food is not only scarce, it's often rotten and germ-ridden.

Corner stores and small supermarkets that feed vast swaths of impoverished Philadelphia offer bacteria-laced foods in unhealthy conditions that can lead to foodborne illness, a Drexel University study shows.

"Potatoes and baby food are moldy, lettuce is rotten, and the mice are having a good time in boxes of noodles," said Rodney Jenkins, 47, an unemployed North Philadelphia man. "I ate bad fruit from a corner store and got sick."

A father of seven who was laid off last fall from a sound company that provides microphones and other equipment for events, Jenkins worries about feeding his children with so few worthwhile food choices.

The only research of its kind in the United States, according to microbiologists, the study of retail food safety risks is being conducted by Jennifer Quinlan, a food microbiologist in the department of nutrition sciences at Drexel's College of Nursing and Health Professions.

She and her team visited nearly 400 corner stores and small supermarkets between 2008 and 2010 to study microbes in milk, eggs, lunch meat, sandwiches and ready-to-eat fresh fruits and greens.

Each year foodborne illnesses caused by these microorganisms sicken 48 million Americans, hospitalize 128,000 and kill 3,000, according to the agency.

Food fraud is also increasing. In 2014, Oceana, an international conservation organization, published a two-year study of 1,215 seafood samples and 46 fish types from 674 retailers in 21 states. They found that a third of samples were mislabeled.

WASHINGTON — The government shutdown has slowed or halted federal efforts to protect Americans' health and safety, from probes into the cause of transportation and workplace accidents to tracking foodborne illness. The latest example: an outbreak of salmonella in chicken that has sickened people in 18 states.

The Food and Drug Administration also has stopped routine inspections of food facilities in the United States and abroad, and border controls could be delayed. Food imports are still being inspected at borders, but any samples that need to be analyzed could be stalled because there are fewer scientists to analyze them.

She noted that the CDC website has limited information and the USDA website is shut down, preventing concerned members of the public from finding out more information on the salmonella outbreak and other foodborne illnesses. The agencies aren't tweeting or disseminating health safety information except for a few releases to the media.

What a drag it is, eating kale that is not as crisp as it was when first plucked from the ground. Squash that's a few days old, too — it isn't bad, but it could be better. It could be 1 day old. Or not old.

A new study, published this week by a team of researchers at Johns Hopkins University, found that Americans are pretty picky about what gets to stay in their refrigerators. One of the most common excuses for tossing out food is that people "want to eat only the freshest food." The other widely cited reason is a fear of food poisoning.

But caring too much about how green an avocado is or how many days it has been since a peach was first picked by a farmer can also be a very bad thing, especially when it encourages people to throw out perfectly edible things because they are not fresh enough by their newly found standards.

## Tons Of Food Gone To Waste

The amount of food that goes to waste in the United States has ballooned in recent years. In 2012, the nearest year for which estimates are available, Americans threw out about 35 million tons of food, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. That is almost 20 percent more food than Americans tossed out in 2000.

This most recent research confirms that food poisoning is indeed on many people's minds. But it also suggests that food snobbery is not helping either. There are legitimate reasons, after all, to throw away food. "I am above this less-than-ideal apple," however, isn't one of them.
For hundreds of years, scientists have known about four basic tastes: sour, sweet, salty and bitter. More recently, a Japanese chemist discovered a fifth basic taste, umami, which is triggered by monosodium glutamate, or MSG, as it's more widely known. Umami, perhaps best described as savory, is especially prevalent in truffles, meat and anchovies.

And now, scientists believe they have found a sixth basic taste that could profoundly change the way we eat.

## The Sixth Taste

And so it goes on hundreds of campuses in Los Angeles Unified, the nation's second-largest school system, which serves 650,000 meals a day. Students throw out at least $100,000 worth of food a day — and probably far more, according to estimates by David Binkle, the district's food services director. That amounts to $18 million a year — based on a conservative estimate of 10 percent food waste — which Binkle says would be far better spent on higher-quality items, such as strawberries or watermelons.

LA Unified, regarded as a national leader in making school food more healthful, has taken many of these steps. Celebrity chefs, such as Jamie Oliver, have helped develop menus. More than 270 schools offer "harvest of the month" lessons about produce, and 450 schools have started campus gardens.

Still the food piles up in school trash cans.

Back at Washington Prep, a few students said they ate their entire lunches. Daniel Ofa, a hulking sophomore, said he doesn't really enjoy the spaghetti or enchiladas but downs them anyway.

### PRO: Most Americans believe GMO foods are unsafe; they need labels to avoid them

Polls indicate alarm over the contamination of everyday foods by pesticides, antibiotics, hormones, synthetic additives and, especially, genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

Indeed, Americans now spend more than 10 cents of every food dollar for items that are labeled "organic," "non-GMO" or "natural."

In the U.S., the glyphosate herbicide currently is sprayed heavily on 84 percent of all GMO crops, including corn, soybeans, canola, sugar beets, cotton, alfalfa, wheat, beans and rice.

WASHINGTON — Doctors are warning that if Congress cuts food stamps, the federal government could be socked with bigger health bills. Maybe not immediately, they say, but over time if the poor wind up in doctors' offices or hospitals as a result.

She is working on a project with Feeding America, a network of food banks, to try to improve health by providing extra, diabetes-appropriate foods, including fresh produce and whole-grain cereals and pastas, for diabetics at a few food banks in California, Texas and Ohio.

"Food is medicine," says Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, who has led the Democrats' defense of the food stamp program. "Critics focus almost exclusively on how much we spend, and I wish they understood that if we did this better, we could save a lot more money in health care costs."

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/food-6e6e972a-9c79-11e5-a3c5-c77f2cc5a43c.jpg"/>One of the most profound contradictions of modern America is that more than 45 million Americans don't have enough to eat, but the country wastes an estimated 40 percent of its food.

Belding, then a volunteer at a local food pantry in Pella, had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese in front of numerous people lining up outside to collect food.

"We were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate," Belding, then a freshman in high school, remembers venting that day. That frustration would ultimately lead the American University sophomore to develop a groundbreaking innovation in the long - and often inefficient - war on hunger.

After years of research, Belding, 20, has founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing them to quickly share surplus food that might have otherwise gone to waste. Pantries simply post their excess food to the program - and someone else in the network picks it up and puts it to use. So far, the database has saved an estimated two tons of food.

The troubled, troubling relationship between the two offensive linemen took an ominous turn Monday with fresh revelations: Incognito sent text messages to his teammate that were racist and threatening, two people familiar with the situation said.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the Dolphins and NFL haven't disclosed the nature of the misconduct that led to Sunday's suspension of Incognito, a veteran with a reputation for dirty play.

Martin, a tackle, remained absent from practice Monday one week after he suddenly left the team because of emotional issues. Also missing was Incognito, a guard suspended indefinitely late Sunday by coach Joe Philbin for his treatment of Martin.

The team and NFL continued their investigation into allegations by Martin's representatives that he was [bullied](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying), and Philbin said Dolphins owner Stephen Ross asked Commissioner Roger Goodell for assistance. The NFL Players Association also planned to look into the matter.

Incognito, who's in the final year of a $13 million, three-year contract, has long had a reputation of being among the NFL's dirtiest players. During his first four years, he led the league in penalties for unnecessary roughness, and the St. Louis Rams got fed up with his undisciplined play and released him during the 2009 season.

"There's certain people out there who are just punks, and he wants to be that kind of guy," former Seahawks and Lions defensive end Lawrence Jackson said Monday. "But because he's a lineman, he gets away with a lot of stuff that people don't see. ... Incognito is way worse than anybody I ever played against."

Last year he was voted by the league's players into the Pro Bowl for the first time. He was the co-winner of the Dolphins' Good Guy Award, given to the team's most cooperative player by the local media. He also won frequent praise from Dolphins coaches for his leadership, and this year he was voted by teammates to serve as a member of the Dolphins' player council.

"It gets rid of those little small hits you get in practice that kind of turn your eyes green a little bit," said defensive end Nick Spracklen, 20. "It keeps your head fresh, keeps those headaches away. You leave practice without a headache, your whole day is better."

Three weeks after receiving a kidney transplant from his brother, a former Ravens' player, Chris Kemoeatu has heard all of the wisecracks.

"There were days when I drove him (from their Canton townhouse) to dialysis when Chris looked at me and said, 'I don't think I can do this anymore,'" Ma'ake recalled. "I said, 'Bro, muster up all the strength you've got. We're gonna get through this. It's fourth-and-long but we're gonna get a first down.'"

Both men received get-wells from their respective teams: Ma'ake, from the Ravens' Haloti Ngata and Torrey Smith, among others, and Chris, from Pittsburgh's Hines Ward and Heath Miller. The brothers will remain here for several months, then return home to Hawaii where they own a sports fitness center.

STANFORD, Calif. — Trent Edwards, who played quarterback for Stanford a decade ago, is back in the huddle again. Or so it seems. He's actually standing on the stage of a campus lecture hall and showing an audience of leading Silicon Valley sports minds the future of football.

Edwards is wearing a virtual-reality headset and everything he sees through his goggles is projected onto a big screen. A wave of "whoas" and "no ways" ripples through the crowd as the quarterback turns to his right and his left. Improbably, it looks and sounds as if Edwards is in the middle of a live Stanford practice.

SEATTLE — Like 50 percent of high school kids in foster care, Almeisha Robinson almost didn't graduate.

In her sophomore year, Robinson started meeting weekly with Mike Schloss, an education specialist at Treehouse. Rather than acting as a tutor going over specific coursework, Schloss would act as a coach, going over her goals and figuring out how she could best achieve them.

When Robinson tired of the disarray in her home life, she hatched a plan: She'd stay with her aunt who lived nearby until her parents cleaned up the house. But before the first day of her freshman year, Child Protective Services had decreed she could not return home.

On a Saturday afternoon in Burnsville, Minnesota, Edina led 12-2 at halftime and dismantled Cottage Grove, winning 27-8. Quickly, Paul Schmidt gathered his team and looked ahead to the next game, which would soon start. "When we go in the 'Diamond' down low, it's an inverted 'Diamond' that we're running, which is not what we really want. You guys know what 'inverted' means?" he asked.

CALAIS, France — The floor is sandy like the nearby dunes, the canvas roof is held up by tree branches covered in flowered cloth and the students seated at small desks are listening with soldierly attention.

"'Light' is 'lumiere,'" said the teacher, giving a French lesson in English to migrants from far corners of the globe, who have converged on a vast camp in the English Channel port city of Calais. "A lamp gives you light."

The single-room schoolhouse on one edge of the camp known as the "jungle" might seem like a mirage — but the four to six classes held there every day are packed with students.

The Chemin des Dunes School opened its small door — found in a dustbin — on July 11, the brainchild of Zimako Jones, a Nigerian living in the camp, where an estimated 3,000 migrants have staked out dwellings of sticks and tarp. They are among waves of migrants fleeing violence and poverty and arriving on Europe's shores, crossing internal European borders and straining asylum systems.

Humanitarian associations have helped contribute supplies such as notebooks and pens. Jaumotte bought the paints, brushes and small pots for each desk in her art class.

Zimako is humble about his accomplishment. And he keeps thinking big: He wants to build a second, larger school.

The new schedule has unleashed protests from teachers and petitions from parents. Caught flat-footed, the deeply unpopular government of President Francois Hollande, who pledged the reform during his election campaign last year, is struggling to defend it.

Although the brouhaha may seem to outsiders like a classic case of French whine, officials say it centers on a serious issue. Because French students had Wednesdays off, as well as a relatively short school year, educators were forced to pack more hours into each remaining school day in order to achieve an annual amount of instruction time comparable to other developed nations.

In other words, fewer school days mean much longer ones. Children as young as 6 often remain in class until late in the afternoon, as skies darken and parents get off work.

Adding Wednesday to the mix is supposed to alleviate that burden, at a time when the declining performance of French students is becoming a source of heavy concern. About a quarter of the country's primary schools have already adjusted their calendars, with the rest expected to follow suit next year.

That French schoolchildren have had Wednesdays off is a quirk of history.

When France instituted universal public education in the late 19th century, the government granted a weekly day off for children to attend catechism by the Roman Catholic Church. Many schools threw open their doors on Saturday mornings to make up for the lost teaching time, but in 2008, then-President Nicolas Sarkozy's administration decided that a four-day school week was sufficient.

In Paris, parents are fuming that instead of five days of equal length, the city's new school schedule is a crazy quilt, with no consecutive days ending at the same time.

And moms and dads who have artfully arranged their French 35-hour workweeks to spend Wednesdays with their tots feel shafted.

Although some children do attend catechism, today's highly secular parents have found Wednesdays useful not for religious instruction but for their kids' music lessons, sports practice and other non-academic pursuits that get short shrift in the highly regimented French education system. Businesses have sprung up to cater to the Wednesday whims of middle-class families, offering such get-ahead programs for youngsters as English classes.

The situation in the suburban housing projects defies France's model for integration — assimilation by which all colors, races and creeds blend into a single people. It's illegal to count people in France by ethnic or religious background, and diverse populations are expected to blend in — not live in ethnic enclaves.

When he was president, Nicolas Sarkozy made fixing the suburbs a priority. He created a Ministry of Immigration, Integration and National Identity — since dismantled — and in 2008 unveiled a master plan. It included $728 million to create new trains and tramways, an expansion of "second-chance schools" for dropouts, and professional guidance for thousands of youths wanting to start a company or get on a job track. It also included more police.

The housing project that was home to Amedy Coulibaly, one of the Paris gunmen this month, remains a different universe from the gilded governmental palaces of the capital, just a few miles away. Some doctors and postal workers refuse to venture into the Grande Borne in the town of Grigny. Even police enter with caution to a zone where drug dealers and teenage thugs hold sway.

Some improvements are visible in suburbs that received attention after the 2005 riots. In what was once one of the toughest projects in the Paris region, known as Les Bosquets (The Groves) in the town of Montfermeil northeast of Paris, high-rises and long buildings scarred with graffiti have been demolished, and replaced with human-sized town houses.

A police station has been installed in neighboring Clichy-Sous-Bois — where the 2005 riots got started. However, a long-promised tramway to reduce the approximately 90-minute journey by bus and train to nearby Paris and its job prospects has not yet materialized, and may not be in place before 2019.

Samir Ouahfi, a 29-year-old father of three working in a cafe in Les Bosquets, had little hope that the current government would do better than its predecessors.

"They say there is equality and fraternity," he said, referring to the French national motto. But here on the gray concrete of the projects, he added, "there isn't any."
The government wants to add multi-disciplinary classes and cut a well-respected bilingual program that enrolls about 15 percent of top students in favor of expanding foreign language classes to a broader range of younger children. Students will start learning their first foreign language — usually English — in the equivalent of first grade and their second foreign language around age 12.

## A Radical Plan

The New Haven Promise is no one-way street.  Although the scholarship is available to all students, they must sign a pledge to "do their best" in certain vital areas of achievement.  To earn the scholarship, students must not only live in New Haven and attend New Haven public schools, but also earn a minimum 3.0 grade point average (GPA) upon graduation, maintain a 90 percent attendance record, and have a good disciplinary record. Students must also complete 40 hours of community service at a community organization.

School officials are realizing they must develop a mindset of success, rather than failure, in even the youngest students. In New Haven, there is a new plan called College Summit. The goal is to create an expectation that all students can and will attend college. Raising students' expectations must start well before high school. Students need the confidence, commitment and good study habits to envision themselves in college, doing college-level work.

WASHINGTON — Thousands more students could be eating school lunch completely free starting next fall, thanks to a 4-year-old federal program that is finally expanding to all 50 states.

The expansion comes through the so-called Community Eligibility Provision, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010 as part of a [broader school nutrition measure](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=school+lunch). It opened the door for districts with free or reduced-price lunches to offer the meals to every student at the school, at no cost to them — no application necessary and regardless of household income.

Originally, districts had until the end of June to decide, but the federal government extended the deadline into August to give districts more time, especially after some delays in publishing the list of schools or districts eligible.

There's no real-time tracking of how many new districts will participate this year, but state and local education officials are weighing it. In most states, hundreds of schools are eligible, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and an analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In Chicago, officials have moved slowly: They started with 215 schools, expanded to 465, and will cover all 658 schools starting next school year.

St. Paul, Minnesota, is another district that is moving slowly. Jean Ronnei, the chief operations officer, said the district is doing a "test drive," implementing the program at one high school, one middle school and a few elementary schools.

Today, the MUSIC Inc. program at KIPP, a charter school, is hoping to accommodate 12 families on a waiting list, Dupuis said, and officials also are trying – through a fundraising effort – to expand their efforts into more under-served Chicago neighborhoods.

"Madison used to be really shy, but she just played her violin before a few hundred people at a youth pageant at our church," Wiggins said. "This is something that never occurred to me, because I don't play an instrument, but playing the violin has helped Madison develop into a person who is responsible. She takes such good care of her instrument. She's much more confident and has the ability now to speak in front of a group."

Ammar called it the hardest decision he'd ever made. His words disturbed and divided French Jews and non-Jews alike, and evoked Nazi-era fears.

U.S. Muslim women who wear headscarves are sharing guidance about what to do if they feel threatened, and some non-Muslims are wearing the hijab out of solidarity. Harassment, threats and vandalism directed at American Muslims has reportedly grown recently, notably in the wake of Islamic State-linked attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California, and comments by U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Friction is both the boon and the bane of our everyday lives. It's the force that drags against your car's tires, making you use more gas to keep going. It's also the force that allows your car to stop at all: Without friction, brakes would be dead weight. Although most of us take friction for granted when we hit the stop pedal, many of its details are still a mystery.

While this basic description generally holds true, even for Michael Jackson, many subtleties of friction remain mysterious. "We've got these nice little high school formulas that work in a lot of basic cases," Weymouth says. "But we're very bad at taking two arbitrary surfaces and saying what the friction will be." That's why Weymouth and his colleagues aimed to get a better understanding of what happens to single atoms when one brushes up against another. "When you rub your hands against each other and feel this frictional force, you're feeling the interaction between millions of atoms," Weymouth says. "But we're trying to simplify it down to the smallest physical system we can really reasonably measure—that's one atom against another."

And he did. Using a statistical method known as a Bayesian approach, Alroy estimated the probability of past extinctions for certain types of amphibians and reptiles, including frogs, salamanders, snakes and lizards, using museum collections and published documents to figure out when an animal was last sighted. He found that frogs seemed to be the most vulnerable to extinction - the results suggested that more than 3 percent of all frog species have disappeared, largely since the 1970s.

Every predator needs to catch its prey. We humans use our hands, sharks and wolves use their jaws, but a few animals like frogs use something much stranger: their tongues.

To understand just how frogs snatch their snacks, scientists made the first direct measurements of the amphibians' tongues in action. They found that certain frogs can lift meals up to three times heavier than their body weight (although they probably couldn't eat them) using a sticking mechanism similar to the tacky glue on Post-it notes, according to a study published this week in the journal Scientific Reports.

For the experiment, the researchers recruited the horned frog, a rotund South American amphibian with devilish protrusions above its eye sockets that has proved itself a popular pet. Horned frogs prefer to hunker down and wait for their prey to wander by before snagging their victims with powerful tongues. Their stationary habits make them easy subjects to use in studies, and they are known for their voracious appetites — they have been caught tackling prey more than half their size.

Just before mealtimes, the scientists inserted glass plates fitted with pressure sensors into the frogs' quarters about an inch from their faces. Then they offered up tantalizing grasshoppers behind the glass. When the hungry frogs fired their "ballistic tongues" (yes, that's an actual scientific term), the sensors measured the impact force. The tongue prints they left behind gave scientists an indication of the contact area and the amount of mucus on the tongue.

FRESNO, Calif. — Mountain residents and the Fresno County sheriff are squaring off against a federal wildlife agency over frogs and toads — an Endangered Species Act fight that spreads like wildfire along the Sierra Nevada.

Fish and Wildlife leaders say they are not proposing to shut down forests.

The species in question are two distinct populations of the mountain yellow-legged frog and the Yosemite toad. A widespread fungus, fish predation and loss of habitat are decimating them.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in April proposed protection under the Endangered Species Act after years of pressure from environmentalists.

In the process, the service also proposed 1.83 million acres of critical habitat for the amphibians in 17 counties, including Fresno. The areas are considered essential for the amphibians to survive.

But worried people in counties from Lassen to Tulare asked for a delay so they could make more in-depth comments. Fish and Wildlife obliged, extending the comment period from June to Nov. 18.

In Fresno County, the mention of the protections stirred bad memories of logging cutbacks in the 1990s as a result of U.S. Forest Service protections for such sensitive species as the California spotted owl.

The owl was not an [endangered or threatened species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). But the U.S. Forest Service plans were designed to protect large, old trees — preferred owl habitat. Logging was dramatically cut back, and most lumber mills shut down in this part of the mountain range. Towns such as Auberry and North Fork were hit hard.

Mims later said she was concerned about the added red tape for new or expanding businesses. Fish and Wildlife leaders say they were not invited to the Prather meeting. They say there may be a misunderstanding about the 1.83 million acres designated as critical habitat.

The designation applies only to federal land or projects needing federal permits, spokesman Mole said. Under those scenarios, Fish and Wildlife must be consulted. The agency is routinely involved in many kinds of these projects.

In California's San Joaquin Valley, for instance, the Madera Water Bank is in the habitat for the protected blunt-nosed leopard lizard, Fresno kangaroo rat, San Joaquin Kit Fox and other protected species.

Throughout California, more than 300 species of plants and animals are under federal protection — more animals than any other state and second-most for plants.

Environmentalists and some scientists have been pushing for a decade to list the Sierra amphibians under the Endangered Species Act. The die-off of these animals has been swift and alarming in the past two decades, say biologists.

The U.S. Geological Survey study this month revealed evidence that pesticides used in Central Valley agriculture are somehow drifting up into the Sierra and accumulating in amphibians. The chemicals add to the amphibians' stress, scientists say.

Many amphibian species, including those in the Sierra, face extinction around the globe from similar conditions, Vredenburg said.

The frogs and toads are an important link in the food chain, consuming insects and providing prey for other creatures. As such, they are part of a mountain ecosystem that improves air and water quality.

The high-mountain meadows and lakes where the frogs live must be protected to give them a chance at survival, Vredenburg said.

CORNUCOPIA, Wis. — On some days, Kevin Hunt stands at his Star North gas station in this eye-blink of a town on mighty Lake Superior, marveling at Mother Nature and his own dumb luck. Everywhere he looks: ice and people.

The Army Corps of Engineers estimates that a monthlong delay in freeing up the shipping channels — scheduled for March 25 — could mean $160 million in lost revenue.

"People are looking for more flavor," said Mark Carroll, senior director for produce and floral at Gelson's Markets, which will carry the Cotton Candy grape. "Once they get hooked, they want more no matter what."

Ordinary grapes like the red Flame Seedless can cost as little as 88 cents a pound. The Cotton Candy could fetch around $6 a pound, though prices would come down if enough growers cultivate the grape.

California is now churning out other sweet inventions, including apriums (a pluot but with more apricot), peacharines (peach and nectarine) and cherums (cherry and plum).

Cain got his start in the 1970s as a researcher with the USDA developing new varieties of table grapes and seedless raisins in Fresno, Calif. Then, most fruit breeding was done by the government or universities that could afford the time-consuming and expensive work.

He jumped to the private sector in 1987, just as U.S. grape consumption was exploding, thanks to new seedless varieties developed in California.

Cain helped start International Fruit Genetics in 2001. A few months later at a trade event he tasted the grape that has obsessed him ever since.

What if he could take the unique flavor of that Eastern U.S. native and meld it with Californian qualities such as superior crunch, thin skin and generous size?

International Fruit Genetics signed a licensing agreement with the University of Arkansas. By 2003, Cain was cross-pollinating their grapes with a dozen California varieties on his test field, 80 acres of dusty vineyards in Delano, north of Bakersfield.

MATSUMOTO, Japan — The 12-year-old girl didn't want to leave her younger brother, and her grandparents didn't want her to go away. But a family living near the "no-go zone" surrounding Japan's destroyed nuclear plant has other things to consider.

The next time you receive some cash, inspect it carefully. Fake bills are circulating in the U.S. economy and you don't want to be the one stuck holding funny money.

Even though the design of our currency has become more sophisticated, authorities report that criminals are able to use ever-improving technology to counterfeit bills that can fool most people.

In November, federal agents arrested a Georgia man who stands accused of printing more than $1 million in phony $50 bills. Heath J. Kellogg and five other men, who are believed to be his accomplices, allegedly sold the fake money for real currency, or used it to purchase expensive items that they would later return for cash.

The Treasury Department, which is responsible for printing the U.S. money supply, takes many precautions to make sure our currency is extremely hard to copy. For example, the $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills all include watermark portraits that can be seen in the paper when you hold it up to the light.

Authorities say Kellogg, a self-taught graphic artist, allegedly put paper through a printer to give it a yellowish tint. He then printed the front side of the money on one piece of paper. On a separate sheet, he printed the back of the bill, and then flipped it over and printed a watermark. He sprayed glue to stick the sheets of paper together. By doing this, he was able to simulate the watermark.

The forgery was good, but not good enough to fool investigators from the U.S. Secret Service. The agency that is better known for providing bodyguards for the president and his family also has another important duty: protecting the nation's money from counterfeiters.

In fact, the Secret Service was established almost 150 years ago, after the Civil War, when counterfeiting was so common that almost one-third of the money in circulation was phony.

On the chain-link fence that surrounds the courts, spray paint marks the goals. Shots whiz by like cars on a freeway.

English and Spanish blend as players chant "Corre! Corre!" ("Run!") and "Mira! Mira!" ("Look!"). The murmurs from onlookers — "nice" and "wow" — swell after each dazzling play.

The matches on this concrete court are quick. The first team to score wins. Losers retreat to wooden benches, ceding to the next challenger.

With existing soccer fields beaten down from constant use and a lack of green space in urban neighborhoods to build more, futsal has rolled into parks across the nation to meet the growing demand of soccer-loving millennials.

Nearly every player prefers a more forgiving field of grass, but futsal courts have come to be viewed as the best available option (not to mention that building a futsal court costs about $25,000, or 10 percent of the bill for a normal soccer field).

Parks officials say the demand for soccer space is so strong that some areas meant for tennis, basketball or volleyball have seen more soccer balls bounced on them than anything else in recent years — providing another sign of how the nation's growing Latino population is reshaping landscapes.

Nearly 100 percent of the students — 165 of the 175 enrolled — have joined Future Farmers of America (FFA), the venerable agriculture and leadership organization. The students compete against schools five times their size and still come home with first-place ribbons and trophies.

The widespread practice, by some recyclers and waste dealers, of exporting electronic waste to developing countries has created bustling scrap economies in poor parts of China and Africa while exposing large numbers of people to toxins and carcinogens.

"We receive almost 200 different types of electronics," Kianipay said. "There's no limit to the models and types."

The name "gaga" to some may initially conjure images of a female singer. But the gaga at playgrounds and camps is actually a decades-old game. Many believe it originated in Israel. Gaga means "touch, touch" in Hebrew. It was being played at some Jewish summer camps in the United States by the early 1970s, but the game's popularity is much greater nowadays and growing.

The findings, described in Astrophysical Journal Letters, reveal a surprisingly active, bright galaxy near the very dawn of the cosmos that could shed light on what the universe, now 13.8 billion years old, was really like in its young, formative years.

"We're actually looking back through 95 percent of all time to see this galaxy," said study coauthor Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz. "It's really a galaxy in its infancy ... when the universe was in its infancy."

As astronomers push the limits of current telescopes and await the completion of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, set for launch in 2018, scientists may soon find more of these galaxies even closer to the birth of the universe than this new record breaker.

These consequences — criminal activity, illegal manufacturing and distribution, and more — took years and significant resources to fully combat. All for the act to later be repealed.

Naively assuming a ban would absolve American's interest and participation in online gaming sets up local, state and federal law enforcement with tremendous expenses and turn millions of average American citizens into criminals.

State lotteries are a perfect example of leveraging long-standing entertainment to help subsidize public-sector treasuries. However, the large number of states that have kept up with 21st-century technologies by offering online lottery would also be jeopardized through wide-sweeping federal prohibition.

Even recovering problem gamblers may not be able to undo the damage done to their finances and relationships, particularly their marriages.

While legalizing online gambling may seem like an attractive solution to a state's budget woes, evidence suggests the contrary. Gambling is a regressive tax that disproportionately impacts the poor, diverting money away from local businesses and displacing existing sales tax revenue while fueling societal ills.

That's the idea behind "Citizen Science," a game that teaches players about lake ecosystems. It's part of the catalog of Games + Learning + Society, which bills itself as one of the longest standing games-for-learning research centers in the world. Working out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, GLS is a key player in a growing field that brings together scientists, educators and game designers to augment traditional science education with games that engage students with dynamic, immersive lessons.

This hulking dinosaur stood two stories tall at its shoulder and weighed as much as seven Tyrannosaurus rex. It measured 85 feet from head to tail, including its 37-foot-long neck and 30-foot-long muscular tail.

Scientists are hesitant to say that Dreadnoughtus schrani is the largest dinosaur species that ever lived, but it is certainly right up there.

Its name is a tribute to its gigantic size. "Dreadnought," which essentially means "fearing nothing," was used to describe a class of mammoth battleships that dominated the high seas in the early 20th century.

Nothing could have attacked Dreadnoughtus schrani and won, paleontologists say. It was simply too big.

"I found a little cluster of broken-up bones and recorded it in my GPS," said Lacovara, the lead author of a report on the find, which was published Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports. "But I also recorded 10 other sites on my GPS that morning."

Even when two of his team members began cleaning the bones later that day and realized that they were pieces of a giant femur bone, Lacovara was blase.

Paleontologists are particularly excited about the find because the animals were so well preserved, particularly the larger one. More than 45 percent of that skeleton has been recovered (though its small skull is missing). That will allow scientists to better understand how these enormous animals loped about.

"Such complete specimens of large-bodied sauropods are critical for better developing biomechanical models aimed at understanding how these largest of land-living organisms actually moved around," O'Connor said.

Dreadnoughtus is a type of titanosaurian sauropod, a diverse group of dinosaurs that lived in the Southern Hemisphere during the final 30 million years of the age of the dinosaurs. These animals would have had to eat almost all the time to sustain their colossal body mass; Lacovara imagines them as eating machines, using their long necks to graze on a wide swath of plant life.

Decades passed before she learned the full story — one that would not only answer painful questions about her past but help Australians understand one of the ugliest chapters in theirs.

After one night, Molly persuaded the other two girls to escape with her. Pretending they were going to the edge of the camp to empty their slop buckets, they fled when no one was looking.

The U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to supporters of gay marriage on Wednesday, striking down part of a federal law that would have prevented same-sex couples from getting federal benefits.

The court also opened the door for gay marriages to resume in California, in a separate ruling on narrow legal grounds.

The decisions stopped short of saying that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage. The court did not decide whether states that do not have same-sex marriage will have to recognize marriages performed in other states. Twelve states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriages, and gay marriages are expected to resume in California this year.

President Barack Obama praised the court for its decisions.

Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that the law violated the Fifth Amendment's protection of liberty, and that the purpose of the law was to make same-sex marriages less valid than marriages between a man and a woman.

"The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages," Kennedy wrote.

At stake are a host of federal benefits and programs, including immigration rights, student loans and taxes.

The case was brought by Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in Canada in 2007. Their marriage was recognized in New York, where they lived, when Spyer died in 2009. Windsor had to pay $363,053 in taxes on Spyer's estate that she would not have had to pay if, in her words, she had married "Theo" instead of Thea.

The court "brings us that much closer to true equality," said David Boies. He was one of the attorneys who represented the plaintiffs who sued to overturn Proposition 8, the law approved by California voters that made same-sex marriage illegal. "Our plaintiffs now get to go back to California and, together with every other citizen of California, marry the person they love," he said.

After four weeks of ferocious fighting, the guns of Gaza fell silent Tuesday with a 72-hour truce in place and talks on tap in Egypt aimed at forging a stable accord between Israel and Palestinian militants who rule the coastal enclave.

GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Israeli troops battled Hamas militants on Wednesday near a southern Gaza Strip town as the top U.S. diplomat reported progress in efforts to end fighting that has so far killed more than 680 Palestinians and 34 Israelis.

In Jerusalem, Kerry said negotiations toward a Gaza cease-fire were making some progress as he met for a second time this week with Ban. "We certainly have made steps forward," Kerry said. "There's still work to be done."

Part of the problem for researchers, doctors and ethicists alike is defining "enhancement" and deciding if it would be a move in the right direction, as the word would suggest. Is enhancement merely referring to boosting muscle tone and other desirable traits like achieving perfect pitch or does the term also encompass steps to guarantee better health by preventing disease? Some scientists disagreed over whether certain types of gene-editing would be important for helping patients, with one prominent researcher contending the technology would not often be needed, while another described dire current clinical needs for it. The international summit on gene editing, sponsored by Britain's Royal Society, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the US National Academies, has grappled with such thorny questions during three days of sometimes-heated discussion on editing the human genome.

This was once a godlike power: moving genes from one living creature to another. Then it became the realm of big-budget labs. Three years ago, the University of California, Berkeley, invented the so-called CRISPR gene-editing tool — on which Zayner models his kits — offering a cheap, fast, precise and powerful way to edit genetic sequences. But its use remained confined to academic and commercial settings.

Zayner is the first to market a simplified version of the tool to the masses — a project that, for now, is more provocative than perilous. The kit has limited applications. His altered bacteria and yeast, quite harmless, lead brief and fairly dull lives. They can't do much except change color, fragrance or live in inhospitable places. Then they die. 

ATLANTA — Georgia school leaders are turning down a new option to arm teachers, arguing that it doesn't make kids any safer and creates more problems than state lawmakers intended to solve.

"We could give (teachers) all the training in the world as to how to a shoot a gun, but knowing when to shoot poses a major problem," said Steve Smith, superintendent of the Bibb County School District. "The folks we work with day in and day out don't have that."

The provision was part of a sweeping law that expands where Georgians can legally carry guns. It took effect July 1 and includes bars and churches. GOP lawmakers pushed the bill through during an election year in the largely pro-gun state, giving each district the option of arming teachers or staff — but requiring them to set training standards. The provisions were similar to a program that drew no interest from South Dakota school districts, and education officials said no districts in Georgia are pursuing it so far either.

Rep. Alan Powell, a Hartwell Republican who chairs the Georgia House of Representatives committee on public safety, said lawmakers intentionally left the decision to school boards. He argued that weapon-free zones are targets.

But others saw big room for improvement, especially in the area of public warnings.

With debate sharpening across Europe over the daunting burden of taking in so many people fleeing war and hardship, Germany's public schools will become the proving ground in a vast social experiment. Some question whether the country's educational system — highly regarded, but generally considered rigid in its practices and approach — will be nimble enough to adjust to rapidly changing needs posed by the influx, even though it has done so before.

"It is the largest cache held by a private individual illegally — by miles," Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register in London, which tracks vanished works of art, said Monday. "Two years ago we found a dealer who had two stolen pictures in his safe when he died, and we thought that was pretty shocking because he had actually been put in jail by the French in 1946 for being part of the Holocaust looting. ... To find one on this scale is exceptional."

One day, a love of books brought a young German soldier named Johannes Gerhardt into the store. He was so enchanted by the books that when he left the store, he forgot his rifle. A young man named Mels de Jong chased him down and reminded him of the weapon. Soon they became friends. De Jong was married to Sam van Perlstein's daughter.

The documents they created were perfect, and fooled everyone who needed to be fooled. They allowed van Perlstein to reclaim the import business and money that had been frozen. That money went to fund resistance to the Nazis, and a hideaway network.

Klemke, who later in life was known for perfectionism in printing down to the choices of paper, typefaces and inks for the books in which his work was published, made up a cover story to hide his work from his Nazi superiors. He told them that he could make nice booklets of cocktail recipes for them if he could only get a small graphics office set up.

But the aid came, and it helped locals rebuild their lives.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP119301820680.jpg" /> NEW YORK — Four score and 70 years ago, a Pennsylvania newspaper chided Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address as "silly remarks."

"He was a very thoughtful writer, and it shows," Hamill said, referring both to the penmanship and the substance of the speech, which was short — about two minutes — but memorable.

So too was the dissing it received in some media, a scoff that haunted the Harrisburg editors until their editorial, which ran Thursday with a column explaining the decision to declare: "The Patriot-News regrets the error."

Tipping the scales at more than 1,700 pounds each, the Martins' pumpkins are actually a bit on the slender side compared with other giant pumpkins grown in Wisconsin this year.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Tablet_V_of_the_Epic_of_Gligamesh.png" />One of the consequences of the violent upheavals in Syria and Iraq has been the systematic and wanton pillaging of some of the region's most ancient sites. The jihadist Islamic State has vandalized, bulldozed, exploded and plundered numerous shrines, temples and palaces that predate the advent of Islam in the Middle East. The extremists, along with other smugglers and opportunists, have also enabled an illicit trade of priceless, historic treasures from a part of the world long known as the cradle of civilizations.

But researchers examining the tablets soon realized there was one particularly exciting find: a tablet, in three fragments, etched in cuneiform script with what appeared to be previously unknown lines from the Epic of Gilgamesh, the 4,000-year-old Sumerian legend that some consider humanity's oldest story. The legend tells of the travails of Gilgamesh, the great king of Uruk, who journeys with his friend Enkidu, a semi-divine wild man, into the Cedar Forest to defeat the ogre Humbaba.

The 20 new lines offer some new details and insights into the Epic. Ancient History outlines a few:

LOS ANGELES — For decades, toymakers believed the industry gospel: Boys want to build things; girls want to play princess.

But now, female CEOs are leading huge corporations, including Yahoo Inc. and General Motors Corp., and more women are becoming engineers and mathematicians. Meanwhile, toy companies are realizing that girls want to build bridges and wire circuits.

But after years ignoring the space, toy companies have been paying close attention to how girls like to build.

Watch your knees, girls.

A new study in Pediatrics, the journal for the American Academy of Pediatrics, found that anterior cruciate ligament injuries are on the rise, and girls are more likely to get this injury than their male friends.

The total membership — now 2.66 million — is down more than 15 percent over three years, and down 30 percent from a peak of more than 3.8 million in 2003.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — For 60 years, rough glacial terrain east of Anchorage held tight the 52 men killed when their Air Force plane slammed into Mount Gannett on Nov. 22, 1952. Now, for the second summer running, plane wreckage and human remains are being given up by Colony Glacier, more than a dozen miles from the crash site.

Crews last year removed all that they found, except one tire, Berg said. Now they have whole new areas from which to extract pieces of lives and the plane itself.

"As the glacier melts and as the glacier moves, more materials come up to the surface," Berg told reporters last week. "So this year, what we've seen is a dramatic shift down glacier, which has then brought new materials to light, No. 1."

Fresh snow 8 feet deep was already covering the glacier and drifted snow near the wreckage piled up to hundreds of feet, according to a statement by Air Force 1st Lt. Thomas Sullivan, who was flown to the site by then-University of Alaska President Terris Moore, a pilot in the Civil Air Patrol. The impact also appeared to trigger avalanches that further buried the debris.

The show is spare: a few steamer trunks, cloth sheets, some wood beams and rope are all the scenery on hand, and the actors play multiple roles as well as instruments such as drums, violins and mandolins. But there's no denying the words and message from an exuberant cast. The audience included actress Kim Cattrall and performance artist Laurie Anderson in the front row.

The tour involves a portable set and a 12-person, multicultural cast that includes Hong Kong-born actress Jennifer Leong and Maori actor Rawiri Paratene. The production is directed by Dromgoole and Bill Buckhurst, who travel with four stage managers.

This year alone, more than 60 whales entangled in fishing gear have been spotted along the coast — a more than 400 percent spike over normal and a pattern that began in 2014. Scientists believe the whales may be following prey closer to shore as warm water influences feeding patterns, putting them on a collision course with fishermen, crabbers and lobstermen.

The situation is so dire that the crab fishery has begun working closely with state and federal agencies and environmental groups to figure out where and how the whales are running into their gear. The ocean mammals also have become entangled in gill nets and lobster gear, but authorities have identified the crab fishery as the most urgent concern.

The salmon has an added growth hormone from the Pacific Chinook salmon that allows that fish to produce growth hormone all year long. Engineers have been able to keep the hormone active by using another gene from an eel-like fish called an ocean pout that acts like an "on" switch. Typical Atlantic salmon produce the growth hormone for only part of the year.

For the next week, the 70 goats — known as "eco-goats" — will eat the vines, poison ivy, dense vegetation and anything they can reach to clean up a densely vegetated parcel on the cemetery grounds.

"We're trying to prevent invasive species from eating the trees and having them fall on the historic headstones," said Paul Williams, the president of the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery. "We don't want to utilize chemicals, due to our riverside location and because of our membership-only, off-leash dog-walking program."

The floppy-eared brown and white goats, including Yoda, Buckaroo and Mimi, were camera-shy environmental pioneers at first, refusing to leave their trailer, emerging briefly and then running back in to avoid news crews.

After the cemetery and humane society officials moved the media herd, the goats ran into the 1.6-acre enclosed area and started doing what they do best: chomping everything green and leafy in sight. The sight of them chewing vines and their fairly constant bleating delighted about a half-dozen children. "It's actually an ancient custom," said Williams, who's trying to be innovative and to bring new life and activities to the cemetery. "I kind of hope it opens people's minds to alternatives."

Hiring the 70 goats is a thrifty move, too. They're capable of reaching vines as high as 7 feet, and the bill for their trouble will be $4,000 for six days of work, which Williams said worked out to a bargain. "This is an exciting opportunity for us to demonstrate the positive aspects of using goats to help reduce and control problem vegetation," said Brian Knox, the owner of Eco-Goats in Annapolis.

The city of Paris began using sheep this past spring as eco-mowers to keep the lawn trim outside the French capital's municipal archives.

Congressional Cemetery is quite tidy, dotted with small trees among the headstones, obelisks and monuments known as cenotaphs, memorials for those buried elsewhere. A quaint chapel sits in the middle of the grounds, along with a public vault that dates to 1832, where the remains of many famous deceased were stored temporarily before being buried elsewhere, including first lady Dolley Madison.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — If you've bought Cheddar Goldfish snacks in the past four years, one fed-up Lake Worth, Florida, mom wants to help you get your money back.

Disgusted by what her complaint calls false advertising, Palm Beach County elementary schoolteacher Lisa Leo has taken Pepperidge Farm to court, accusing the mammoth food manufacturer of mislabeling its popular fish-shaped crackers "natural" when she contends they contain genetically modified soybeans.

Her lawsuit, filed June 11 in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, seeks class-action status, new labels and at least $5 million in damages to reimburse Florida consumers who purchased the snack since June 2009, claiming the product violates Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.

"Consumers have a right to know what they're putting in their bodies," said Joshua Eggnatz, Leo's Weston-based attorney. "You may not think GMOs are bad for you, but others may, and the consumer has a right to know and to choose."

Genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are plant or animal products that have been re-engineered in a lab with the DNA of bacteria, viruses or other plants and animals to increase crop yield or make them heartier, more tolerant of herbicides, and resistant to insects, drought and other environmental factors. General estimates are that about 90 percent of the corn, cotton, soybeans and sugar beets grown in the United States are genetically altered, and they are most often used in highly processed foods like crackers and cereals.

The FDA has not officially defined what "natural" means in terms of food labels, but its website says the agency "has not objected to the use of the term if the food does not contain added color, artificial flavors, or synthetic substances."

Eggnatz said Leo did not want to comment for this story, and he offered few details about why she filed the action.

But according to the complaint, Leo purchased the snacks monthly from three stores in the suburban Boynton Beach area and "paid a premium" for them, believing that the "natural" label meant they contained no GMO ingredients.

Leo, whom Eggnatz described as a middle-aged mother of two and grandmother of one, would have gone with cheaper, non-GMO options for her family's snacks had she known about the Goldfish's modified soybeans, according to the complaint, which does not allege that anyone in Leo's family was sickened by the product.

Amid the uproar is a national outcry for mandatory food labels in the United States. Congress is considering a bill that would direct the Food and Drug Administration to "clearly label" genetically modified foods. Florida and 14 other states are seeking to require the labels at the state level.

"I grew up at a time when a tomato was a tomato, and a piece of corn was a piece of corn," said Florida Rep. Mark Pafford, a Democrat from West Palm Beach. "Science, or technology, has changed that, and there's been a huge shift in our knowledge of what we're ingesting."

Pafford co-sponsored the bill considered during the 2013 Florida legislative session, but it died in committee. He and other co-sponsors plan to try again.

The food manufacturing lobby has so far been successful in beating back labeling mandates, arguing that consumers will assume that just because a product contains GMOs, it is somehow inferior or not as safe.

"It's a hugely controversial topic, and when you look at both sides, they seem to make a lot of sense," said Lillian Craggs-Dino, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic in Weston. "There are no easy answers in this one."

The groundswell of public pressure for labels has persuaded Whole Foods to become the first major supermarket chain to require suppliers to add GMO labels to their products, setting 2018 as the deadline. Florida-based Publix, meanwhile, is following the lead of the Food Marketing Institute, a large industry association that is "calling for education, labeling and standards for genetically modified foods," Publix spokeswoman Kimberly Reynolds said.

While the debate rages on, consumers can take certain steps to avoid GMOs without having to rely on labels, accurate or otherwise, Craggs-Dino said: They can buy products certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as organic.

And then there's another method, endorsed by Carol Sherman, a registered dietitian in Boca Raton. "Just use your common sense," she said. "In reality, if you think Pepperidge Farms Goldfish are natural, you have to be kidding yourself. Goldfish are a highly processed food," the most likely candidate to have genetically altered ingredients.
Much of what we know about how chimpanzees behave is thanks to one person: Jane Goodall.

When she was in her early 20s, Goodall got an invitation from a school friend to visit Africa. She became obsessed with the idea and worked hard to earn enough money to get there. Silvey says, "I don't think that's what many other people would do."

CHICAGO — Disadvantaged teens may get more than an academic boost by attending top-notch high schools — their health may also benefit, a study suggests.

Professor Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago public health researcher, said the study is important and highlights the challenge — and need to — create "a much larger number of schools that serve kids well."

Pollack said better academic performance among the charter school kids is likely more important for their long-term health than their risky behavior choices.

"Educational outcomes are just so critical for people's well-being," he said.
Soon it shot into the sky, soaring thousands of feet with a payload of sophisticated radio gear, processors and solar panels. Its launch Friday was part an offbeat experiment by Google in using lighter-than-air balloons, a concept pioneered in the 18th century, to solve the 21st-century problem of delivering Internet service to underserved parts of the world.

They're now embarking on a new series of tests in California's Central Valley, aimed at working out the answers to a multitude of technical questions that must be resolved to make the project work.

"Our main challenge right now is power," said Sameera Ponda, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained aerospace engineer hired by Google to work on the project. She explained that the Loon team needs more data to decide how to configure the solar array and batteries so they can keep a balloon's radio equipment and computers running for weeks at a time, even at night, at frigid altitudes of 12 miles or more above the Earth.

The launch was also webcast for an audience of young tech enthusiasts, who watched the action and relayed questions to Ponda and another Loon project staffer, Paul Acosta. The kids participated through an Internet video "field trip" organized by Google and Maker Camp, a free online summer program for teens who like to build things and figure out how they work.

While the idea could work, Bennett said, it's still not clear who would pay for operating and maintaining the balloon network. Google has been vague about its plans; Bennett speculated the company may be hoping that telecommunications carriers will adopt the idea if Google can show it's commercially feasible.

Rogers planned to recover it, but in case someone else found it first, the plastic foam box holding its electronic gear carried a label that read, "Harmless Science Experiment," and another that provided a phone number to call.
The main goal of the tidy, gumdrop-shaped cars isn't to push Google into the business of building cars. Instead, the company wants to develop self-driving software that will "improve road safety and help people who can't drive."

But Google plans to build the bulk of the cars as fully autonomous — no steering wheel, no gas or brake pedal.

Inside will be a pair of seats with seat belts, space for your belongings, buttons to start and stop, and a screen showing where the car is going. California law is expected to allow the operation of such vehicles on public roads — with a permit — by the end of this year.

The cars were built with safety in mind. They have sensors that eliminate blind spots and look in every direction for more than 200 yards. The top speed of the first vehicles will be limited to 25 miles per hour (mph).

Congress has failed to meet the deadline for approving spending bills 17 times since the 1970s, resulting in partial shutdowns lasting from one day to three weeks. The last time was for a 21-day stretch in December 1995 and January 1996 when some — but not all — spending bills had been signed into law.

Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for lower deficits and debt, said a shutdown would not have as "profound or immediate an impact as people think." But, she said, "the fact that this is how we govern is so shameful."

The president and his political appointees would still report to work. Lawmakers would do the same, but would decide who on their staffs was essential.

"All of the government shuts down except the parts that are deemed essential services, and I think there's a great deal of latitude in that determination for the president," Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf told reporters. "So how much of the government stops working and how much keeps working is not something we have a good basis for predicting."

The administration would rely on a variety of documents, from Department of Justice legal opinions to Office of Management and Budget planning memos, as well as some history.

The law requires agencies to be staffed with unsalaried employees if they deal with national security, administer benefit payments or protect life and property, according to the OMB. And government operations not directly paid for by the Treasury would continue.

That means disaster aid to the Colorado flood victims would proceed but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would stop monitoring diseases. Mail delivery would continue but loan programs to small businesses, farmers and homeowners would cease. Inspectors would still regulate food and drugs but research programs would be halted. Taxes would be collected but judges would have to go home when the courts run out of funds.

Even the health-care law that is the focus of the dispute between Republicans and Democrats would continue to be implemented because much of its funding comes from other sources, including new taxes and fees and cuts to other programs.

ST. LOUIS — The proud parents who attended Lincoln Elementary's honor roll assemblies years ago assumed the school was a shining example of academic achievement.

JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — Andre Saraiva is an internationally known graffiti artist. He owns nightclubs in Paris and New York, works as a top editor of the men's fashion magazine L'Officiel Hommes and has appeared in countless glossy magazines as a tastemaker and bon vivant.

But graffiti artists tagging national parks are catering to a more irreverent online audience.

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. — At the rim of the Grand Canyon, busloads of Chinese tourists jostled on a recent day with 20-something backpackers and an Amish family with rambunctious boys in suspenders and straw hats, all eager for a prime viewing spot.

They gazed out on a dizzying sight of receding canyons and sheer rock walls, with the Colorado River cutting through the canyon floor a mile down.

The 1953 agreement, in which Greece and about 20 other countries effectively wrote off a large chunk of Germany's loans and restructured the rest, is a landmark case that shows how effective debt relief can be. It helped spark what became known as the German economic miracle.

Most of us think of the water cycle as something that occurs above ground — water falls from the sky, evaporates back into the atmosphere and then condenses into rain once again.

But above-ground water is just a fraction of our planet's water story.

Gleeson and his team report that there are 6 quintillion gallons of groundwater in the upper 1.2 miles of the Earth's crust. If you could magically pump it all out of the ground and spread it across the continents, it would form a layer of water 600 feet high, or twice the height of the Statue of Liberty.

The fabrics come in dazzling colors, interwoven in bands and geometric patterns, often worn as tunics or dresses. In Guatemala's design houses, that's translated into pumps, ties and purses that stand out from the usual sober colors displayed in high-end stores.

Recognizing those obstacles, some states have created programs to provide the next generation of farmers with the skills and land needed to be economically competitive. Missouri, Maryland and Virginia, for example, are among the states that help prospective farmers access available land, while Massachusetts, Minnesota and Delaware provide financial assistance to independent farmers who are just starting out, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Cybersecurity researchers uncovered a number of major security flaws in systems behind Hello Barbie, an Internet-connected doll that listens to children and uses artificial intelligence to respond. Vulnerabilities in the mobile app and cloud storage used by the doll could have allowed hackers to eavesdrop on even the most intimate of those play sessions, according to a report released Friday by Bluebox Security and independent security researcher Andrew Hay.

But the news comes on the heels of a major breach at VTech, a Hong Kong-based seller of toys for toddlers and young children, which exposed profiles on more than 6 million kids around the world. And Hello Barbie's security issues are yet another sign that Internet-connected devices are making their way into kids' hands with problems that leave privacy at risk.

The doll's talking features work by recording a child when it presses a button on its stomach and sending the audio file over the Internet to a server, where it is processed. The doll then responds with one of thousands of prerecorded messages. Parents must consent to the doll's terms of use and set it up via a mobile app.

After crossing the border, Moncher, the farmworker, said he would stay temporarily with a sister near Port-au-Prince, where he planned to drop off two of his children, then return to the Dominican Republic for the rest of his family. He hopes his relatives can help him find work in a country where more than half the population survives on less than $2 a day.

"His dad is really obsessed with superheroes," Robles said while strolling through a Spirit Halloween store outside Los Angeles.

Consumers altogether will spend $6.9 billion on Halloween this year, or an average of $74.34 each, the National Retail Federation estimates based on an annual survey conducted by the research firm Prosper Insights &amp; Analytics.

That's down from a peak of $8 billion, or $79.82 a consumer in 2012, but still more than double the Halloween spending of a decade ago.

Social media also has fueled the rise in Halloween's appeal because consumers love sharing information, photos and videos of their Halloween costumes, decorations and night-on-the-town escapades, analysts said.

When people were asked where they look for inspiration for costumes, the websites Facebook and Pinterest each drew 13 percent of the responses, the National Retail Federation said. Nearly one-third of consumers said they looked online overall for Halloween costumes.

"I post stuff after I pick out my outfit," especially on Facebook and Instagram, said Jessica Medina, 33, as she shopped at the Spirit Halloween store. "I also search online to see what's out there and my friends post things."

Consumer spending on Halloween still pales next to the winter holiday season, which includes Thanksgiving and Christmas and generates about $616 billion in sales. Halloween spending also trails spending on Mother's Day, Valentine's Day and Father's Day.

That's mainly because "Halloween is not a gift-giving holiday" much beyond candy for the kids, said National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy Grannis Allen.

Nonetheless, "it's still a huge business for a retailer," she said, although Halloween retail sales are expected to dip this year compared with 2014, in part because many consumers are re-using Halloween props and decorations they bought in recent years.

"We really think it comes down to several years of stocking up on Halloween goods and this year using more of what they already have," Allen said. Spending on decorations is expected to total $1.9 billion this year, down 7 percent from last year.

Still, Harris plans on celebrating by dressing up as Catwoman for two parties. At the St. Paul Wal-Mart store last week, she debated between a black-satin sequined cat mask vs. a leopard-festooned mask (with matching kitty tail). Both bore a price tag of about $5, and she plans on spending another $5 on makeup to complete her feline party look.

"We're definitely not seeing people spending less," said Roberta Bonoff, CEO and president of the Minneapolis-based children's store Creative Kidstuff. "People are still buying. Kids are kids, and they celebrate Halloween. No matter what goes on in the world, people will spend on their kids."

Each year, hundreds of new McDonald's U.S. general managers spend five days at Hamburger University on the burger giant's corporate campus, working toward an honorary bachelor's degree in Hamburgerology. During their visits, they role play, have meetings with their boss — in this case, a professor — and prepare to return home and make real improvements at the restaurants they run.

Criticism outside [Iran](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iran) was predictably swift Wednesday, with calls for freedom for the jailed youths zipping around social media. Williams tweeted: "It's beyond sad these kids were arrested for trying to spread happiness."

A tweet posted Wednesday evening on President Hassan Rouhani's account seemed to address the controversy, even if it stopped short of mentioning the video or the arrests directly.

The case was another reminder of the tensions that exist at the highest levels of Iranian power, with hard-liners determined to maintain the status quo while moderates try to push through change — be it improved relations with the West or a loosening of morality clampdowns at home.

Hard-liners are increasingly challenging Rouhani as the country negotiates a nuclear deal with world powers. The president campaigned for greater cultural and social freedoms in his bid to succeed Mahmoud Ahmadinejad last year.

"We should see the cyber world as an opportunity," said Rouhani, according to the official IRNA news agency. "Why are we so shaky? Why don't we trust our youth?"

Motorcycle thefts are on the decline, and of five major brands, only Harley-Davidson owners saw an uptick in the number of stolen bikes in 2013, new data from the National Insurance Crime Bureau show.

It's hard to say why more Harleys continue to be stolen, but some speculate the riders are too trusting — leaving their bikes unlocked and unattended because most fellow riders won't mess with them.

Still, there were 3,907 Harley-Davidsons stolen in the United States last year, up 4 percent from 2012, while the percentage of stolen Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki motorcycles fell 2.1 percent (Kawasaki) to 9.1 percent (Suzuki), according to data from the trade association based in Des Plaines, Illinois.

The bar was packed with people, Bidwell said, and he had just shown the bike to some of them three minutes earlier.

"We parked right in front of the bar. I was 15 feet from it," he said, about where the motorcycle was parked.

"We are not going to give up until she is home," the plea says.

Thousands of people have viewed the posting, and some of them swore they saw the bike in various places.

"Someone said they thought they saw it near Nashville (Tennessee)," Bidwell said about the motorcycle, which had $29,340 in accessories and had won nine custom motorcycle competitions.

"My word to everybody is 'lock up your bike.' I cannot stress that enough," he said.

PHILADELPHIA — The scenes are too common for comfort: A mother grabs her daughter's arm roughly on the bus. A father at a convenience store growls coarsely into his son's ear.

Harsh parenting unleashes so-called toxic stress in children, researchers say, changing the structure and functionality of their brains, heightening chances for negative behavior, and potentially condemning a child to a life hampered by heart disease, among other maladies.

Dave believes that, in part by writing poetry and by drawing, he exorcised demons and forestalled bequeathing toxic stress to his kids.

Her suit is the first time that the court has revisited affirmative action since its landmark ruling in the 2003 Grutter v. Bollinger case. If UT Austin's race-conscious admissions policy is not upheld, the decision has the potential to end affirmative action at colleges and universities across the country.

Fisher has been lambasted by members of the African-American community for suggesting that she deserved to attend UT Austin more than they do. And racial tensions surrounding the case increased Wednesday when, during oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia cited a friend-of-court brief contending that African-American students who benefit from affirmative action should instead opt for "slower-track" schools.

Just how many human beings were enslaved in the United States is a much debated topic. Records show that an estimated 450,000 Africans were kidnapped in Africa and brought to what became the United States. But generations of children born to those captives were slaves, too, and they numbered in the millions. By the time the Confederacy fell in 1865, the number of people who had been held as slaves over the decades would be similar to the 11 million murdered by Nazi Germany, demographers say.

The state has identified $1.3 million to expand services to homeless individuals and families, Morishige said. In addition to a new shelter, the money also would go to the state's Housing First program, which provides homes and services to chronically homeless individuals without requiring them to get sober or treat mental illness first, and programs that help families pay deposits and rent.

"If they're living in tents now, the individual units are going to be just as large or larger," said Chris Sadayasu, asset management administrator for the Honolulu Office of Strategic Development.

A red cinder trail leads from the heart of this small enclave through a plain of billowing, rock-hard pahoehoe lava to the ocean. Ferns grow in deep crevasses. Coconuts brought by visitors have sprouted and struggle to grow in the inhospitable ground. Waves crash.

But the man in the headdress was singer Pharrell Williams, who is not, last time anyone knew, Native American.

When that picture appeared on the July cover of fashion magazine Elle UK, which was published June 5, the backlash on social media was instant. Much of the criticism on Twitter used the hashtag "#NotHappy," a snarky reference to the "Happy" singer's monster hit.

HOUSTON — When Leilah Abdennabi showed up for a lunch date at a popular Austin, Texas, cafe this week, she was surprised to find her friend crying.

Through tears, her friend Sirat Al-Nahi, 20, explained that while Abdennabi was parking, an elderly white man in the cafe began harassing her, suggesting Abdennabi didn't know how to drive and "should go back to Saudi Arabia."

The restaurant staff seated the man and his companion as Al-Nahi started crying.

"No one was doing or saying anything. I was like, 'Just so you guys know, we were told some very racist things at this restaurant and no one did anything because who cares about us?' And someone shouted 'Nobody,'" Abdennabi told the Los Angeles Times.

In reaction, some Muslim women in the United States have stopped wearing headscarves to avoid being targeted. Aziz said immigrants may be most likely to abandon the headscarf while those like Abdennabi and Al-Nahi, born in the United States, have deeply rooted confidence in their rights and won't sacrifice their faith.

Abdennabi, a teacher's assistant, is Palestinian-American and has worn a headscarf, or hijab, since she was 18. Though she has heard some women talk recently about taking off their headscarves, she said she won't give in.

"In the beginning it's rough, but in the end it all pays off because you can see all you learned and teach others," Garrett said.

Garrett, the Jones senior, said she plans to pursue a degree in medicine after high school because of her time in the medical-arts magnet program. The 18-year-old said the classes are challenging, but that only motivates her more.

"It's very stressful trying to learn everything at one time," said Garrett, who aspires to be an obstetrics and gynecology physician. She thought about leaving the program but "I said, 'No, I have so many people depending on me.'"

The teenager, who has learned to take blood pressure and perform CPR, said the fact that knowing that ob-gyns make a good living pushed her to endure the rigorous program. Various websites indicate that ob-gyns can earn upward of $200,000 a year and more.

Even if Garrett chose a different medical discipline, federal data suggest there are plenty of jobs available and more on the horizon. In 2014 the nation added about 65 percent more health-care jobs, or 108,000 positions, than the year before, due in part to money pumped into the economy by the Affordable Care Act, experts say.

Local hospitals are supporting efforts to employ the best and brightest students close to home.

GORDONVILLE, Pa. - The debate over U.S. healthcare reform that has gripped the nation and led to a government shutdown is of small concern in rural Pennsylvania's Amish country for a very simple reason.

While practices vary by community, most Amish fund their health care through a system that merges church aid, benefit auctions and negotiated discounts with local hospitals - promising quick cash payment in exchange for lower rates.

"The way they come together to pay for health care is amazing," said Jan Bergen, chief operating officer at Lancaster General Health. "It's a tithing. Their sense of responsibility extends beyond themselves and to the community."

It's 10 a.m. Monday inside the call center of Connecticut's new insurance exchange established under the Affordable Care Act, the federal health law. On the 21st floor of the downtown Prudential Building, about 25 operators in blue shaded cubicles are talking on telephone headsets while a dozen more callers wait on hold.

"It's controlled chaos," said David Lynch, the call center manager for the marketplace.

John Foley, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County in Florida, which received federal funding to help people navigate enrollment, said call center operators face many of the same delays as consumers because of the malfunctioning federal website.

There are 17 call centers with more than 10,000 trained representatives to assist consumers. They are managed through a $530 million one-year contract to Alexandria, Va.-based Vangent, a General Dynamics subsidiary. States such as Connecticut that have set up their own state marketplace also have their own call centers.

DALLAS — Brian Boone is practicing his silly voice. The 39-year-old soldier, who lost his lower left leg while serving in Afghanistan, looks down at Brindle, a 2-year-old Labrador-golden retriever mix — and highly trained service dog.

WASHINGTON — Contentious from its conception, President Barack Obama's health care law has survived the Supreme Court, a battle for the White House and rounds of budget brinkmanship. Now comes the ultimate test: the verdict of the American people.

Glitches are likely to pop up in the new online insurance markets. Over the weekend, several states were still struggling to get plan information to display accurately on their websites. Earlier, the federal government announced delays for small business and Spanish-language signups. A protracted government shutdown could slow needed technology fixes.

The other arm of Obamacare's coverage expansion — subsidized private insurance through the new markets — is mainly geared to uninsured people in the middle class. The administration is hoping to sign up 7 million the first year. Young, healthy adults are prime customers, since they'll help offset the cost of caring for sicker people sure to sign up once insurers can no longer reject them.

WASHINGTON — As a new school year begins, American parents should enthusiastically join first lady Michelle Obama's campaign for healthier school lunches — a campaign based on sound nutritional science with the goal of healthier, happier kids.

The first lady has made improving childhood health through better eating and more exercise her signature issue.

That's a wise choice, since childhood obesity reached epidemic proportions: In 2012, 1 in 3 American children were overweight or obese. Overweight children are at higher risk of developing a variety of ailments, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes that diminish their lives and cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year.

One component of Obama's overall program is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. It's an update to the national school lunch program, which has been subsidizing school meals since 1946. More than 30 million students now participate, but the program hadn't had a major overhaul in 15 years.

Following recommendations of the Institute of Medicine, school meals are now supposed to contain fewer calories, less fat and salt, and more fruit, vegetables and whole grains. Most parents would agree these are laudable goals.

That means a trio of reservoirs that typically are filled with 2.75 million gallons of water this time of year are only about a third full, not enough to carry the Castle through the summer.

So it doesn't make any sense to keep topping off the iconic, but leaky, outdoor Neptune Pool, which loses 3,000 to 5,000 gallons of water a day through several cracks. The pool was started in the 1920s and underwent a couple of revisions not long after.

WATFORD CITY, N.D. — The dump truck rumbled over miles of unpaved roads in the hills just east of the Montana border, past the cattle and grain bins and haystacks, before arriving at the dirt pit. Bill Gore slid his truck onto the scale, inched up in line, and made a curving gesture to the man in the front-end loader.

That was the signal to pile the dirt on high, and the loader did: Gore's five-axle truck pulled out of the pit north of Cartwright last week weighing 19,000 pounds more than its registered limit of 82,000 pounds.

"We try to run it as hard as we can," said Gore, who's been driving trucks here for four years.

Heavy trucks are the backbone of the Bakken oil fields, transporting the water, pipes and sand needed to produce more than 1 million barrels of oil a day in western North Dakota. They move oil rigs from site to site, crude to pipelines and rail terminals, and dirt and construction materials to build the new roads, homes and businesses needed to serve the exploding population of new workers.

Trucks hauling larger loads than what they were designed for pose safety concerns because extra weight lessens their braking power and increases the potential damage they could cause in a collision. On the crowded Bakken roads, truck crashes that led to severe injuries jumped twelvefold during a recent four-year period. And 100,000-pound trucks, which are common in oil-field traffic, take 25 percent longer to stop than 80,000-pound trucks, according to the Truck Safety Coalition.

In interviews that spanned water depots, truck stops and rides across oil field roads, drivers here described pressures to "haul heavy." They said jobs that pay by the ton or load, rather than by the hour, offer an incentive to overload their trucks.

"You have to go heavy just to keep up with the wells," said Jesse Scheffler, who once got a $3,000 ticket for driving a truck that was 20,000 pounds overweight. "We didn't come to North Dakota for the scenery. We're here for money."

Thanks to voice-recognition technology, Barbie was able to analyze that remark and give a relevant, conversational response: "I love New York! Don't you? Tell me, what's your favorite part about the city? The food, fashion or the sights?"

In a photo montage under the headline "10 Ways Engineering Rocks the Casbah," the Albawaba website displays construction and design improvements and video surveillance that are intended to minimize the hazards that accompany the hajj. Those include the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims attempting to walk around the mosques' interiors, pelting rocks at towers symbolizing the devil and praying on open ground exposed to temperatures that can exceed 120 degrees.

But there are significant barriers standing in Zafar's way. For one, the sport she fell in love with is amateur boxing. More significantly, she is a 15-year-old Muslim girl who is as devout as she is dedicated and she wants to wear a hijab, a head covering for Muslim women, under her boxing headgear and uniform. While it's nearly impossible for her to find opponents in her size and age group, the bigger roadblock is that international rules that govern the sport do not allow her to wear a hijab in competition. Maybe, the 10th grader thinks, boxing rules should evolve with the times.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP597881584453_1.jpg" />MINNEAPOLIS — Another group of former NHL players has joined the fight for compensation for head injuries they say they incurred while playing, while at the same time targeting the violence of the game that they believe brought about those injuries.

We understand the need for an independent investigation, and we hope that the independence and thoroughness of our investigation will bring some measure of calm to the tensions in Ferguson. In order to begin the healing process, however, we must first see an end to the acts of violence in the streets of Ferguson. Although these acts have been committed by a very small minority — and, in many cases, by individuals from outside Ferguson — they seriously undermine, rather than advance, the cause of justice. And they interrupt the deeper conversation that the legitimate demonstrators are trying to advance.

"There was this big, giant tub of chocolate in the factory" that was used in Milka candy bars, Prochnik said. "When nobody was looking I'd stick my arm in up to my elbow and then lick off the chocolate."

"Today's kids could care less about the Holocaust. It does not register with them," he said. "But kids love chocolate, and they pay attention when I tell them how that tub of chocolate helped me get through that dark chapter in human history."

His life was once as sweet as the chocolate the family produced, Prochnik tells his young audiences.

His family was on vacation when the Nazis swept into Poland. He recalled that his father received a telegram advising him that Hitler's troops were rounding up Jews and that the family should not return to Krakow. The news hit the family hard.

"You have your favorite things at your home and you know you're never going back there," Prochnik tells youngsters. The family stayed with relatives in Chelm, Poland, but the good life was clearly over. "We were sleeping on straw pallets. Getting used to that was very hard," he explains.

When the Nazis began hunting down Jews in Chelm, family members used jewelry they had with them to pay smugglers to sneak them by horse-drawn hay cart and by boat into neighboring Lithuania. There they found themselves hiding in barns and squalid farm huts.

"We would stay in peasants' quarters with goats and pigs in the room," he said. "We'd been pampered in Krakow. It was like coming from Beverly Hills and finding yourself in a poor peasant's house in Mexico, sleeping on the floor."

One of Prochnik's older cousins obtained a travel visa to allow the family to leave Lithuania for Russia and then on to Canada. But some of his Jewish school friends in Lithuania did not receive travel papers. Young Leon began having nightmares in which he was escaping the Nazis in a big vat of chocolate as his friends futilely tried to get in.

Another relative who had previously escaped to the West financed the family's Trans-Siberian Railway trip across Russia and a sea voyage from Vladivostok to Vancouver, Canada. After a short stay, the family moved to New York City and established a new chocolate business.

His family was never able to return to their Krakow home or the chocolate factory — which was the Swiss-based Suchard brand's Polish franchisee. German officials "claimed they had bought them from us" and even had fake bills of sale drawn up, Prochnik said.

Once in New York City, the now-7-year-old was reassured by his parents that they were all safe. "I was no longer physically looking over my shoulder," he said. "But it took a couple of years in the United States before I stopped being afraid of the dark."

As an adult, Prochnik became a writer, film editor and director as well as a leader of consciousness-raising workshops. He first talked about his childhood experience with the Holocaust when his wife, Mia, invited him to speak to a class she was teaching at a Los Angeles elementary school. After that, the Museum of Tolerance asked him to speak to visitors there. So far, about 1,000 children have heard about his escape from the Nazis.

Speaking one recent morning to a group of 67 Fillmore middle school and high school students touring the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust, Prochnik explained that his wife, who is Catholic, persuaded him to return in 2003 to Krakow for a visit. The family's chocolate factory was gone, but Prochnik was invited into the family's former mansion, he told the youngsters.

Jesus Mendoza, a 17-year-old senior at Fillmore High in Ventura County, said he could relate to Prochnik's past because his immigrant family gave up a life in Mexico to come to this country for educational opportunities. Jesus' father has a third-grade education; his mother finished second grade, he said.

"I've never heard anyone who actually went through what people like my parents have," Jesus said. "I think people were shocked by the reality. For him the chocolate tub symbolized safety and hope — it made him feel comfortable."

Ninth-grader Aiyanna Pillado, 13, concurred.

"The chocolate tub was his happy place," she said.

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — When the thought of running for homecoming queen first swept through Cassidy Campbell's mind last year, she pushed the impulse aside. It would just be a joke, she told herself.

On Friday, at Marina High's homecoming pep rally, the field of 10 homecoming queen candidates was thinned to five—Cassidy among them.

At halftime, school district spokesman Tom Delapp said, the five finalists were called up and balloons were released from a box to announce the winner—white for the princesses and bright yellow and blue for the queen.

"She was stunned. She kind of broke down on the podium," Delapp said of Cassidy. "She was shocked. She cried a lot."

WASHINGTON — Chances are you won't see one of the nation's fastest-growing homeless populations camped out on a park bench or queuing up at a local shelter. One in 30 of American children is homeless — an all-time high of 2.5 million, according to a new report by the National Center on Family Homelessness (NCFH). But these kids are often invisible, crashing with their families on friends' couches, sleeping in all-night diners or hopping from motel to motel from week to week.

Ten-year-old Kaylie Hegwood and her brother Tyler, 12, are hungry – very hungry. Not because they just finished a game of soccer or forgot to eat breakfast. Kaylie and Tyler are hungry because most of the time their mom cannot afford to buy them food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

"There's good days and bad days," Tyler told Jezza Neumann, the director of the PBS documentary "Poor Kids." "Sometimes when we have cereal, we don't have milk. We have to eat it dry. Sometimes we don't have cereal and we have milk. It's often, like, switch and swap. Sometimes, like, when I switch the channel and there's a cooking show on, I get a little more hungry and I want to vanish into the screen and start eating the food."

Kaylie and Tyler live with their mother, Barbara, in Iowa. Even though Barbara is employed, she has very little money left for groceries after paying the rent. Kaylie and Tyler try to help their mother by both collecting empty cans to recycle and by mowing lawns. Kaylie and Tyler do not attend school because they do not have a permanent home. They move too frequently to register at a school. Currently they are living in a motel. They are homeless.

Todd first approached homeless people in April, asking whether they wanted new signs. Some refused, but others acquiesced and Todd got to work. He finished about 20 signs in two months and said the complexity of the lettering meant one sign took anywhere from five to 10 hours to complete. He started a blog called "The Urban Type Experiment" documenting his experience making the signs, which quickly went viral.

Classes at 8 a.m. most days, finish up around noon, then on to work. His recent life as a student at Kennesaw State University was far from perfect, but it was temporarily manageable. And then his car's transmission failed.

During the 2012-2013 academic year, more than 58,150 college applicants nationwide identified themselves on federal financial forms as homeless. That was an increase from the previous year's 53,705, according to information obtained by the National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth. That figure is likely understated because some students living on friends' couches, for example, don't consider themselves homeless, and some others are too embarrassed to identify themselves that way, said Barbara Duffield, NAEHCY's executive director.

In one of the most striking findings, the number of tents, makeshift encampments and vehicles occupied by homeless people soared 85 percent, to 9,535, according to biennial figures from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.

Hookah bars are a relaxed gathering place for customers to socialize as they smoke tobacco through water pipes. It's a hot trend among young adults. Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. students smoked hookah in the last year, according to a study published in the journal Pediatrics. About 10 businesses sell hookah within a 5-mile radius of the University of Texas at Dallas.

"There is no reason to believe that a water pipe is less dangerous than a cigarette," says Dr. Thomas Eissenberg, a Virginia Commonwealth University professor who has conducted numerous studies on water pipe smoking. "In fact, depending on some of the toxins, there is reason to believe it is more dangerous."

"The problem is, if you go into a water pipe bar and look at the pipe you are being served, there is nothing on that pipe or on the tobacco or in that charcoal that tells you it's dangerous," Eissenberg says. "I have gotten this outlook from kids: 'It doesn't say it's dangerous, so it must be safe.'"

Hookah smoke is known to contain higher levels of lead, nickel and arsenic, 36 times more tar and 15 times more carbon monoxide than cigarettes, research in the Journal of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention shows.

This is because smoking a hookah requires taking harder and longer drags, increasing the levels of inhaled carcinogens and nicotine in the lungs.

WASHINGTON - Wild horses are being offered for auction this weekend in Fort Worth, Texas, as part of a desperate effort by a federal government that cannot figure out what to do with them. These horses are descended from the steeds of Spanish explorers, Native Americans, U.S. cavalry and ranch strays.

CHICAGO — The four horses hadn't been visited in weeks. There was no water in their buckets, no hay in their stalsl. All of the animals looked dangerously thin.

The horses' caregiver apparently had stopped showing up. So even though the horses were not hers, Joyce Benes, the owner of an Oswego stable, fed them her own hay. But with hay prices as much as five times higher than usual because of last year's drought, she couldn't afford to do so indefinitely, she said.

Desperate, Benes called the Illinois Department of Agriculture in January for help, then waited, she said. And waited.

Horse rescue organizations such as Pecho's have picked up abandoned horses on the side of the road and roaming through suburban neighborhoods. Their shelters are crowded to capacity with sometimes three times as many horses as usual, and operators have had to turn away new ones, they said.

In 2002, the Bureau of Animal Health and Welfare had 32 employees compared with 12 now. The bureau's budget was slashed from $7 million to $4.6 million in the same time period, Squibb said.

The overheated debate between the federal government and animal advocates over the removal of wild mustangs from the Western range ticked a few degrees higher after the Bureau of Land Management announced plans to take fewer horses from the land this summer.

Animal advocates say 1,300 horses is still too many, and they question the BLM's rationale for the removals.

"The BLM is galloping ahead with rounding up more wild horses, despite the high cost to taxpayers and animals as well as the findings of an independent scientific review, which recommends against continued roundups," said coalition spokeswoman Suzanne Roy. "The agency still has not gotten the message that the removal of wild horses from our Western public lands is inhumane, unsustainable, unscientific, and must come to an end."

As with most things in nature, one thing is always connected to another. The shortage of crabs has led to fewer eggs and a major decline in shorebirds that rely on the eggs for food.

Now, with the crabs' prime mating season in Florida underway, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is trying enlist help from the public, much in the way it has recruited volunteers to count sea turtles. By reporting on the crabs' night-time trysts, researchers hope to understand not just their habits, but calculate their numbers.

"It's a really cool creature," said Tiffany Black, a state biologist at the Sen. George Kirkpatrick Marine Lab in Cedar Key. "It helps people. But it's one of these things that's maligned and overlooked, and the more information the better."

Each year, the female crab can lay up to 90,000 eggs, creating a feast for the Red Knot. But without the eggs, as a 12-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey found in 2011, the birds are unable to make the second leg of their journey to their Arctic mating grounds. Since the 1990s, their numbers have fallen by 75 percent.

The crabs spawn year-round in Florida, although their prime season occurs between March and May.

Clearly, horticulture — once a priority, if not an obsession, for generations of Americans — is in trouble. The letter warns that if something isn't done soon to boost the ranks of plant scientists, breeders, students, and others in the field, horticulture could become a lost art and a forgotten science.

By the book, horticulture is the art and science of growing fruits, vegetables, flowers, and ornamental plants.

More often, in the public mind, "it's a guy with a pickup truck and a lawn mower, a low-paying job requiring manual labor and no college degree," said Mary H. Meyer, horticultural science professor at the University of Minnesota and, as president of the American Society for Horticultural Science, a critical force in the campaign.

Horticulturists in both countries say the crisis has been building for decades, greatly influenced by the globalization of the food and flower trades, the population shift from farm to city, and the loss of personal connection to the land.

"When do most people get interested in plants now?" asked Richard Marini, head of Pennsylvania State University's plant science department. "Usually, when they buy a house, and by then, they're out of college."

In 2001, he moved to South Carolina and began working as a bank trust officer. At home, he made salsas and hot sauces from peppers he grew in his yard. That helped Currie woo and wed his wife, who loves salsa. She later persuaded him to sell his salsas rather than give them away to a growing number of friends and neighbors.

Among the more popular sauces: Edible Lava, Ben's Smokin' Hot Razz Booty, I Dare You Stupit. Some products are made from the Reaper, whose off-label uses include "settling old scores," Currie said.

Timothy Cade had only owned his hoverboard for three days when it exploded beneath him.

"Hoverboard is on fire," he says in a video taken right after he jumped off the burning piece of equipment. "What is going on dude?"

The bow-shaped board, which doesn't really "hover" but is instead more akin to a cross between a skateboard and a Segway, flamed and popped angrily.

His mother ran out with a box of baking soda. Though baking soda is recommended for extinguishing grease fires, it didn't help the hoverboard situation. The toy hissed and boomed, then the battery pack went shooting out of it. Flames engulfed the board.

Lithium ion battery explosions are by no means unique to hoverboards. They've been sparking fires since the only person who had ever ridden one was Marty McFly (setting aside for the moment that he pretty much still is). A few of Tesla's electric cars have been incinerated by them, iPods have gone up in flames. Awareness of the problem is broad enough that one popular - if so far unfounded - explanation for the disappearance of missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 is that a shipment of lithium ion batteries caught fire in the plane's cargo hold.

But batteries in hoverboards face problems that an iPod doesn't. For one thing, no one is standing on iPods while smashing into walls at high speeds. The wear and tear and feats of bro-iness to which hoverboards are subjected makes their batteries more vulnerable to damage.

Since there are no rules on how hoverboards must be made, it's easy for manufacturers to get away with substandard products, he said.

Many people are quick to blame teachers for the shortcomings of America's schools. And the shortcomings should be obvious.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown consistently that many students, in the fields of U.S. history and government, among others, are not even mastering the basics

For example, the most recent NAEP U.S. history exam, in 2010, found just 12 percent of all U.S. high school seniors scoring at or above the "proficient" level, which the Institute of Education Sciences describes as the level representing "solid academic performance to which all students … should aspire."

To successfully teach U.S. history and government, so students understand and appreciate the principles that define our American character, teachers need to rely less on textbooks and more on the writings and thinking of those who shaped our country.

> 



However, stuffing more American history and civics classes into already crowded high school curricula is exactly the wrong way to accomplish that worthwhile mission.

By all means we should recognize ours flaws at home and costly mistakes abroad. But we should also recognize that our founders were wise — exceptionally well-read and learned even by present day standards.

The latest figures released in mid-December by the Education Department showed wide disparities in graduation rates according to where students live. Leading the way was Iowa, with a graduation rate of nearly 91 percent. The District of Columbia had the lowest rate, 61 percent.

Mike Huckabee, the folksy former governor, preacher and television host, entered the 2016 presidential race on Tuesday with a base of loyal supporters from his prior White House run, but he faces a cast of potential rivals that is larger and stronger than in 2008.

Others eyeing the White House who appeal to evangelicals include former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the victor of the Iowa caucuses in 2012. Paul is also courting religious voters.

Hungarian lawmakers on Tuesday passed a bill that will ban most shopping on Sundays, casting the move as insurance that families will have more time together.

CHAMELA, Mexico — Just a day after menacing Mexico as one of history's strongest storms, Hurricane Patricia left surprisingly little damage in its wake Saturday and quickly dissipated into a low-pressure system that posed little threat beyond heavy rain.

In Manzanillo, high winds and waves blew out windows and damaged some buildings. Trees and utility poles were toppled. An enraged sea battered the Hotel Barra de Navidad in a nearby town, scooping sand away from the foundations.

PALM BEACH, Fla. — Early one Saturday in August 1992, South Floridians discovered they had 48 hours to brace for, or flee, the newly formed Andrew, which would become one of the nation's most infamous hurricanes.

Oklahomans got all of 16 minutes before Monday's tornado. And that was more time than most past twisters have allowed.

In the grim parlor game of "choose your poison," Floridians debate with their tornado-weary friends and family about which disaster they'd rather have.

Hurricanes have a lot of cons: sustained, devastating winds, vicious storm surges and damage over a wider area. But "they're the one threat we can see coming," said Craig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency who was Florida's emergency manager during 2004's spate of storms.

That advantage makes failing to prepare inexcusable, Fugate told the National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans in March. And yet studies have found — even with the start of hurricane season looming June 1 — that as many as two in three Florida residents say they have no plan for what they will do if a tropical system threatens.

Preparation helped only a little for Moore, Oklahoma, on Monday. According to a preliminary National Weather Service summary, Monday's tornado was a top-end EF5, with top winds of 200 to 210 miles per hour (mph), and was 1.3 miles wide. It was tracked on the ground for 50 minutes — an eternity for a tornado — and its damage zone is more than 17 miles wide.

Oklahoma's insurance commissioner has said damages could top those from 2012's Joplin, Missouri, tornado, which was about $2 billion.

Tornadoes cover a smaller track — Monday's twister traveled 17 miles — than hurricanes, and their lifespans are measured in minutes. A tornado of EF2 or more — winds of 111 mph to 165 mph — can destroy a structure in four seconds. But only one in four tornadoes have wind speeds at 110 mph or greater, the threshold of a major hurricane.

Andrew, one of only three Category 5 storms to strike the U.S. mainland, had top sustained winds of 165 mph. As many as 500,000 people felt hurricane-force winds. Because people took precautions, only 15 died in South Florida.

"Understanding it under these extended regimes can open up windows to large astrophysical bodies," Dalladay-Simpson said, "such as the interiors of the hydrogen-rich Jovian planets such as Jupiter."

To get at this question, Dalladay-Simpson and colleagues took hydrogen molecules and crushed them between two anvils made of diamond, keeping the temperature a balmy 80 degrees Fahrenheit but raising the pressure to 325 gigapascals, equivalent to 3.21 million Earth atmospheres.

The scientists found that at these pressures, the structure of the material started to change in significant ways. Though it's hard to say what a chunk of hydrogen in this state would look like, it might resemble layers of molecular hydrogen interspersed with layers of atomic hydrogen. With that in mind, it could well be the precursor to the long-theorized solid metallic state, in which all molecular bonds are broken down.

The next step is to ratchet the pressure up by a few tens of gigapascals to see if they can actually reach the predicted metallic state – which shouldn't be too hard, "considering we reached 400 GPa," Dalladay-Simpson said.

Solid metallic hydrogen might exhibit such far-out properties as superfluidity and superconductivity – and so, if it were ever able to be mass produced, it could have game-changing technological implications, he added.

That's true of many, many other places, too. And now, in a new study in Nature Climate Change, Princeton's Ning Lin and MIT's Kerry Emanuel demonstrate that when it comes to three global cities in particular — Tampa, Florida; Cairns, Australia; and Dubai, United Arab Emirates — there could come a storm that is much worse than anything in recent memory (or in any memory).

Granted, these theoretical storms are also highly unlikely to occur — in some cases, they are 1-in-10,000-year events, or even rarer. The researchers refer to these possible storms as "gray swans," riffing on the concept of a "black swan" event, an unpredictable catastrophe, or highly impactful event. A "gray swan," by contrast, can indeed be predicted, even if it is extremely rare.

Now that angler is apt to be sitting in his — or her — shirtsleeves in an insulated fishing shelter, twitching a glow-in-the-dark jig, a propane heater glowing in one corner, a flasher depth-finder purring next to a power-augered hole. A string of LED lights might brighten the shelter, and the angler is apt to be texting a friend while watching the flasher indicate an incoming fish.

An activity that once was an exercise in suffering and endurance has become downright civilized. Ice fishing's rise in popularity has paralleled innovations in ice-fishing gear, retailers say. Lots of ice-fishing shelters are now made with integrated sled bases. The top folds into the sled, along with bait buckets, rods, tackle and heaters. The power auger, fueled by gas or propane or battery power, rides in the truck or on the snow machine.

Ice fishing retailers say the winter fishing season now rivals the summer season, which is saying something in a fish-crazy state like Minnesota.

SOCHI, Russia — Julia Lipnitskaia, all 5-foot-2 of her, stepped onto the Olympic ice in a red coat Sunday to skate to music from the movie Schindler's List. Just like the girl in the red coat in the predominantly black-and-white film, the 15-year-old Russian figure skater captured the eye and leaped out from her competition with unparalleled artistry, flexibility and blurring spins.

When the music stopped, and she had landed the last of her 10 jumps, a mesmerized partisan crowd that included Russian president Vladimir Putin was on its feet applauding, whistling, and chanting, 'Yu-li-a! Yu-li-a!' and "Russ-ee-ya! Russ-ee-ya!''

"One of the big take-aways is the power of individuals who are so tightly connected to a cause can really make a difference," Munk said. "I'm pretty sure that if any company or any nonprofit had all of the public relations dollars in the world to come up with a campaign, we never would've seen this kind of success."

Lucretia Gilbert, executive director of the Pink Agenda, which raises money for breast cancer research and awareness, believes it will encourage other nonprofits to get creative on social media.

"We should not forget the people who have been deported," she said. Monday's action quickly grew in number as about 30 others spontaneously joined the petitioners at the U.S. border, taking activists by surprise. Organized by the National Immigrant Youth Alliance, the immigrants planned to ask for humanitarian parole, which would allow them into the country, or, failing that, asylum.

He was 14 when he crossed the border from Mexico and has worked in the fields ever since. He has never gone to school and cannot read or write in any language.

Angela Vasquez, a community college student who has been blind since birth, was hoping to get a fee waiver because of her disability. Elvira Vasquez, who dropped out of high school after her son was born, would use GED classes to qualify for deferred action. The sisters were surprised when Pinto told them that their brother Benito, with his lack of formal education, might also qualify. By mid-May, Benito Vasquez's better-educated sisters were well on their way to work permits and driver's licenses. And his wife, Maria, was inspired to get her GED.

Benito's path is more uncertain. He has yet to register at the adult school. It is hard to find the time for classes after a 10-hour workday.

Moments earlier, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials had released her and the other members of the Dream 9 from Eloy Detention Center in Arizona, allowing them to return to their American communities until they can argue their case in court. They take their name from the Dream Act, which would provide a path to legalization for immigrants like them who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

ARLINGTON, Va. — Teacher Michael Coughlin sometimes learns about his students' harrowing trips across the border alone and what they left behind from the essays they write. Other times, they'll mention a court date or ask for help finding an immigration attorney.

ARRIAGA, Mexico — Wilson Coxaj, looking braver than his 16 years might merit, left his village in Guatemala's highlands earlier this month and is making his way to the United States. It is a perilous journey.

If he's successful, he'll join what U.S. officials are calling "the surge" — the dramatic increase in [child migrants](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Central+american+emigration) flooding across the U.S. border, creating what President Barack Obama calls an "urgent humanitarian situation."

"What has increased are children aged 10 to 12 who are traveling with their mothers," said Rene Vigne, a Frenchman who works at the Hermanos en el Camino (Brothers on the Path) shelter in Ixtepec, Mexico.

"It's not a temporary situation," said Lynn Tramonte, the deputy director of America's Voice, which focuses on changing immigration policy. "It might be a seasonal job, but we're going to keep having grapes that need to be picked and cows that need to be milked, and immigrants are coming to do that sort of labor."

While the rest of the nation is gorging on Thanksgiving meals, the immigration activist and two other fasters will be in a heated tent on the National Mall at the foot of the Capitol.

WASHINGTON — The Senate Thursday voted 68-32 to overhaul the nation's immigration system, an ambitious plan that creates a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants while requiring tough new steps to secure the nation's borders.

Other Republicans had a different take. They tend to represent states with large and growing Hispanic populations, and they were bowing to political reality. They saw their presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, win only about one-fourth of the Hispanic vote last year and are concerned that constituency is slipping away.

WASHINGTON — Slightly more fourth-graders nationwide are reading proficiently compared with a decade ago, but only a third of them are now reading well, according to a new report. The study also found the reading skills gap between children from lower-income and higher-income families has grown, and proficiency varies considerably across states.

Students in all but six states have improved reading proficiency, according to the report by the Annie E. Casey Foundation, which used reading scores from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation's Report Card, to compare reading skills of fourth-graders in 2013 and 2003.

But Speer warned that the numbers also described a more complex picture, with some states that fared well on average showing among the highest disparities in reading between students from lower-income and higher-income families.

Sports participation among lower-income students decreased by 10 percent compared to the May 2012 poll on the same subject. Even among parents in higher-income households, nearly 1 in 10 parents said their child had decreased sports participation because of cost – twice as high as reported in 2012.

MUMBAI, India — The voice that answers the number posted on the online ad is polished, confident: No one will suspect anything, he says. The gadget has never failed.

A college senior, he sounds younger on the phone but assures the caller that he speaks from experience. He gives his name as Anil and quotes his price: about $40. Minutes later he texts, offering a 6 percent discount.

That's the price to cheat on one of India's all-important tests, a pressure-packed exercise that holds the key to the country's most coveted colleges, universities and postgraduate programs.

Anil, a medical student in southern India who asked that his full name be withheld, was selling a tiny wireless earpiece, scarcely bigger than the head of a pin. The earpiece receives a signal from a cellphone via a transmitter. During exams, Anil conceals the transmitter under a loose-fitting shirt, texts pictures of the test questions to a friend at home and receives answers over the phone.

"There's no way anyone can even make out you using the device," says Anil, who found the earpieces in the United States and imports them in bulk, selling three or four a week on eBay to high school and college students. "I've never had any problems. You just need to have some confidence and a good friend who can help you out during the exams."

In India's increasingly meritocratic system, good scores in the nationwide tests for 10th- and 12th-graders — known as board exams — determine not only admission to the best schools but also to the most sought-after disciplines, such as engineering and medicine. Likewise, undergraduates compete for limited spaces in elite postgraduate programs. Parental pressure can be overwhelming, students say.

Education officials say they are tackling the problem, but for every comical-sounding contraption like the one Anil was selling, more extreme examples routinely surface in the Indian news media once exam season begins each February.

At a school in Allahabad, in northern India, members of an inspection team were attacked with "crude bombs" last month after catching two students cheating, according to news reports.

At a test center in northern India's Bareilly district, state-appointed inspectors making a surprise visit last month found school staff members writing answers to a Hindi exam on the blackboard. When the inspectors arrived, the staff members tried to throw the evidence out the window.

For rule-breakers, low-tech methods remain popular. Teachers say that hiding cheat sheets in socks, copying neighbors' answers and scribbling notes on walls are the most common tactics. Test papers routinely are leaked as well, often by low-level school employees who sell them for the equivalent of a few dollars, and sometimes by teachers or administrators whose professional standing rises if students perform well.

Many of the workers are not yet teenagers, and they fill the dimly lit corridors of the textile mills and warehouses of this industrial city in western India. Despite a law requiring every child younger than 14 to be in school full time, millions of Indian boys and girls still hold jobs, including more than 50,000 in Surat alone, according to estimates from human rights groups.

In Surat, a fast-growing city of 4.6 million, textile bosses routinely tell labor inspectors that the boys embroidering saris, folding garments and assembling boxes are relatives.

"A lot of farmers barely know they're growing coffee," said Ross, a 34-year-old former advertising man who launched his company in 2012. "To them it's just another crop they sell to the West."

He contacted farmers, persuaded them to sell him beans directly and began roasting them at home. In January 2013, he launched Blue Tokai, which sold 7 tons of coffee across India in its first year, each brown paper package printed with the name of the farm that produced the beans.

NEW DELHI — The Jariwal household could barely contain its joy on a recent weekday afternoon as family members prepared for their oldest daughter's wedding: The invitations had been delivered, a venue chosen, hotel reservations made.

SHANI SHINGANAPUR, India — Nanasahib Bankar, a prosperous farmer and entrepreneur in this small temple town, worries about a lot of things: sugar cane prices, the health of his cattle, the success of his son's new hotel.

Legend has it that Shani, the Hindu deity to whom the local temple is dedicated, watches over Shani Shinganapur, a town of about 15,000 in western India, preventing crime and punishing thieves.

Against one of those white walls a grizzled old man with a breathing tube in his nose lies moaning on a stretcher. Nearby, clutching a sheaf of prescriptions, the father of a sick college student tries to catch the attention of one of Udwadia's assisting physicians. Several families have traveled thousands of kilometers to be here. Many of these patients, like 19-year-old Nisha, an engineering student from the central state of Madhya Pradesh, have tuberculosis (TB). Nisha, who asked that her real name be withheld, has been treated for lung problems for more than a year, only to learn that inaccurate diagnoses and prescription errors have supercharged the disease rather than curing it. "My doctors kept on changing the drugs," says Nisha. Dressed in jeans and a floral-print blouse and black Buddy Holly–style horn-rimmed glasses, she speaks in a bright, optimistic voice, although her battle with TB has left her anorexic-thin.

For an ordinary infection, the WHO-mandated treatment includes lengthy treatment with a cocktail of antibiotics: a two-month course of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol followed by a four-month regimen of isoniazid and rifampicin alone. If the patient fails to complete the treatment or the TB bacilli in the patient's system is already immune to one of those antibiotics, however, then some of the germs will survive, adapt and grow stronger. Some of the hardier organisms can survive to pass on drug-resistant traits to their progeny, and those traits then spread to a wider group of descendants. That means it's crucial to kill off the entire population with the first course of treatment and hunt down and kill off any resistors.

In December 2011 Udwadia decided that he had seen enough. The laboratory at Hinduja — one of the few Indian labs equipped to perform drug-susceptibility testing — identified a fourth patient infected with TB that was impervious to all 12 of the first-line, second-line and last-resort drugs that the hospital had at its disposal. He dashed off a two-page note to the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, declaring an outbreak of what he called "totally drug-resistant TB."

The public outcry forced the government into action. It dramatically boosted the budget for the national tuberculosis control program and increased hospital and outreach staff fourfold. Authorities stopped using older, error-prone blood tests, and began a transition to molecular testing with new GeneXpert machines that identify genetic markers of resistant strains. Though still in short supply, the machines drastically reduced false positives and allowed doctors to detect resistance to first-line drugs within two hours, rather than weeks. Where they've been implemented, the machines produce a fivefold increase in detection of rifampicin resistance, for instance, according to the largest Indian study to date. Cases that the machine flags as drug-resistant are referred to the district TB officer, and a committee of specialists decides on a treatment regime. "I don't think the push would have been sustainable if not for Zarir [Udwadia]'s reports in the newspapers," Mistry says. "It forced people to come to terms with what was really happening in the city."

"Would you like me to clean your ear?" he asks.

Hundreds gathered along U.S. Highway 12 on Monday and Tuesday and formed a human blockade in an attempt to stop a controversial megaload of equipment bound for the oil tar sands of Alberta, Canada — a load reportedly weighing about 644,000 pounds and stretching over 200 feet. They intended on continuing their protests Wednesday and Thursday nights.

The picturesque terrain is home to white-tail deer, cougars, black bears and mountain goats, with rivers teeming with salmon and trout.

"Everything is in there," said Silas Whitman, chairman of the Nez Perce tribal executive committee and among those arrested. "Yet they want to make it an industrial corridor." By allowing the loads, he said, the tribe would "be a party to the destruction to those areas."

The load this week has raised questions about who has the authority to approve such convoys. Omega Morgan, the Oregon contractor transporting a General Electric water evaporator, said it was operating under an oversized load permit approved by the Idaho Department of Transportation.

The company said it followed state-ordered guidelines that include traveling at night, not holding up traffic for longer than 15 minutes and not making any alterations to the roadways or surrounding vegetation.

But the U.S. Forest Service claims to have authority in cases in which the loads travel through protected lands. It has voiced opposition, saying in a statement that it disagreed with the state permit through the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests until a study could be completed in the coming months.

Before the protests, Whitman said tribal leaders told police they understood officers would have to carry out their duty, even if it led to arrests.

On Monday, Whitman was the first to be cuffed. He was with his 10-year-old granddaughter. He told her to go back behind the barricade as he was carried off, to be taken to jail. "You have to stay here," he said he told her. "You can't go with me."
Pence defended the measure as a vehicle to protect religious liberty but said he has been meeting with lawmakers "around the clock" to address concerns that it would allow businesses to deny services to gay customers.

The governor said he does not believe "for a minute" that lawmakers intended "to create a license to discriminate."

Opponents of the bill hoped to target Hutchinson's promise to be a "jobs governor" made during his successful bid last year for the state's top office. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, has run ads in Silicon Valley aimed at the same technology firms Hutchinson has said he wants to lure to Arkansas.

Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post over the weekend opposing the Arkansas and Indiana measures, while retail giant Wal-Mart has said the proposal sends the wrong message about its home state. Little Rock-based data services company Acxiom also urged Hutchinson to veto the bill, saying the measure would enable discrimination and open the state up to ridicule.

SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, Calif. — Archaeologist Torben Rick watched with frustration as pounding surf clawed at one of North America's oldest homesteads, a massive heap of village foundations, cutting tools, beads and kitchen discards left behind over the last 13,000 years.

LOS ANGELES—Gears may seem like a purely human invention. And yet the basic interlocking mechanism found inside grandfather clocks and car steering systems has now turned up in the remarkably powerful legs of young planthopper insects.

That method of locomotion can be tricky. If one leg fires first, the planthopper will end up spinning, like a one-armed breast-stroke swimmer.

MILWAUKEE — The electric barrier on the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that is considered the last line of defense to stop an Asian carp invasion of Lake Michigan has a problem: Fish can swim through it.

States the report: "Initial findings indicate that vessel-induced residual flows can trap fish and transport them beyond the electrical barriers, and that certain barge configurations may impact barrier electric field strength. Additionally, the preliminary (sonar camera) findings identified the potential for small fish (between 2-4 inches in length) to pass the barrier array in large groups, or schools."

GALVESTON, Texas — It sounds like something from a horror film: A beautiful, feathery-looking species of fish with venomous spines and a voracious appetite sweeps into the Gulf of Mexico, gobbling up everything in its path.

In recent months, news has been spreading of lionfish, a maroon-and-white striped native of the South Pacific that first showed up off the coast of southern Florida in 1985. Most likely, someone dumped a few out of a home fish tank. With a reproduction rate that would put rabbits to shame and no predators to slow its march, the fish swept up the Eastern seaboard and down to the Bahamas and beyond, where it is now more common than in its home waters.

Lionfish can eat anything that fits into their mouth, even fish half their own size. They eat commercially important species, such as snapper and grouper, and the fish that those species eat, too. They're eating so much, in fact, that scientists say some are suffering from a typically human problem — obesity. "We're finding them with copious amount of fat — white, blubbery fat," Johnston says.

In the Gulf, lionfish are eating herbivores like damselfish and wrasse — "the lawnmowers of the reef," Johnston calls them — that keep the reef clean. "When you take the reef fish away, there's not a lot of other things left to eat algae," she says. That creates a phase shift from a coral-dominated habitat to an algae-dominated one. "When you take fish away, coral gets smothered, the reef dies, and we lose larger fish. It's a snowball effect of negativity."

To get around a snail's armor, the worm latches onto the shell's opening, then spits its stomach out through the mouth on its belly. An acidic goo from the stomach dissolves the snail's flesh so the worm can re-swallow both stomach and prey. Time for dessert.

SAN FRANCISCO — Happily hunched over his iPad, Britain's most celebrated living artist David Hockney is pioneering in the art world again, turning his index finger into a paintbrush that he uses to swipe across a touch screen to create vibrant landscapes, colorful forests and richly layered scenes.

"It's a very new medium," said Hockney. So new, in fact, he wasn't sure what he was creating until he began printing his digital images a few years ago. "I was pretty amazed by them actually," he said, laughing. "I'm still amazed."

A new exhibit of Hockney's work, including about 150 iPad images, opened Saturday in the de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, just a short trip for Silicon Valley techies who created both the hardware and software for this 21st-century reinvention of finger-painting.

The show is billed as the museum's largest ever, filling two floors of the de Young with a survey of works from 1999 to the present, mostly landscapes and portraits in an array of mediums: watercolor, charcoal and even video. But on a recent preview day, it was the iPad pieces, especially the 12-foot high majestic views of Yosemite National Park that drew gasps.

Hatch said a "digital turn" in the art world began about 25 years ago, as the Internet gained popularity, and he said today most artists have adapted to using a device in some way as they create art.

Still, many ordinary Iranians are openly skeptical that things will get much better — or just not sure what all the fuss is about.

There are signs that Rouhani "is somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States in a way that we haven't seen in the past," Obama said in an interview on Telemundo. "So we should test it."

Analysts say Obama must be careful not to look too eager to make a deal. That would undermine his negotiating leverage and alienate influential Iran hawks in Congress, as well as the Israelis, who are counting on the United States to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear bomb.

Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Friday that U.S. officials weren't falling for pretty promises from the new Iranian leadership. "Their words have to be followed by action," he said.

And secondly, he is not a mercenary. If U.S. Soccer had pursued him with the same as fervor as Iran's national team, he would have been just as happy to stay home. But he was never asked to make that choice.

Occasionally breaking into sobs, the cleric exhorted members of the congregation to make their pleas both to the Creator and to Imam Hussein, a revered figure in Shiite Muslim tradition. The water shortages afflicting Iran, the ayatollah suggested, could be a heavenly nudge aimed at getting sluggish believers to pay a little more attention to matters of the spirit.

Concern is mounting about dwindling water supplies across Iran, from the densely populated, smog-ridden capital and its parched suburbs to provincial towns and cities to far-flung corners of the nation, much of which is desert. Lakes and rivers have been drying up, reservoirs are at historic lows and there have been water supply cuts in some areas. The annual snow-melt from the mountains is on the decline.

"Tehran's dams only have water for a few more days, and this means that people must take serious measures," the vice president warned. "Those who use water beyond normal amounts are hurting those who abide by appropriate levels of consumption."

"This whole 'Death to USA' business is serving the interests of those who make a lucrative living as middlemen breaking the sanctions," said Alireza Qajar, 36, a plastics importer who was washing down pancakes with French-roast coffee at a cafe.

BAGHDAD — Ann Khalid did not feel well but she insisted on dancing a brief scene from Tchaikovsky's "Swan Lake" with her classmates. The 12-year-old is determined to one day have a career dancing and teaching ballet, not an easy path in a country torn for years by conflict.

The city plunged deeper into chaos after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The school was looted days after Saddam Hussein's ouster. Later it was partially burned during a rampage by disgruntled Saddam-era officers.

A few steps from the statue, dozens lined up to enter the open-air courtyard of a cultural center where writers gather weekly to share their work. Up the street, the Shabandar Cafe was packed with patrons — young and old, mostly male but a few female — sharing their latest finds over chai tea and water pipes. They sat sipping and smoking in small wooden booths beneath walls papered with black and white photographs of Iraqi intellectuals.

Among the readers on hand was Mohammed Baghdadi, 32, a manager at the Ministry of Trade. Baghdadi, wearing a pressed sweater and leather shoes, said he favors writers like the late Iraqi sociologist Ali Wardi and American thriller writer Dan Brown. He has read every book Brown has written except the seemingly elusive "Digital Fortress."

"When you see all these people coming, you don't feel you're in danger. Where there's a culture of reading, there won't be war," said filmmaker Salaam Musa, 30, considering the crowd from behind mirrored sunglasses and a fur-trim coat, before taking a call on his smartphone.

"I saw this wave of young people who were going, many of my friends going, and I saw this as a chance," said Falah, who hopes to make it to Germany. "I'm in a better position than many people, but I want to make a better future for my family."

BAGHDAD — When Islamic State group militants invaded the Central Library of Mosul earlier this month, they were on a mission to destroy a familiar enemy: other people's ideas.

But this time, the Islamic State group has made the penalty for such actions death. Presumed destroyed are the Central Library's collection of Iraqi newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire and book collections contributed by around 100 of Mosul's establishment families.

Days after the Central Library's ransacking, militants broke into University of Mosul's library. They made a bonfire out of hundreds of books on science and culture, destroying them in front of students.

Shouting men scrambled Sunday to reach pots of rice, meat and chicken stew in this dusty, hot encampment some 60 miles (100 kilometers) from the northern city of Irbil, the capital of Iraq's self-ruled Kurdish region. The chaotic scene underscored the fearful insecurity of displaced Iraqis as they begin Ramadan in a nation gripped by unrest and bitterly divided along sectarian lines.

WASHINGTON — Ahmed Abdulateef's gift for music made him a target in his hometown of Baghdad, where his father smashed his guitar and militants held a gun to his head for daring to follow a passion that has no place in their rigid brand of Islam.

He kept playing in defiance of his family's disapproval, with clandestine jam sessions his only outlet until the day he was selected for a monthlong U.S. cultural program that would allow him to perform in California, New Mexico and other states he'd heard about only in movies. Once in the United States, he reveled in the ability to walk down a street without raising the suspicions of gunmen, his oud, a lute-like Middle Eastern instrument, slung across his back.

DUBLIN — Gay couples of Ireland woke up Sunday in what felt like a nation reborn, with dreams of wedding plans dancing in their heads.

This new reality was sinking in after the Irish people voted with a surprisingly strong 62 percent "yes" to enshrine the right to gay marriage in the country's conservative 1937 constitution. Thousands of revelers of all sexual identities celebrated until dawn after the result was announced Saturday night.

"I said yes to Katherine 12 years ago at our marriage in Canada," Gilligan, nearby, shouted to the crowd. "And now we are bringing the 'yes' back home to Ireland, our country of Ireland! Yes, yes, yes!"

After a furious firefight, the two men were rescued, but that episode in 2006 would change Dowling's life.

Now employed by a small defense company, he is part of a crash effort by U.S. Special Operations Command to produce a radically new protective suit for elite soldiers to wear into battle — one with bionic limbs, head-to-toe armor, a built-in power supply and live data feeds projected on a see-through display inside the helmet.

BAGHDAD — Islamic State militants have provoked a global outcry by attacking ancient monuments with jackhammers and bulldozers. But they also have been quietly selling off smaller antiquities from Iraq and Syria, earning millions of dollars in an increasingly organized pillaging of national treasures, according to officials and experts.

The extremist group's recent capture of Syria's majestic 2,000-year-old ruins at Palmyra threw a spotlight on the risk that Islamic State poses to the region's rich cultural heritage. It is however, just one of 4,500 sites under the group's control, according to the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force.

Danti, who advises the State Department on the trade in plundered antiquities from Iraq and Syria, said some looted items have made their way to U.S. and other Western markets — especially antiquities in the lower- and medium-price ranges, such as stone seals with cuneiform inscriptions.

### PRO: Obama's best choice: Put boots on the ground and snuff the Islamic State

President Barack Obama has no choice now. If he wants to defeat the Islamic State group, he'll have to become a real war leader. He may not like it, but putting troops on the ground is the surest way to win this war.

The moment the group, also known as ISIS, established a territorial state in Iraq, it posed two grave threats to the U.S. and its friends and allies.

The Arab countries were unable to deal with Israel to secure self-determination on the Palestinian side. Bin Laden attracted the youth of the Middle East by telling them that violence was the only way to fight the West and to force Israel to accommodate the Palestinians.

INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — When Kari Knudtson's 10-year-old fourth grader at Mill Creek Elementary School in Independence, Mo., became wildly disruptive in school last month, he was taken from his classroom and put in the school's isolation room.

Schools have dealt with students acting out in class since time immemorial. Over the years, how teachers resolved potentially dangerous disruptions — a child throwing objects, for example — has changed from a ruler to the knuckles, to in-school suspension, to expelling a student altogether.

In recent years, parents in Texas and Washington have accused schools of putting children in isolation rooms and isolation boxes for hours as punishment. But new research has touched off a national movement away from the use of isolation under any circumstances, because some say it doesn't really work.

The isolation room at Mill Creek "is an empty room with a door that opens into the room," said Janet Richards, assistant superintendent of elementary education in Independence. It had previously been used as a conference room, copy room and a small instructional room.

RAMLE, Israel — The Israeli school year has begun, but thousands of children from the Arab minority who attend Christian schools are still on summer vacation because of a strike protesting cuts in government funding that critics say amount to discrimination.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20120910_Syria_profile.jpg" />SAFED, Israel — The 9-year-old Syrian boy with no legs wheeled himself down a bright hospital corridor, stopping to accept a pain pill from one nurse and a high-five from another.

He has been here for a month, ever since a Syrian government warplane flew low over his village and dropped a bomb that killed two of his cousins and blew apart his lower limbs.

As civil war rages in Syria, with an estimated 130,000 people killed and millions displaced after nearly three years of fighting, Israel has been quietly providing aid to some of the wounded. Since the effort was launched by the Israeli army, officials say, more than 700 Syrians have received treatment at medical centers in Israel or at a field hospital operated by medics along the heavily fortified border.

The Tribune is not using the last names of the teens because Kanak said they could face backlash at home for their participation in the program.

REHOVOT, Israel — Decked with balloons and cheerful signs, Israeli schools opened their gates Monday as 2 million children returned to school in a welcome sign of normality after the Gaza war.

In Israel, rather than hitting the books immediately, students will be eased back with two weeks of discussions about personal experiences and "relaxing activities, facilitating emotional expression," the Education Ministry said. Special, if discreet, attention was given Monday to pupils whose families lost loved ones in the fighting.

The ivory ban is a key component of a new, national strategy for combating wildlife trafficking, unveiled Tuesday by the White House, seven months after President Barack Obama issued a call to action during a visit to Tanzania. In addition, the U.S. will seek to strengthen global enforcement and international cooperation to fight an illicit trade estimated to total about $10 billion per year.

Wildlife advocates are concerned that without forceful global action, elephants and rhinos face [extinction](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species). Once numbering in the millions, Africa's elephant population has dwindled to 500,000 or less, said Dan Ashe, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. About 35,000 — or nearly 10 percent of the remaining population — are being slaughtered each year.

The crackdown relies on laws about conservation and endangered species that have been on the books for years, including decades-old prohibitions on importing ivory. But inconsistent implementation and lax enforcement have meant that once the ivory is in the U.S., domestic transactions have been essentially unregulated.

That means someone who placed an ivory chess set for sale on eBay, for example, faced little risk of running afoul of law enforcement — even if they lacked proof the item met one of the exceptions, such as being an antique.

"This legal trade has essentially provided a smoke screen that makes it possible for this illicit trade and has made it more difficult for our enforcement officials to ferret out that crime and then prosecute that crime," Ashe said in an interview.

Still, the Fish and Wildlife Service won't seek to prosecute individuals, such as those who try to sell ivory trinkets they inherited from their parents, Ashe said. Instead, the agency will target its law enforcement efforts toward organized trafficking rings that profit from the illicit trade.

While unveiling the strategy, the Obama administration also called on Congress to pass new laws to further crack down on the trafficking. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, R-Calif., said his panel would review Obama's strategy to ensure it is "robust, aggressive and effective." And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she planned to introduce legislation to allow prosecutors to apply statutes used for drug trafficking and money laundering cases to wildlife trafficking.

KINGSTON, Jamaica — Barefoot and dressed in donated clothes, 12-year-old Renaldo Brown methodically plays scales on a flute under the canopy of trees at a Jamaican vocational school renowned for nurturing many of this music-steeped island's top instrumentalists.

A residential facility operated by Catholic nuns since the late 19th century, the school has long been the cradle of Jamaica's prolific music culture — and a beacon of hope for at-risk youngsters. Decade after decade, Alpha alumni have emerged from the musical hothouse in Kingston to bring the sounds of Jamaican ska, rocksteady and reggae to the world.

WASHINGTON — Archaeologists have uncovered human remains of four of the earliest leaders of the English colony that would become America, buried for more than 400 years near the altar of what was America's first Protestant church in Jamestown, Virginia.

The four burial sites were uncovered in the earthen floor of what was Jamestown's historic Anglican church from 1608, a team of scientists and historians announced July 28. The site is the same church where Pocahontas famously married Englishman John Rolfe, leading to peace between the Powhatan Indians and colonists at the first permanent English settlement in America.

But he ended up joining his father's cleaning business and now, the 51-year-old head custodian and self-made handyman at Tahoma High School cherishes the joys of his job: the satisfying jingle of a ring of keys, fresh plastic bags lining a tidy row of trash cans and, most of all, spending days with his quirky father and college-aged son, who also work part-time cleaning the school.

Bergum prefers his relative anonymity — he's the man behind the curtain, he says — but recently he's getting some extra attention as one of 10 finalists for national Janitor of the Year.

Cintas, the contest's sponsor, sorted through hundreds of nominations for the nation's top janitor then whittled the list to 10, based on the number of people who recommended them, and what they wrote.

Bergum, nominated by his father plus five others, is the only finalist from Washington.

Online voting between now and May 1 will determine the winner, who will receive a $2,500 check, plus another $2,500 in cleaning supplies for his or her school.

Other janitors at the school said they are voting for Bergum as often as they can. Some Tahoma High teachers have told Bergum that entire classrooms of students have voted for him.

Most of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture (state) have been given ultrasound checkups since the March 2011 meltdowns at the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. The most recent statistics, released in August, show that thyroid cancer is suspected or confirmed in 137 of those children, a number that rose by 25 from a year earlier. Elsewhere, the disease occurs in only about one or two of every million children per year by some estimates.

TOKYO — When Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, was visiting Egypt earlier this year, he pledged $200 million in aid for refugees displaced by the rise of the so-called Islamic State. "We are going to provide assistance for refugees and displaced persons from Iraq and Syria," he said.

Now, as a torrent of refugees flows out of the Middle East and into Europe, many people are wondering why rich Gulf nations and the United States are not doing more to help. And some in Japan are also wondering if their country should be doing more than giving money.

"Japan is called 'a country with a closed door for refugees.' We should change this closed nature and consider accepting refugees from conflict zones proactively," the paper said. "Figuring out how to tackle this humanitarian crisis is not an issue only for Europe."

But Japan, which has gone to great lengths to rehabilitate its image since World War II, prides itself on being a good global citizen. It is one of the largest aid donors in the world. Last year Japan gave $181.6 million to the UNHCR, the U.N.'s refugee agency, making it second only to the United States in generosity.

When it comes to putting its mouth where its money is, however, Japan is not doing well. It accepted just 11 asylum-seekers out of a record 5,000 applications last year, according to Ministry of Justice data, giving Japan a refugee recognition rate of just 0.2 percent, one of the lowest among industrialized economies.

"The low recognition rate is shameful," immigration lawyer Shogo Watanabe told Reuters when the statistics were released. But this was almost double the number taken in during 2013, when Japan accepted just six refugees, the lowest number in 15 years.

Others have called Japan's acceptance rate "miserly." "Japan has done less than any other large democracy to alleviate the refugee crisis through granting asylum," Japanese journalist Harada Kazuyoshi wrote on Nippon.com, a website partly funded by the government, earlier this year.

"It's a little bit lonely," said Taiki Kato, 11, who said he was looking forward to going to middle school next year. "It's a bit bigger and there might be kids from other elementary schools."

Five minutes offshore, he idles along some buoys. His rotund nephew and a 17-year-old apprentice haul in a net. Ito grabs a shell bigger than a man's palm, opens it with a rusty blade, and quickly rinses it with seawater. "Yume-gaki," he says, foisting the shell on two visiting city slickers. "Dream oyster. Try it!"

"Right now, it seems like basketball is the only thing that holds the community together, like the third and fourth generations," said George Imamura, past president of the South Bay F.O.R. Junior Sports Association, the largest Japanese-American basketball organization in Southern California. "That's why I think it's so important that if that's all we have right now, to keep it going."

The tragic bombings during the Boston Marathon on April 15 inspired the timing of Collins' announcement. In his essay, he wrote that the incident, "Reinforced the notion that I shouldn't wait for the circumstances of my coming out to be perfect. Things can change in an instant, so why not live truthfully?"

Since the release of his Sports Illustrated essay, Collins has received an outpouring of positive support. Just hours after the story broke, he received a call from President Barack Obama commending him on his courage.

"He seems like a terrific young man, and I told him I couldn't be prouder," the president told CNN. "One of the extraordinary measures of progress that we've seen in this country has been the recognition that the LGBT community deserves full equality – not just partial equality, not just tolerance, but a recognition that they're fully a part of the American family."

Collins wrote that he was not sure what the reaction of his fellow basketball players would be. But if this week was any indication, he has nothing to worry about. NBA stars Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash of the Los Angeles Lakers went to Twitter to show their support and respect.

Tidal officials did not disclose financial details about how artists played on Tidal would be compensated.

"Our goal is simple: We want to create a better service and a better experience for both fans and artists," singer Alicia Keys, one of the owners of Tidal, said at the news conference. "We believe it's in everyone's best interests to preserve the value of music."

Singer Taylor Swift famously yanked her latest album "1989" from Spotify last fall because she did not want her songs offered on the service's free version. She maintains that music should not be free because it sets a dangerous precedent that consumers don't have to pay for listening to albums.

Tidal, which is available in 31 countries, had 500,000 paid subscribers by the end of 2014. It has plans to expand to six additional countries.

However, the artist-owned service faces competition from an already crowded streaming service marketplace.

In November, Daniel Ek, Spotify's chief executive, responded to musicians' criticism in a blog post, noting that an artist as big as Swift could make up to $6 million a year on the platform.

Then Bush, formally announcing his run for the White House, turned serious, making his point humbly and unmistakably clear: The presidency, he said, was something to be earned, not inherited.

"Not a one of us deserves the job," the former Florida governor told a hometown crowd Monday, "by right of resume, party, seniority, family or family narrative.

"It's nobody's turn," Bush went on, in what served as well as a poke at the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton. "It's everybody's test, and it's wide open — exactly as a contest for president should be."

The question of dynastic succession for Bush, the son of former President George H.W. Bush and the younger brother of former President George W. Bush, is one of the largest hurdles facing him in his historic White House bid.

Growing up, it wasn't very common for an Asian-American to be investing as much time as I did into a sport like basketball, and on many of the teams I played for, I was either the only or one of very few Asian-Americans. This made me an easy target for opponents, and unfortunately, I was often mocked for my ethnicity.

In middle school, some of the players on opposing league teams called me a "Chinese import" or told me to "go back to China." When I started playing basketball in the Ivy League, the bullying I faced became even more blatant. During some of our games, people would openly call me hurtful racial slurs like "chink" and "gook" or even ask me if I could see the scoreboard with my eyes. They heckled me by chanting Asian foods like "shrimp fried rice." 

Bullying often comes from a place of deep insecurity. When people bully, they are trying to elevate themselves by pushing someone else down. To do that, they might try to find something that is different about you to use against you. But the differences that you have from the rest of your peers are what make you special. 

After years of bullying, I am extremely proud to be an Asian-American in the NBA. If I had let the name-calling get to me enough to make me feel like I didn't have the right to be on the basketball court, I wouldn't be able to go to my dream job every day. If Coach Blakeney hadn't taken me aside and encouraged me to persevere through bullying, I might have continued to lose my temper or given up along the way. 

"It was a complete shock to all of us," recalled William Thorpe, the athlete's 85-year-old son, who was there that day. "We are all set to bury Dad in Oklahoma and then — boom! — he was gone, never to be returned."

Thorpe, along with a brother and the Sac and Fox Nation, prevailed in April in a federal lawsuit demanding that the town return his father's body for burial on the Oklahoma reservation. A federal judge ruled that the town was subject to the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, which governs the return of human remains and other Indian artifacts.

The memorial overlooks a grassy slope featuring statues saluting his varied athletic career. Tributes are inscribed on the monuments and mausoleum, including a comment to Thorpe from King Gustav V of Sweden at the medal ceremony: "Sir, you are the world's greatest athlete." (Thorpe supposedly replied, "Thanks, King.")

It is difficult for outsiders to comprehend the adoration for Thorpe from townspeople whose only connection to him is his name. Residents and private groups have raised money over the years, with a small contribution from the borough council, to erect a $60,000 statue of Thorpe throwing a discus and a $50,000 one of him running with a football. Fundraising is underway to add a baseball statue.

According to a history compiled by the Sac and Fox Nation, Thorpe's widow and Oklahoma's governor negotiated a deal for the state to build a grave site and memorial after Thorpe's death at age 64 in Lomita, Calif. But after the Legislature approved funding, the governor abruptly changed course and vetoed it.

ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan — Only empty desert three years ago, the Mideast's largest camp for Syrian civil war refugees has grown from a town of tents into a bustling city.

But behind the plans is a cold reality for the 81,000 exiles living in the Zaatari Refugee Camp: The conflict back home, now its fifth year, won't be over anytime soon.

Zaatari, born out of necessity in the desert on July 28, 2012, is now the ninth-biggest city in Jordan, a stalwart U.S. ally. Today, this tiny kingdom hosts 629,000 Syrian refugees, out of a regional total of more than 4 million. More than 100,000 live in camps in Jordan, including 20,000 in the newer Azraq refugee camp, while the rest struggle to survive in cities with U.N. cash and food assistance.

Tools for juicing at home are also a big business; one of the dozens of juicer choices, a stainless steel model with more than 100 Amazon.com reviews, sells for close to $1,200. Meanwhile, more than 40 books or e-books related to juice or smoothies have been released in the last 30 days alone on Amazon.com, with the majority mentioning health, weight loss or both in their titles.

But according to dietitians and nutrition scientists, juice is far from the healthiest way to consume fruit, and one expert went so far as to call its popularity a dangerous trend. "The fruit juice industry has essentially taken the 'apple-a-day' mentality and used it to sell fruit juices as healthy," said Barry Popkin, a professor in the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Public Health.

Popkin and other experts would rather see people eating whole fruit. Because most juicing methods remove the produce's fiber, drinking juice omits one of the key benefits of eating fruit, while delivering huge amounts of sugar and calories.

"Every one of the long-term studies of the health effects of fruit juices shows that you increase your risk of diabetes and weight gain" with regular juice consumption, Popkin said.

One 2010 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology followed more than 43,000 adults in Singapore for five years and found that those who consumed two or more servings of fruit juice per week had a 29 percent higher risk of developing diabetes than those who didn't drink juice regularly — not far behind the 42 percent increased risk for weekly soda drinkers.

Plus, the fiber in fruit complements the vitamins and minerals, so juice drinkers miss out on the optimal health benefits, said Bethany Doerfler, clinical research dietitian in the division of gastroenterology at Northwestern Medicine.

Americans already are harming their health by not consuming enough fiber, said Joanne Slavin, professor in the Department of Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Minnesota and a self-described "fiber person."

Diets higher in fiber are associated with lower risk of cardiovascular disease and lower body weight, Slavin said, yet most American adults only achieve half the recommended daily fiber intake, which is 25 to 38 grams.

"I want people to eat more fiber," Slavin said, and that includes choosing whole fruits over juice.

Eating fiber also contributes to a feeling of fullness, or satiety, that helps prevent people from overeating. In one study, published in the journal Appetite in 2009, people who ate apple slices before lunch felt more full and subsequently consumed 15 percent fewer calories than those who drank apple juice.

But a member of the Ohlone tribe, Andrew Galvan, said sainthood for Serra is welcome.

American families with kids bought 101 fewer calories per person per day in packaged foods in 2012 than they did in 2007, according to an analysis of a pledge by big food companies to reduce calories in the marketplace. It's an "impressive" accomplishment but not sufficient to reverse childhood obesity, experts say.

"There has been a cultural shift in this country — especially households with kids have really started buying fewer calories," Barry Popkin, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of North Carolina, said Monday by phone. Popkin and Shu Wen Ng, also of the University of North Carolina, wrote the evaluation of what people bought, using Nielsen Homescan data of more than 61,000 households; they and Meghan Slining evaluated what was sold.

There are hundreds of reasons to suspect that our solar system used to have more and bigger inner planets — the hundreds of multiplanetary systems discovered by planet-hunting projects such as NASA's Kepler mission. Although our solar system is essentially empty inward of Mercury, equivalent regions around most other stars appear to be packed with close-in, intermediate-mass planets — those between the size of Earth and Neptune. Hopeful astronomers have dubbed these worlds "super-Earths" but most of them seem to be more like hydrogen-rich, gas-shrouded mini-Neptunes — very unearthly indeed. "Now that we can look at our own solar system in the context of all these other planetary systems," Laughlin says, "the standard-issue planetary system in our galaxy seems to be a set of super-Earths with alarmingly short orbital periods. Our solar system is looking increasingly like an oddball."

_Get along with the voices inside of my head_

"Interacting with the kids themselves, it's what gives me life," he said. "It's what inspires me."

CLARK STATE FISHING LAKE, Kan. — The relative gentleness of the 150-mile drive west from Wichita adds to the "Oh my gosh" gasp when you top the small rise on K-94, about 30 miles southwest of Greensburg. Why pioneers named it the Bluff Creek Valley is instantly obvious. So is why many modern Kansans call it the prettiest public fishing hole in Kansas.

For hundreds of feet, the prairie falls off at angles so steep that even the area's mule deer, with their pogo-stick legs, would find much of it inaccessible. The highway uses sharp turns to ease vehicles into a valley studded with tall cottonwoods and feathery willows.

Across the valley stretches 300 acres of water so clear that you can see a fishing lure 4 feet below the surface, as well as the fish attached to it.

"These fish are so fat, their mouths always look small," Joey Yeager said as he unhooked a brick of a bass Tuesday afternoon. "I don't think I've ever seen a skinny bass in this lake."

"It's gotten to where I kind of expect to catch a 5-pounder every time I come," he said as he launched his boat, and headed to a cove on the lake's western shoreline. Aberson was along for the first couple of hours.

The first bass of the day, a chunky fish pushing 2 pounds, hit a 3-inch plastic bait. When Yeager and Aberson started flipping plastic lizards and crawdads into flooded vegetation, things began to happen. Yeager soon jerked several bass aboard of about a pound. Aberson set the hook hard on a fish by an old beaver den and took his time pulling the conservative 3-pounder aboard.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Jake Betts looked every bit a cowboy as he tugged the reins of a horse named Leroy and jangled up a ridge.

Somewhere out in the hills are thousands of head of Mexican-born beef cattle, about a year old, unaware they soon will be herded into 18-wheelers for the third or fourth time in their lives, now destined for the feedlot.

"By signing this bill into law, Gov. Brownback has added to the burden that the poorest Kansans already carry. … It's always been hard to be poor in Kansas. Now, it's going to be a lot harder," Cotsoradis said in an email.

Let other octogenarians take it easy. Despite gray hair, wrinkles and 17 great-grandchildren, Dugan has no intention of going gentle into that good night. Now 80, she is a third-degree black belt in American karate who can still snap off a spinning back kick and break boards and bones with her feet.

"Want to know what my grandsons say about me?" she says as a smile sneaks across her face. "Well, you know how kids in school say, 'My dad can beat up your dad'? They say, 'My grandma can beat up your dad!' "

Laugh if you will. But this karate grandma is no joke.

As the first scientist to study the skeleton unearthed in Eastern Washington almost two decades ago, Chatters was embroiled in a controversy over race and cultural identity stirred up by the 9,500-year-old bones. His assertion that the mystery man didn't look anything like modern Native Americans infuriated Northwest Tribes, who consider the remains those of an ancestor and sued for the right to rebury what they call the Ancient One.

The divers who found the skeleton named her "Naia," Greek for water nymph.

Kenyatta said in his television address that the military and police operation at the mall was "delicate" because the main priority was to save the lives of hostages. He vowed that the gunmen would be caught and punished.

"We have overcome terrorist attacks before," he said. "We have fought courageously and defeated them in and outside our borders. We will defeat them again.

"I urge all Kenyans to stand together and see this dark moment through."

SAN JOSE, Calif. — Crippled in space, the Kepler spacecraft's planet-hunting days are likely over. But its discoveries may be yet to come.

"The signals are there, in the data we have now — we have to search for them," said William Borucki, a space scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California, and the Kepler mission's principal investigator.

For the past four years, the $600 million Kepler has been a prolific planet detector from its lonely orbit, fixing its meter-wide lens, a photometer, on stars to detect the subtle dimming that occurs every time a planet passes in front of — or "transits" — its sun.

If the spacecraft and program funding had lasted until it ran out of fuel — in 2019 — it would have collected so much data that signs of an Earth-like planet would have been easily confirmed, the researchers said. The Kepler program has paved the way for two more planet-seeking missions.

A letter made public last week and signed by several former Obama administration officials urged the U.S. government to accept 100,000 Syrian migrants, and to put in place special rules to speed the resettlement process. Germany says it will accept as many as a million Syrians this year.

"I personally came here in search of a future," said a mother of three daughters who made it to Germany with her 5-year-old but left two others behind in Syria with her parents. She hopes they all can come, too.

In 2011, two Kentucky residents who had been resettled as Iraqi refugees were accused of being al-Qaida members. They were convicted of terrorism charges after their fingerprints were linked to roadside bombs in Iraq. That led to new steps to screen refugees, a process that has been criticized as slow and bureaucratic.

In Washington, Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a television interview that the United States "has to do more and I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000 and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable."

Kerry said the migrant crisis must ultimately be solved by ending Syria's civil war and replacing President Bashar Assad.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama announced Friday that he was rejecting the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline project because it wouldn't serve U.S. interests, dismissing its potential economic benefits as insignificant in the long run as he sought to close a long-running chapter in the political fight over global warming.

Imagine for a moment that all of the nation's fast-food establishments — all the striped awnings and golden arches, the drive-thru windows, the beckoning dollar deals and wafting odor of french fries — were to vanish overnight. Would the number of our kids who carry an unhealthful amount of extra weight plummet?

The answer is very likely no, says a study published this week in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Because if you shut off the supply of 24-ounce fountain drinks, bacon cheeseburgers, fried chicken and stuffed tacos, the children who frequently eat at fast-food restaurants will go home and do what they generally do when not eating at a fast-food restaurant: They'll snarf cookies and chips, chug sugar-sweetened soda from a bottle, and heat up frozen pizzas.

In a new study, researchers from the University of North Carolina led by nutrition professor Barry Popkin have found that even when they are not eating at fast-food restaurants, children who frequent them tend to eat food that would probably make many of them overweight or [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) anyway. The authors of the latest research combed through a national database of Americans' health and nutrition behaviors and grouped 4,466 American kids — from ages 2 to 18 — according to what they ate when they were not eating food purchased at a fast-food restaurant.

Life isn't fair.

That universal truth is something that children seem to understand almost intuitively at a young age, but the path through which they develop a sense of what's fair and what isn't — and how they act on injustices — is something that has been a puzzle for social scientists.

An albino variety of California kingsnake popular in the pet trade has infested the Canary Islands, decimating native bird, mammal and lizard species that have had no time to evolve evasive patterns in what was once a stable ecology northwest of Africa.

"Once the kids got over the trauma of learning to use the needles, they really picked it up," Visconti said. "Part of our logic behind the lab was that they would form a community. The knitters are a tight group."

"I don't have to buy things anymore," she said. "I can just make them. At first I was shy about creating and sharing my designs. Now I'm more open to it. Knitting forces you to be open to other ideas."

On a hot day in Australia, a koala's thick fur is not necessarily an asset. The marsupials don't retreat to dens or dugouts, and the water that would help them cool off can be hard to come by. In the wild, the animals "can suffer high mortality during extreme heat events," according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters.

The authors of the study figured koalas must do something to cool off in hot weather. To figure out what it was, they put radio collars on 37 koalas in southeastern Australia and tracked their movements during the winter of 2009 and the summer of 2010-11. (In the land Down Under, summer lasts from December to March.)

The researchers kept detailed records of these koalas' activities, noting their posture and their preferences for high or low branches. The scientists also used a portable weather station to assess the microclimate conditions just a couple of feet from where the koalas made themselves comfortable.

For additional data, the scientists observed another 130 koalas in the area that weren't wearing collars.

What they discovered was that the koalas' posture on hot days was quite different than on cooler days. In the summer, the animals arrayed themselves in trees in a way that exposed more of their surface area. This often meant hugging a tree trunk or a large branch closer to the ground, with arms and legs outstretched. In the winter, koalas ventured higher up in the tree and farther out onto the branches.

But Bryant's last three seasons have ended early due to injuries, and he played in only 41 games over the previous two years. He has struggled mightily in the first 16 games of this season with mostly young teammates on a rebuilding roster, making a career-worst 32 percent of his shots and dealing with pain and exhaustion every day.

In recent months, Bryant repeatedly said he didn't know whether he would play another season, clearly hoping for a rebound in his health and the Lakers' fortunes.

Neither has happened, and the ever-impatient Bryant didn't wait any longer to decide his future.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Caltech_Prototype_Toilet_Room_View_1.jpg" />Aligning itself with a group of doctoral students in California, Kohler Co. is lending a hand to an effort to reinvent the toilet.

This may prompt you to snicker. Don't. It's not funny, and the fact that nice people avoid talking about human waste contributes to what is an enormous and deadly problem.

In India, for example, the United Nations estimates that more than 600 million people don't use toilets. They don't use latrines either. They go on the ground.

And that's just one country. While significant improvement has occurred in the past 20 years, an estimated 1 billion people worldwide still practice open defecation. Another 700 million use unhygienic facilities such as "hanging latrines" that discharge directly into streams, or buckets that may simply be emptied in the streets.

All told, estimates of annual deaths from diarrhea, the majority of them spawned by feces-contaminated water, range as high as 1.5 million. Most of the victims are under 5 years old.

But Kohler also is among the world's five largest manufacturers of plumbing products, with 2011 sales in the category of $1.8 billion, according to market researcher The Freedonia Group. And when the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, by far the country's biggest and most generous foundation, announced its attention-grabbing "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" in 2011, Kohler took notice.

It's been a long time since this field saw radical change. The modern flush toilet, author Rose George wrote in her 2008 book, "The Big Necessity," works in essentially the same way as the device invented in the late 1500s by Sir John Harington, a rakish English courtier, author and wit who installed one of his toilets for Queen Elizabeth I at her palace in Surrey.

"That's very, very expensive," said Doulaye Kone, an environmental engineer who grew up in a village in Africa's Ivory Coast and now is the Gates Foundation's senior program officer for water, sanitation and hygiene. "It's a huge capital investment. It's a very big operational cost. … It will work in very few (developing world) cities."

The Caltech toilet went on to win the Gates challenge in 2012. As Hoffmann and his students prepared to fine-tune the prototype and get it ready for field testing in India, set to begin later this year, Kohler offered to continue its support.

When Olivia Hernandez was a middle schooler in Oxnard, California, she became hooked on K-wave — the global phenomenon of South Korean pop music, television and culture. Inspired by the romantic series "My Lovely Sam Soon" and bands like Clazziquai, she taught herself the Korean alphabet and learned a few phrases.

While the North Koreans do not have the capacity to strike the U.S. mainland, the medium-range weapons do have the potential to reach U.S. military bases on the Pacific island of Guam. North Korea has also threatened its neighbors South Korea and Japan, both strong U.S. allies.

Kraft Macaroni & Cheese — that favorite food of kids, packaged in the nostalgic blue box — will soon be free of yellow dye. Kraft announced Monday that it will remove artificial food coloring, notably Yellow No. 5 and Yellow No. 6 dyes, from its iconic product by January 2016. Instead, the pasta will maintain its bright yellow color by using natural ingredients: paprika, turmeric and annatto (the latter of which is derived from achiote tree seeds).

The company said it decided to pull the dyes in response to growing consumer pressure for more natural foods. But claims that the dyes may be linked to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children have also risen recently, as they did years ago, putting food dyes under sharp focus once again. On its website Kraft says synthetic colors are not harmful, and that their motivation to remove them is because consumers want more foods with no artificial colors.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains artificial food dyes are safe but some research studies have found the dyes can contribute to hyperactive behavior in children. Food dyes have been controversial since pediatrician Benjamin Feingold published findings in the 1970s that suggested a link between artificial colors and hyperactive behavior, but scientists, consumers and the government have not yet reached a consensus on the extent of this risk or the correct path to address it.

After a 2007 study in the U.K. showed that artificial colors and/or the common preservative sodium benzoate increased hyperactivity in children, the European Union started requiring food labels indicating that a product contains any one of six dyes that had been investigated. The label states the product "may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children." The FDA convened a Food Advisory Committee meeting in 2011 to review the existing research, and concluded that there was not sufficient evidence proving that foods with artificial colors caused hyperactivity in the general population. The FDA also decided that further research was needed, and that a label disclosing a possible link between dyes and hyperactivity was unnecessary.

Bernard Weiss, professor emeritus of the Department of Environmental Medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center who has researched this issue for decades, says he is frustrated that the FDA has not acted on the research showing the connection between artificial dyes and hyperactivity. "All the evidence we have has showed that it has some capacity to harm," he says. "In Europe that's enough to get it banned because a manufacturer has to show lack of toxic effects. In this country it's up to the government to find out whether or not there are harmful effects." Weiss supports banning artificial colors until companies have evidence that they cause no harm. Like most other scientists in this field, he thinks more research, particularly investigating dyes' effects on the developing brain, is imperative.

LOS ANGELES — When studying earthquakes, especially in California, scientists often find that ocean waves get in the way. As the water hits the coast, it creates tiny seismic waves that interfere with researchers' efforts to listen for the bigger waves created by quakes.

Ocean waves create seismic waves billions of times weaker than the seismic waves produced by earthquakes. Together, these waves are known as the ambient seismic field, but scientists have another word for it: noise.

"The earthquake threat is real for Southern California," Beroza said. "Sometime in the future we'll have a big earthquake in Southern California, and these sorts of studies can help us anticipate the reach of these earthquakes and … can motivate the public and governments to prepare for them."

The decision, which came after an impassioned and at times highly personal debate at the City Council, highlights the backlash the smokeless cigarettes have generated as their popularity grows.

Dr. Jonathan Fielding, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public of Health, said the growing acceptance of "vaping" — as e-cigarette use is known — threatens to undermine decades of public education efforts aimed at stigmatizing smoking. Other e-cigarette opponents said they do not want to risk the possibility that the secondhand vapor will be found to be harmful.

The city's selection as the U.S. nominee marks the start of a two-year competition. The International Olympic Committee will pick the host city in September 2017, and Rome, Paris, Hamburg, Germany, and Budapest, Hungary, are also in pursuit of the 2024 Games.

Until the stadium is complete, the Rams are expected to play temporarily at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum. If the Chargers join them, it's unclear where they will play, though the NFL sees Angel Stadium, Dodger Stadium and even the Rose Bowl, which declined last year to bid on hosting a team, as potential options.

That changed in January 2014, when Kroenke bought 60 acres of land for an estimated $101 million next to 238 acres of the Hollywood Park site owned by San Francisco-based developer Stockbridge Capital. At the time, the NFL downplayed the development in public but behind the scenes it reinvigorated the L.A. process.

It's far from the only lab in the world that is pursuing the futuristic idea of growing organs for transplant. But the London work was showcased Tuesday as Mayor Boris Johnson announced a plan to attract more labs to do cutting-edge health and science research in the area.

While only a handful of patients have received the British lab-made organs so far— including tear ducts, blood vessels and windpipes — researchers hope they will soon be able to transplant more types of body parts into patients, including what would be the world's first nose made partly from stem cells.

Tapping into the data-driven policing trend, the department uses heat maps, technology and years of statistics to identify crime hot spots. Pilots then use their downtime to fly over them, on the theory that would-be criminals tend to rethink their nefarious plans when there's an airship hovering overhead.

Rather than face arrest or citations for violations like possessing alcohol or marijuana on school property, students could be referred to off-site counseling centers or sent to the principal's office — a shift that activists, educators and justice officials say will prevent students, especially minorities, from becoming mired in the criminal justice system.

POWELL, Wyo. — The autumn moon has taken its seat low in the evening sky as the cars arrive at Wyoming's last drive-in theater. Pokey Heny stands ready to indulge in another night of small-town sociability.

At 52, the owner of the American Dream Drive-in leans out the snack bar door to collect a $15 per-vehicle entry fee. She greets people by their first names, telling a 4-year-old girl she likes her stuffed hippo, named Martha. Then a single mother and daughter roll up in an aging pickup. Heny lets them in for 10 bucks.

Then she looks out toward the big screen looming in the twilight and sees families sprawled on car hoods, in lawn chairs and the beds of backed-in trucks — dogs crouched between toddlers buried under woolen blankets. And she smiles, knowing she's helping to preserve a vital ritual in this a ranching town of 6,000 residents near the Montana border.

The venture first opened in 1949 as Wyoming's first drive-in. Today business plays out like a Saturday night thriller: the future in doubt as Heny battles studios seeking to increase profits and drive-ins' dwindling popularity. This year, as Hollywood switches to a digital format, replacing standard 35-millimeter prints at drive-ins countrywide, she faced a reel dilemma — go modern or go dark.

"It's like carnival when you catch a whale," says Stowe, standing next to his beached 28-foot whale sailboat Persecution, inspecting the brass tip of a hand-thrown wooden harpoon. "But we don't kill whales for joke. We kill whales for food."

ARMENIA, El Salvador — Roosemberth Palacios sports braces on his teeth and a curly mop of hair. At 16, he finds high school boring. So after school, he logs onto his computer and hunts for challenges.

He's found them in difficult online courses offered by professors at Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

He says he's aced a course called "Machine Learning" by hot-shot Stanford professor Andrew Ng, scoring a perfect 100. And he took a sophomore-level course by MIT professor Anant Agarwal called "Circuits and Electronics," tallying 91 percent.

To patch up some weakness he saw in his own math skills, he took a course, "Numerical Analysis," offered online by the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne in Switzerland. The class was in French.

The world of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, is roiling academia at universities in the United States, where they are labeled either the future or the downfall of higher education.

Cushing was awarded the Medal of Honor through the efforts of Margaret Zerwekh, an amateur historian who decided to research the Cushing family after moving to the Cushing homestead in Delafield in the 1960s. When she pored through accounts of Cushing's heroism on July 3, 1863, and read memoirs of the men who were with the first lieutenant when he died, she thought he deserved the Medal of Honor.

Through more than three decades Zerwekh never gave up, despite numerous setbacks, mounds of paperwork and several changes in Wisconsin's congressional delegation. And Thursday, Zerwekh, now 94, was at the White House to witness a ceremony she spent so much time and effort to see.

Edward Avila was a Silicon Valley tech veteran when he launched his first startup a few years ago. As he made the rounds at networking events, though, he noticed something jarring.

"Out of hundreds of [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur)," he said, "I felt like I was the only Latino in the room."

He's not far off: Numbers from venture capital clearinghouse CB Insights indicate less than 1 percent of venture-backed startups have a Latino co-founder. It's an especially sobering statistic in a valley where census figures show one-quarter of the population is Hispanic.

The effort already has drawn backers ranging from Google to pop powerhouse Jennifer Lopez.

Too, Ruiz pointed to the low numbers of Latinos who study science or business in college — or even finish high school.

Flores, a former IBM engineer, brought in the third member of the founding team, David Lopez — a longtime computer technician whose daughter happens to be J-Lo. Flores built the website for a restaurant David and Jennifer Lopez once owned in Pasadena, Calif.; Avila said the 12-week Manos program will include a trip to Los Angeles for the entrepreneurs to pitch their ideas to Latino celebrities including Mario Lopez and Eva Longoria.

LOS ANGELES — Yolanda Garcia's grandparents migrated from Mexico and worked multiple jobs — in farm fields and school cafeterias — to save money to send all six children to college.

Along the way, the family moved up the ladder, from South Los Angeles to the upscale Friendly Hills neighborhood of Whittier. They were the first Latinos in their immediate area. Now, there are four other Latino families there.

The Garcias' story represents a common California immigrant dream. But it's far from the reality for all Latinos, who the U.S. Census Bureau now says have surpassed non-Latino whites to become California's largest ethnic group.

A study published last year found that second-generation Mexican-Americans in California and Texas had achieved more education, higher earnings, less poverty, more white-collar jobs and greater rates of home ownership than their immigrant parents. Only about 21 percent of Mexican parents had completed high school, for instance, compared with 80 percent of their children by 2005.

"It's extraordinary the progress that Latino youth have made relative to their parents, but they are still lagging behind," said University of Southern California professor Dowell Myers, one of the report's authors. "We need to recognize how important these people are and how urgent their success is for the well-being of everyone."

Their nail guns pounded from sunup to sundown, seven days a week in the early months.

Without the Hispanic labor force, crawling out from under the debris would have taken considerably longer. These workers, many of them immigrants, were willing to endure conditions that many American workers might not have accepted.

The Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, the Gulf Coast Latin American Association and El Pueblo stepped up to address the needs of the community, connecting new immigrants with local resources.

Jody Agius Vallejo, an associate professor of sociology at USC, calls Downey the epitome of Latino upward mobility: The city that residents of working-class towns aspire to move to because of its schools and relatively low crime.

"You're in a new city and in a new place," Alarcon said. "You have to step it up a notch so you can set the foundation for the Latino family that comes after you. If you follow your old customs, nothing will change. You'll just bring the old neighborhood with you."

LOS ANGELES — Kris Ramirez never saw police as a threat. Growing up, his body didn't tense with us-versus-them dread when police cruisers drove through his Southeast Los Angeles neighborhood.

In Southern California, Latinos are a large and visible part of law enforcement. Within the LAPD, the state's largest city police department, 45 percent of officers are Latino. (Blacks make up about 11 percent of LAPD's officers.) In the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, Latinos represent 43 percent of the ranks.

CHICAGO — After growing up poor in a predominantly African-American neighborhood of Cincinnati, the young adults had reached their early 20s. One by one, they passed through an MRI machine that displayed their brains in sharp, cross-sectioned images.

The toxic metal had robbed them of gray matter in the parts of the brain that enable people to pay attention, regulate emotions and control impulses. Lead also had scrambled the production of white matter that transmits signals between different parts of the brain, largely by mimicking calcium, an element that plays a critical role in brain development. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150611_LEAD_VIOLENCE.png" />

Scars left by lead have had significant consequences for the study participants and their communities. As children, they struggled in school more than those who had not been exposed. As teens, they committed crimes more frequently, University of Cincinnati researchers reported.

"What we found — and continue to find — is that lead sowed the seeds of their future," said Kim Dietrich, a neuropsychologist who has been following the group of nearly 300 people since they were born in the late 1970s. "It isn't conducive to behavior we associate with normal development, making smart decisions and success."



But a growing body of research is making it clear that the toxic legacy of lead has far more wide-ranging effects than previously known. Lingering dust from paint and deposits from old vehicle emissions continue to harm thousands of children in older industrial cities like Cincinnati and Chicago.

Last month, a Chicago Tribune investigation found that lead hazards are festering in the same parts of Chicago that have given the city a national reputation for violence and academic failure. In impoverished, crime-ridden neighborhoods like Austin, Englewood and Lawndale, more than 80 percent of the children tested in 1995 had dangerous lead levels.

Today those kids are in their early to mid-20s, when criminal behavior peaks.

As evidence mounts of the links between lead poisoning, poor school performance and crime, some scientists are starting to focus on lead pollution as a key factor in Chicago's violence.

"People in neighborhoods like Englewood have faced multiple assaults over different periods of time — job losses, segregation, housing discrimination," said Robert J. Sampson, a Harvard University researcher who has been studying Chicago for more than two decades. "Yet through all of that there is this persistent lead poisoning. It creates a social context where kids are at a clear disadvantage."

Sampson recently added lead data to his existing research on poverty, education and crime in Englewood and other neighborhoods. The results, he said, were shocking. A map of lead poisoning rates among children younger than 6 in 1995, for instance, looks very similar to a map of aggravated assault rates in 2012, when those kids were 17 to 22 years old.

"It's not something I appreciated before," Sampson said. "But when I see the astounding levels of lead poisoning in these communities, it makes complete sense that it is part of the cycle of deprivation."

Politicians and policymakers have yet to catch up to this line of thinking, seemingly regarding lead pollution as a problem solved long ago. During the past five years, federal and state officials have sharply cut funding to screen kids, inspect properties and eliminate lead hazards.

With less money directed at the problem, children ages 5 and younger continue to be harmed at rates up to six times the Chicago average in corners of predominantly African-American neighborhoods on the South and West sides, according to the Tribune's analysis of city records.

One researcher working in Chicago, Anne Evens, recently published a study that draws a sharper focus on how lead is still ravaging the city years after it faded as a local and national issue.

A former chief of lead poisoning prevention at the Chicago Department of Public Health, Evens obtained the lead tests of more than 58,000 children born in the city from 1994 to 1998 and compared the results with how they performed on standardized tests in third grade.

Her peer-reviewed study, published in April in the scientific journal Environmental Health, found that exposure to lead during early childhood significantly increased the chance that a student would fail reading and math tests, even when controlling for other factors such as poverty, race, birth weight and the mother's education level.

The scope of what Evens found is staggering: At three-quarters of Chicago Public Schools, the average lead level of third-graders exceeded a standard established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in each year from 2003 to 2006.

Some teachers and reading specialists know that kids exposed to lead as toddlers are more likely to act out, have trouble staying on task and struggle to work well with classmates. Yet it doesn't come up in the debate about how to improve schools.

"But we're talking about our kids now," Androes said. "And there just isn't enough attention being paid to how lead affects the classroom."

Even modest reductions in lead exposure can make a difference.

Jessica Wolpaw Reyes, an economist at Amherst College, studied what happened during the 1990s when Massachusetts embarked on an effort to eliminate lead paint hazards in homes with young children. She found the $5 million-a-year program helped reduce the number of students who performed poorly on standardized tests by 1 to 2 percentage points, with most of the benefits seen among children from low-income communities.

While that might not sound like much of an improvement, Reyes said, it was equivalent to what the state could have expected if it had closed the income gap between poor and middle-income communities by 22 percent.

"There is a lot of research showing if you can intervene early with children, it costs relatively little but makes a huge difference," Reyes said. "Yet that's a hard sell to policymakers. It's tough to get people to spend money on things that aren't going to yield benefits for another 15 or 20 years."

BEIRUT — In a red-lit bar in Beirut, Lebanon, Nasser Shorbaji and Marwan Alameh try not to knock the microphones over while laughing during the broadcast of their weekly radio show.

Moments later, they turn more somber as they introduce a segment on Palestinian hip-hop, discussing the most recent outbreak of war in Gaza between Palestinians and Israelis. Heads nod in the packed bar to the rhymes of Sati, a Palestinian rapper.

Jackson Allers, an American Beirut-based journalist who specializes in Arab hip-hop, said artists in the country are just beginning to discover how much power they have.

"Their influence is increasing," he said. "They've turned the critical gaze of youth inward, at their own peer group, which I would say is positive."

Ali Rafei, 28, a graffiti and street artist from Tripoli, Lebanon's second-largest city and center of Sunni conservative culture, said his home city has largely been left to fend for itself. Since the outbreak of a civil war in neighboring Syria, Tripoli has seen fighting between Sunni militants and supporters of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

BEIRUT — It's summer in this proud Mediterranean city, with celebrities and Lebanese expats flocking to international festivals and parties at Beirut's beaches and nightclubs. But the country's own citizens are suffocating from mountains of stinking garbage collecting on the streets — yet another reflection of government paralysis and its inability to find a solution for the capital's rubbish.

Anger about the heaps of trash accumulating in Beirut's streets boiled over this week with thousands protesting in the street against a government so dysfunctional it can't hold elections or pick a president, much less deliver basic services.

In many ways, Lebanon never got over its civil war, which raged from 1975 until 1990. Some of the country's aging warlords passed on their power to their sons and relatives. Consecutive governments neglected to improve the country's infrastructure, leading to chronic water shortages and electricity cuts even now, 25 years after the war ended.

Decades of putting up with bad governance and corrupt politicians exploded at once. The "You Stink" movement, a rare, non-political people's movement, quickly picked up supporters and expanded its demands beyond just the trash in the street: It demanded the resignation of the entire government.

The "You Stink" movement also says it will not back down.

"This movement has succeeded in reawakening the Lebanese, and we will not let them make us go to sleep again," said Marwan Maarouf, a group representative.

Speaking to journalists, Maarouf called for a large protest Saturday. He said the aim continues to be "toppling an entire corrupt political class." But such a move risks plunging the country into an even greater power vacuum and instability, further straining a country's fragile financial system already inundated with Syrian war refugees.

Though "You Stink" canceled a planned protest Monday, hundreds again gathered in downtown Beirut after sunset. The event was peaceful in the early evening, with large concrete barriers blocking those in Riad El Solh Square from reaching the government building.

Using the hashtag #NoJusticeNoLebron, activists, led by writer Tariq Touré, have unleashed a Twitter campaign asking the NBA superstar to put his season on hold until the Department of Justice - which is investigating the fatal November 2014 shooting - "imprisons the murderers of Tamir Rice."

James meditated on those words during and after the 2010-11 season, his first in Miami, when the entire world turned on him overnight. He stopped listening to those with no dust on their face and continued to ignore them in July when the thought of James talking to the Cavaliers about a return seemed foolish to executives across the NBA.

"There are not many players who can come in that young and understand the magnitude of what he stands for and what he brings," said Dallas Mavericks veteran Tyson Chandler, who won gold with James during the 2012 London Olympics. "Not only what he brings to this organization, but what he brings to the city he's playing in. With that comes a lot of responsibility and he's never shied away from it."

A former middle-school teacher who lives with her family on Mercer Island, Washington, Finch is an AFOL: Adult Fan of Lego. Her Hogwarts "build" — as AFOLs call it — was featured at BrickCon 2012, the annual Seattle-area convention for those who love Lego. It won Best in Show and the People's Choice award.

Mikaila, 10, is chief executive of BeeSweet Lemonade, which she launched at age 4 1/2 after participating in a children's business competition and in Lemonade Day, a national program that teaches children financial literacy by empowering them to open their own business — a lemonade stand.

"There will be lemonade stands all across the city," Peggy Bessellieu, executive director of Lemonade Day Greater Dallas, said in advance of the event. "Lemonade Day teaches youth about financial literacy and the value of a dollar and offers skills they need to become successful in all areas of their lives."

"What I've seen a lot of times when we sit down with these kids, they want to do organic lemons and they want to have fresh raspberries in there," Bessellieu said. "When we put the numbers to it, they realize they would have to charge about $7 a glass to make a profit."

"I got stung by two bees in one week," Mikaila said. "I hated the bees. I would freak out, but my parents — they made me do some research on the bees and from that research, I found out how incredibly important bees were to our world."

Worldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year as countries intensified efforts to fight the disease. In India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills mycobacterium leprae, the germ that causes leprosy.

In 2005, India declared victory, with health authorities reporting less than one case for every 10,000 people. But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy, including in the central state of Chattisgarh, Maharashtra in western India and Bihar and West Bengal in the east.

"The incubation period can stretch from five years to 15 before the first signs become detectable. And by then, many others could become infected," said P.K. Gopal of the National Forum of Persons Affected by Leprosy, a nongovernmental organization working with leprosy patients.

The government is stepping up its fight against the disease, assigning additional health workers to 209 districts seen as high endemic areas in 16 states. But that won't end the pain and stigma that leprosy brings to patients and their families.

"Our children shouldn't have the shadow of leprosy hanging over their lives," said G. Venugopal, one of the elders at Kasturba Gram, as he sat outside his home under Delhi's weak winter sun.

In the world's worst outbreak since Ebola's discovery in 1976, more people died in Liberia than any other nation, as the disease swept through densely populated neighborhoods of Monrovia, the capital.

Patients often mistook their symptoms for typhoid or malaria and tragically delayed seeking treatment, infecting members of their families.

Treatment facilities were swamped with cases, and patients often died in terrible circumstances at the gates of treatment centers because there was no room inside to treat them safely.

Taxis ferrying sick passengers for treatment may also have spread the disease.

To help stop the spread of the virus, schools were closed and public gatherings were banned. Ambulances struggled to reach patients in time. In some cases community members left bodies in the streets; in others, family members carried their loved ones to hospitals in wheelbarrows.

MIAMI — Once again, Christina Morua found herself in the South Dade Library longer than she would like on a school night. The 28-year-old single mom sat in the bustling children's section on a recent Thursday, waiting for her fourth-grader to get on a computer and start some online math homework.

"We don't have any Internet at home," Morua said as her oldest, 11-year-old Abel, clicked through an assignment on a library laptop while Alina, 9, waited for her turn at a desktop. "We just reserved a computer. We have to wait 70 minutes. He got one of the last laptops."

"The laptops we do have, the batteries aren't working," said Patricia Readon, a librarian working the children's desk at the South Dade branch in Cutler Bay. "You can check out a laptop, and the next 30 minutes it's dead. The sad part is, if you don't have a computer, you can't do your homework."

Yet for families without access to online homework, libraries are already the place to be on school nights. It's just the lack of computers that has them complaining.

Miami-Dade's school system discourages teachers from assigning online homework if all students in the class don't have access to the Internet after school, said Sylvia Diaz, assistant schools superintendent for innovation.

"We really shouldn't be requiring kids to go to the library to complete assignments," Diaz said. "A project or something special is OK, but not daily homework assignments that are dependent on computer use."

Then she saw the Teen Tech Center at the Minneapolis Central Library. This digital playground, which opened in 2013, has rows of new computers, iPads, the latest video equipment and even its own soundproof recording studio.

"Growing up, I used to be super into reading. That's what I thought libraries were for," said Yakob, 18, of Minneapolis. Now she's a member of the Teen Tech Squad at the library, helping her peers with all sorts of high-tech resources, learning as she goes. "It gives me access to tools I don't have at home."

Shhhhhhh. You may not know it, but libraries have quietly become community tech hubs where the digital tools go far beyond computer terminals with free Internet. Across the metro area, their offerings are expanding as libraries help patrons tinker with 3-D printers, e-readers and social media. A growing catalog of e-books and e-magazines, combined with other online tools, extend resources far beyond the library walls.

Library patrons wouldn't have it any other way.

At the most basic level, library users value Internet access almost as highly as books, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. Eighty percent of library-goers surveyed said the ability to borrow books was "very important." A nearly identical amount said free Internet access also was a "very important" library service.

"They come and ask me for e-book help. They usually end up with a little bit more," Anoka County library services assistant Andrea Egbert said of the litany of tech-related quandaries that library patrons bring to her. Some walk in with new e-readers, still in the box, unsure how to switch on the devices. Job seekers ask for help formatting resumes. Others ask how to share photos and videos online.

Italian and Maltese vessels were searching the area, along with merchant ships, officials said.

Authorities said passengers were believed to be from Algeria, Egypt, Somalia, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Zambia, Bangladesh and Ghana, and included 200 women and 40 to 50 children.

According to a police statement, the unidentified Bangladeshi survivor said many passengers were locked in lower decks and unable to escape when the boat capsized. With so many people crammed onto the boat, it would have taken little to unbalance the ship.

Most migrants on the Mediterranean boats are from sub-Saharan Africa, but their ranks include Syrians and others escaping warfare and poverty and hoping to start new lives in Europe. Many women and children are among those risking the hazardous passage.

Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, speaking at an event in northern Italy, declared that Europe was experiencing "systematic slaughter in the Mediterranean." Whether the latest incident would result in a new European strategy to confront the crisis remained unclear. However, several European leaders said the status quo was unacceptable.

"Europe can do more and Europe must do more," said Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament. Europe must mobilize "more ships, more overflights by aircraft," French President Francois Hollande told French TV, The Associated Press reported.

Before the latest incident, about 900 migrants had already perished in Mediterranean crossings so far this year, compared with 96 during the first four months of 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration, a Geneva-based group.

"Star Wars"-themed shirts were everywhere. A teen girl had one that read: "Physically, I'm here, mentally I'm in a galaxy far, far away."

Liberal scholars began viewing Lincoln as "unfortunately linked to the warfare state and so Vietnam and other factors entered into this declining adulation," Fox said.

Medford said that today, many black Americans "understand the complexity of the man and are understanding more what Lincoln was about, why he did what he did" as a leader in a more overtly racist era in American history.

LOS ANGELES — Humans speak many languages, but we may be united in our confusion. A new study examined languages from around the world and discovered what they say could be a universal word: "Huh?"

Researchers traveled to cities and remote villages on five continents, visiting native speakers of 10 very different languages. Their nearly 200 recordings of casual conversations revealed that there are versions of "Huh?" in every language they studied — and they sound remarkably similar.

While it may seem like a throwaway word, "Huh?" is the glue that holds a broken conversation together, the globe-trotting team reported Friday in the journal PLOS ONE. The fact that it appears over and over reveals a remarkable case of "convergent evolution" in language, they added.

"Huh?" is a much-maligned utterance in English. It's seen as a filler word, little more than what's called a conversational grunt, like "mm-hmm." But it plays a crucial role in conversations, said Herbert Clark, a psychologist at Stanford University who studies language.

Little Free Libraries are handcrafted structures full of books for children and adults, a free-books movement that has spread not only around Illinois but onto lawns around the world. They are designed and decorated to the owner's — or steward's — taste, and stand on lawns, in parks and gardens, even in coffee shops where passers-by of all ages can "take a book, leave a book." Generally they hold 20 to 100 books.

According to the Little Free Library website, littlefreelibrary.org, there are about 60 stands registered in Illinois, with eight in Chicago and about 25 in the suburbs.

Just because you take a book doesn't mean you have to leave one, Brooks said. Most people do so in order to maintain a variety of books in the library and keep the circulation of the books flowing.

SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. — More than six decades after Kathryn "Tubby" Johnston Massar cut off her braids, tucked her hair under her cap and became the first girl to play Little League baseball, she's delighted to see two girls in the Little League World Series.

"It's truly amazing. I'm very happy to see girls playing," said Massar, 78, of Yuba City, California.

Humans are what are called tidal breathers. When we breathe in, fresh air moves into our lungs along progressively smaller airways, eventually ending in little sacs called alveoli, where our bloodstream picks up oxygen and deposits carbon dioxide. Then the "old" air moves out of our lungs along the same path it came in.

"The fact that only one part of the bird lung was dark suggested the air was flowing in one direction and that the first part of the lung to receive the contaminated air was filtering the particles," said Colleen Farmer, an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah.

It isn't that surprising that birds have developed a more efficient breathing system. Scientists hypothesize it may have evolved to help them support their high metabolic rates, or to help them survive when they fly at high altitudes, where oxygen is scarce.

An East End cafe that serves 120 varieties of breakfast cereal — along with 30 kinds of milk — has become a surprising flashpoint for protest in a city increasingly polarized between rich and poor.

The Cereal Killer Cafe has drawn both derision and big crowds since it opened nine months ago, offering a cornucopia of flakes, pops and puffs from about 3 pounds ($4.50) a bowl. On the weekend, it attracted the ire of anti-gentrification protesters, who surrounded the business with flaming torches and scrawled "scum" on its windows as customers sheltered in the basement.

Tucked beside fossils of long-gone gigantic sloths and knee-high horses stands a newcomer to the American Museum of Natural History's extinction parade: Lonesome George, the last known Pinta Island giant tortoise.

Sterling had recommended Dante for the job. "After I had my 24 hours of sadness and self-reflection, I realized the museum could and had the resources to make a difference," she says. Dante had done the taxidermy restoration work on 2.5-meter-tall Alaskan brown bears and other creatures for the museum's North American Mammal Hall in 2012. Preserving George would be his biggest challenge since that project.

The bombshell announcement Tuesday by the museums raises the question of why it has taken them nearly 70 years to examine their collections in a systematic way after World War II — and suggests that even more looted art may emerge from other countries that haven't yet done so.

The tainted art involved 69 paintings, including French artist Henri Matisse's 1921 "Odalisque" painting of a half-nude reclining woman, which hangs at Amsterdam's Stedelijk Museum, one of the country's top tourist draws.

Other paintings included works by old Dutch masters such as Jacob Cuyp, Impressionist Isaac Israels and Modernists like Wassily Kandinsky. Other pieces uncovered in the investigation included drawings — one by Paul Klee — sculptures, antiquities and Jewish ceremonial objects.

One painting by Cuyp had been purchased in good faith by the Museum of Dordrecht in 2002. The 1627 painting "Shepherdess with Child in a Landscape" had changed hands multiple times over decades before the latest Dutch investigation revealed it had belonged to a Jewish woman and was sold by a bank known for collaborating with the Nazis during the war.

The Dutch are not the first to undertake such a review in the wake of a 1998 international conference on looted art in Washington that found previous attempts to return looted art didn't go far enough. Attendees from 44 nations proclaimed the Washington Principles, declaring that "every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis" and have it returned.

Critics wondered what took so long

But some countries are less willing than others. Russia rejects the Washington Principles, saying art taken during World War II are its rightful "trophies." Switzerland endorses the principles in theory, but has not conducted systematic research and turns a blind eye to the possibility of looted art hidden in its bank vaults, Marinello said.

The Dutch Museums Association launched a website Tuesday to publish its findings so far, solicit more information about looted artwork and assist heirs in filing claims. An English translation of the Dutch website is coming in 2014.

Investigator Ekkart acknowledged it's still possible that more looted artwork will be uncovered in the Netherlands. He said the museum's research was not exhaustive and new research strategies — such as the website — will lead to new findings. In addition, there are likely pieces still held in individual's homes that will be eventually detected.

But "you'll never again have a hundred at once," Ekkart said. 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A verdict in the city of Jacksonville is again raising the issue of self-defense and race in Florida, just seven months after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting of a black teenager, Trayvon Martin.

Following an argument over loud music coming from the car that Davis was in, Dunn said he shot at the car with his 9 mm handgun — he said he was afraid and thought he saw a shotgun in the car.

LOS ANGELES — This month marks the 40th anniversary of the discovery of Lucy, the partial skeleton of an apelike creature that walked upright 3.5 million years ago. The 1974 find would forever change humanity's understanding of where our species came from and how Homo sapiens evolved.

These days, Johanson serves as the founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. He spoke to the Los Angeles Times about Lucy's impact on paleoanthropology and what he hopes to find next.

We also have geological deposits throughout Africa that have not been thoroughly examined and I think new discoveries will be made and be surprising.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Hickman Mills school nutritionist Leah Schmidt has always loved solving that puzzle of serving up healthy meals that nose-wrinkling children actually will eat.

Another rule would make it so children must pick up a fruit or vegetable with each meal, rather than just expecting servers to strongly encourage it. Schools fear it will lead to food waste.

Dobbs fifth-grader Cree Crook said she thinks her school's lunch team has done fairly well satisfying her and her classmates. The whole-grain movement has taken regular macaroni and cheese out of the mix. (Whole-grain pasta just doesn't work with that kid favorite, Schmidt said.) But that's OK, said Cree.

Cree said she thinks children are getting the message. She knows to get tomatoes and lettuce in her taco salad. She's learned to like green beans.

"She would call me almost daily, 'Mom, I have nobody to eat with, and the girls don't want me to sit with them,'" Talmus said, who said her daughter would finish her lunch and call her from the restroom crying. "Lili was never teased or bullied, but was almost suffering as much because she felt invisible."

"I would much rather sit alone than with people I don't know, to be honest," said Cori Caby, a seventh-grader who was at a table with some students she usually sits with and some she doesn't.

CHICAGO — November was Lung Cancer Awareness Month, but you'd never know it. Consumers aren't bombarded by products in blue, the color designated by some to raise the profile of the disease. No NFL players or coaches wore blue-ribboned apparel, despite donning pink just a month earlier for breast cancer.

The lack of buzz is especially perplexing because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, claiming more lives than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. The five-year survival rate is just 16 percent — a statistic that has barely budged since 1975, according to the American Cancer Society.

But lung cancer is seen as a tobacco-related illness that patients somehow bring upon themselves.

Not that it's easy to build awareness. Forget the pink marketing blitz; just try to find a ribbon for lung cancer. There's even dispute over the appropriate color, according to Andrea Ferris, president and chair of the LUNGevity Foundation, who says it's blue. Others say it's clear or pearl.

Even so, O'Brien immediately recited her virtuous health habits: Physical education teacher. Avid tennis player. An "almost vegetarian" who hasn't rolled through a fast-food window since age 13. No cigarettes, ever.

OK — now continue.

If you were one of the countless children who have been mesmerized by the classic picture book "Madeline," you can.

Word for word, page by page, through the story of the little girls who left the house at half past 9, in two straight lines, in rain or shine, the smallest and most fearless one being Madeline.

"Madeline" was published 75 years ago. The Chicago Public Library is marking the anniversary with "Madeline" birthday parties at six libraries in October and November, and with activities and a costumed "Madeline" character at the Bookamania children's book fair on Nov. 22 at the Harold Washington Library.

But some of us have been celebrating "Madeline," and other special books of our childhoods, all along, by passing our love of these classics on to our own children.

Books like this pack serious power. You don't just read them. You reread them, again and again, the words drumming into your memory so strongly that after 50 years, they are still there.

and closed the door —  

there isn't any more._

Childhood books feel utterly real, even if they are populated by talking animals. For years I was sure I had personally witnessed the last scene in Margaret Wise Brown's "Wait Till the Moon Is Full" — that I had seen the raccoon child playing ball with his raccoon and rabbit friends while their raccoon and rabbit mothers knitted and chatted under the full moon's light.

I wanted my daughters to see it too. So when they were young I started reading that book and my other childhood favorites to them.

It turned out that I still loved them. So do other parents passing along their beloved books. A friend of mine recalls watching her husband reading "Little House on the Prairie" to their 7-year-old son. The boy was asleep; her husband was still reading to him.

The transfer of book affections doesn't always work. Mothers of sons sometimes face a challenge getting their boys to like their childhood books about, say, horses.

And some books are simply hard to bring into the modern era. A friend of mine tried three different times to introduce her sons to "Winnie the Pooh," which she adored as a girl but finds slow going today.

"I really sold it," she sighed, "but it didn't take."

My daughters turned out to be an eager audience for my childhood favorites.

"Madeline," "Wait Till the Moon Is Full," "The Story of Babar" — they happily listened to them all, snuggling up to me as I had once snuggled up to my own mother.

Then it was on to my favorite chapter books — "Chancy and the Grand Rascal," "Knight's Castle" and, of course, "The Phantom Tollbooth," the Norton Juster classic illustrated by Jules Feiffer.

Night after night my husband or I read "The Phantom Tollbooth" to the girls, taking them on travels with Milo, the bored boy who receives a mysterious gift of a tollbooth that leads him into adventures rich with wordplay and characters like Tock the watchdog, whose body is a watch face.

The girls loved all of them, these books I knew so well they seemed tattooed into my memory.

So my older daughter had a couple of them tattooed onto her skin.

The little raccoon from "Wait Till the Moon Is Full" is inked on her right foot. The watchdog Tock from "The Phantom Tollbooth" is on her left shoulder.

It is high body art praise. And others of her generation have given similar pride of bodily place to images from books dating to their parents' childhoods.

Actress Lena Dunham has tattoos from "The Story of Ferdinand" and "Eloise." A recent BuzzFeed post of tattoos based on children's books included such classics beloved by baby boomers as "The Velveteen Rabbit," "The Little Prince," "Goodnight Moon," "Corduroy," "Winnie the Pooh," "The Phantom Tollbooth" — and "Madeline."

Labels warning that magnets are harmful if swallowed have not stopped an increasing number of kids from putting them in their mouths or noses and then getting them stuck in their bodies, where they can cause serious harm.

Magnets will work so hard to find each other that their force can cause intestines to twist and become blocked. The pull can also cause erosion, then ulceration, and eventually the intestine can perforate, causing infection, Mehta said.

Based on data Brown has seen since then, the problem shows no sign of slowing.

"There is something very tempting about them," Brown said. "When playing with this fidgety toy, you want to put it in your mouth. You want to try to separate the magnets with your teeth."

To toddlers, they look just like the silver-ball candies you put on cupcakes, she said.

Buckyballs, a set of 216 magnets that consumers can manipulate into sculptures and chain jewelry, is one culprit. Last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission asked retailers and makers of Buckyballs and Zen Magnets, a similar toy, to stop selling them.

But you can still find them online, said Brown, who has researched the issue and claims more than 3 million sets of the magnet sets have been sold. At 216 magnets per set, that's 600 million in circulation.

Other magnet-containing products are equally worrisome, she said, citing metallic bulletin boards that have little magnet pins, refrigerator magnets that look like candies or coffee beans (begging to be tasted) and fishing games that involve a magnet on a rod.

ABUJA, Nigeria — [Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), the Pakistani teen who survived a Taliban assassination attempt in 2012, marked her 17th birthday Monday with a visit to Nigeria and urged Islamic extremists to free the 219 schoolgirls who were kidnapped there three months ago, calling them her "sisters."

She described an emotional meeting Sunday with some of the girls' parents.

When the activists tried to march peacefully to the presidential villa in May, they were blocked by soldiers and police. Jonathan canceled a planned trip to Chibok that same month.

On Monday, he told Malala that criticism that his government is not doing enough "is very wrong and misplaced," according to a presidential statement.

"The great challenge in rescuing the Chibok girls is the need to ensure that they are rescued alive," he said, insisting his government is "very actively pursuing all feasible options" to achieve their safe return.

[Malala Yousafzai](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Malala), the 15-year-old girl who was shot in the head by the Taliban in October, resumed her education in March, enrolling in a new school in England.

Malala made a swift recovery from surgery that involved fitting a titanium plate to her skull and installing a cochlear implant to help her regain hearing in her left ear. After only five months in the hospital, she was strong enough to return to school and defy the Taliban, showing it will take more than a bullet to the head to keep her from getting an education.

"I am excited that today I have achieved my dream of going back to school," Malala said in a statement given to Time magazine. "I want all girls in the world to have this basic opportunity. I miss my classmates from Pakistan very much, but I am looking forward to meeting my teachers and making new friends here in Birmingham."

The teenage Malala is already well on her way. She initially gained recognition in Pakistan and beyond when she was only 12 by writing a popular blog on the BBC's Urdu-language website. She chronicled her experiences as a schoolgirl in the Swat Valley, a region of Pakistan then coming under Taliban control. The Taliban had issued an edict banning education for girls, and began bombing girls schools.

A surprising factor may be contributing to the spread of malaria in Malaysia, new research has found. In a new study, published Friday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, scientists argue that deforestation is causing environmental changes that have upped transmission of a form of the infectious disease usually found only in monkeys.

The attack Thursday afternoon killed 298 people from nearly a dozen nations — including vacationers, students and a large contingent of scientists heading to an AIDS conference in Australia.

President Barack Obama called for an immediate cease-fire between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russia separatists. He also called for a credible investigation.

"The eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out," Obama said at the White House.

Smashed watches and mobile phones, charred boarding passes and passports were among the debris.

Large chunks of the plane, which bore the airline's red, white and blue markings, lay strewn over one field.  The cockpit and one turbine lay a kilometer (a half-mile) apart, and the tail landed 10 kilometers (6 miles) away. One rebel militiaman in Rozsypne told the AP the plane's fuselage showed signs of being struck by a projectile.

The area has seen heavy fighting between government troops and pro-Russia separatists, and rebels had bragged about shooting down two Ukrainian military jets Wednesday in the region.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov dismissed Kiev's accusations that Moscow could be behind the attack.

So we know it ended up in the ocean. We just don't know why. What does that change, if anything?

For some families, only the recovery of a body will bring any semblance of closure. But the discovery of at least one part of the plane marks a step in that direction, said Angela Crawford, a senior manager with New Zealand agency Victim Support, which offers counseling services to those affected by air accidents.

WASHINGTON — The FBI is deploying agents and technical experts to assist in investigating the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jet, based on the American citizenship of three of the passengers aboard the lost flight, a top federal law enforcement official in Washington said Saturday.

Reflecting the chaos surrounding the siege, various death tolls were reported during the day. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said 19 people died - 18 in the hotel and one Malian soldier killed in the fighting.

The new fee and elaborate home for Santa are part of a trend in the Chicago area and across the country to make holiday displays grander at shopping centers, with the aim of bringing online shoppers back to malls.

If you're looking for hot spots of diversity, look to the Earth's warm, sweaty midsection. The tropical regions near the equator both produce new species faster and lose them more slowly, according to a study that analyzed the evolution and extinction rates of nearly all mammal species on Earth.

Right now, Sidor said, before carbon dating will be done, he figured the tusk was probably 22,000 years old, and maybe even 60,000 years old.

The state started the count in 1991 using aerial surveys by plane. But bad weather prevented counts during the last two years, said Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Brandon Basino. Biologists try to cover much of the state in just a few days to avoid double counting. This year, a team of 20 from 11 organizations counted 3,333 manatees on Florida's East Coast and 2,730 on the West Coast of the state the third week of February, Basino said.

"We thank all our people for supporting Madiba throughout the hospitalization with undying love and compassion. We also thank all for responding to the call to give Madiba the biggest birthday celebration ever this year. Happy 95th Birthday Tata Madiba!" he said, using the affectionate name South Africans use for Mandela. (Madiba is Mandela's clan name and Tata means father.)

As South Africa's first black president, the ex-boxer, lawyer and prisoner No. 46664 paved the way to racial reconciliation with well-chosen gestures of forgiveness. He lunched with the prosecutor who sent him to jail, sang the apartheid-era Afrikaans anthem at his inauguration, and traveled hundreds of miles to have tea with the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, the prime minister at the time he was imprisoned.

Manning's sentence means the 25-year-old former intelligence analyst could eventually walk out of prison as a free, albeit much older, man. He had faced what could have effectively been a life sentence.

The same judge who sentenced Manning, Col. Denise Lind, had also previously acquitted him on an aiding-the-enemy charge that carried a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.

Prosecutors had asked that Manning be sentenced to 60 years.

U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley Manning was found not guilty of aiding the enemy by a military judge on Tuesday, the most serious charge in the case surrounding the leak of hundreds of thousands of classified documents that sparked a debate over the balance between military security and the public's right to know.

Lind did not explain the reasoning behind her verdict, but said she would release detailed written findings, according to The Associated Press. News organizations calculated that the smaller sentences on the charges Manning was convicted of could still add up to roughly 130 years in prison.

On Twitter, WikiLeaks called the possible sentence: "Dangerous national security extremism from the Obama administration."

The sentencing phase will begin Wednesday at Fort Meade, Maryland.

The documents included information on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and U.S. diplomatic messages. The Web site also showed combat videos from an army helicopter gunship in which Reuters TV news cameraman and his driver were killed, among others.

One of the prosecutors, Army Major Ashden Fein, said that the documents Manning released could give the enemy a "playbook" of U.S. fighting techniques.

Even the not guilty verdict on that charge offered limited solace, given the lengthy sentence that Manning still faces.

"Despite the lack of any evidence that he intended any harm to the United States, Manning faces decades in prison. That's a very scary precedent," Elizabeth Goitein, a security expert at New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice said in a statement on the program's Web site.

The U.S. government is currently embroiled in another high-profile leak case.

National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden recently revealed efforts by the NSA to monitor American's cellphone and Internet traffic. Snowden is currently in a Russian airport as he tries to seek asylum to avoid facing U.S. criminal charges. The Guardian newspaper, one of the main outlets that received Snowden's leaks, reported that Snowden said that one of the reasons he fled the country was the way Manning was treated by the military.

WikiLeaks has never publicly admitted that Manning was the source of the documents it released on the war in Afghanistan in 2010. The huge document disclosure made a household name out of WikiLeaks and brought the international spotlight on its founder, Julian Assange.

"We call those types of people that are willing to risk ... being a martyr for all the rest of us, we call those people heroes," Assange told CNN this week. "Bradley Manning is a hero."
EAST HARTFORD, Conn. — For decades, aerospace manufacturers like Pratt & Whitney have fabricated engine parts by tooling, lathing, milling and forging.

Now, they're printing.

Instead of ink, these printers — called 3-D printers — use lasers to heat granules of plastic or metal to build up three-dimensional parts, layer by layer. The end product could be any solid design, however complex.

And for 3-D printing — also called additive manufacturing — the fact that the vanguard technology has passed through the testing fires of a jet engine is a good sign.

SANTIAGO, Chile — Nestled between high-rise buildings on a busy street in Chile's modern capital is a straw hut that's a sign of growing respect for the Andean country's long-disdained indigenous past.

"The Mapuche today are not just folklore. The Mapuche today are a cultural icon and a pop-cultural icon," said Pedro Cayuqueo, a Mapuche author and host of "KulMapu," a popular TV show profiling everything Mapuche that is broadcast on CNN Chile. "It makes people in rock, film and gastronomy become interested and stop looking at the Mapuche in a paternalistic way, but as something that's cool."

VOZ, a New York fashion design company, works with Mapuche artisans in Chile and sells their hand-woven designs as far away as Asia and the Middle East. They've been displayed in Los Angeles and Paris and during New York Fashion Week.

The Mapuche work "is so beautiful and so expertly crafted," said VOZ founder Jasmine Aarons. "And the stories that the Mapuche artisans tell in their artwork is so powerful, like their culture."

"What's happening shows that Mapuche people have a lot of wisdom to share," said Mapuche leader Hugo Alcaman. "We're proud of being indigenous because we know of the wisdom that we have to offer to the world."
Twin bomb blasts exploded at the finish line of the Boston Marathon Monday, killing three people, wounding scores of others, and renewing fears that American cities are vulnerable to deadly terror attacks.

The explosions occurred amid a crowd of spectators who were cheering as fatigued runners lurched toward the finish line around the four-hour mark. The two blasts, spaced just 12 seconds and one block apart, sprayed pellets and nails, sent debris flying, ripped apart limbs, ruptured eardrums and sent people scrambling. Five thousand runners who had not finished the race had to be diverted.

Among those killed was Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy who had watched his father race in the marathon. The other victims were a 29-year-old woman and a Boston University student from China. Boston hospitals reported that many victims had severe leg injuries. The total number wounded topped 180.

## Gathering Clues, Asking For Videos And Photos

"It should be offered with the same amount of weight," she said. "It just needs to be recognized as the legitimate art form that it really is. The key was to take mariachi from being an out-of-school thing and put it into the school day."

Sebastien, who is known as El Charro de Oro – or the boy with the golden voice - sang the National Anthem, a notoriously tricky song, before the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat tipped off. He was dressed in a silver and black mariachi outfit.

Sebastien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC's "America's Got Talent" for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem, according to CNN.

POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE, Calif. — The once-bustling oyster farm and sales shack at the end of the dirt road had the look of sudden abandonment.

Doors and windows gaped open. Wind-chapped buildings were stripped of everything that was valuable or could be resold to other oyster operators. Inside, the commercial detritus of the former owner cluttered mud-caked floors: a shopping cart, fishing poles, plastic gloves, bottles of condiments, office chairs.

In the clear waters of Drakes Estero, where decades of farmers had groomed crops of sought-after oysters, flecks of yellowed plastic foam broken off a timeworn floating barge bobbed like misplaced snowflakes.

It's the aftermath of a yearslong legal battle between the oyster farmer and the National Park Service, which fought to reclaim and restore the bay. The park service prevailed — after spending millions of dollars in scores of lawsuits that ended at the U.S. Supreme Court.

The park is now undertaking an uncommon enterprise — returning a working landscape to its primitive state. It's expensive work that must be completed before the West Coast's first marine wilderness can be unveiled to the public.

The Estero's 2,500 acres are a natural refuge for seals, which are believed to have moved to other areas to avoid the oyster farm's regular motorboat traffic.

Wildlife biologist David Press said that he doesn't expect the seal population to suddenly increase because of the reversion to wilderness, but that the distribution of seals may change and they might come back to the Estero.

VIRGINIA CITY, Nev. — One wonders what Mark Twain himself would make of the news: The Gold Rush-era newspaper for which he once penned stories and witticisms on frontier life as a fledgling journalist is once again in print after a decadeslong hiatus.

Even the Enterprise's new editor, Elizabeth Thompson, guesses that Samuel Clemens would have a field day.

"I don't think he could resist with some witticism about the many attempts to resurrect the paper over the years," she said. "He'd have something to say. He'd get a kick out of it."

With a daily circulation of 15,000 at its peak in the 1860s, the Enterprise was Nevada's first newspaper and the largest west of the Mississippi, as it chronicled the frenzy and financial fallout of the Comstock Lode of silver ore discovered on the eastern slope of Mount Davidson.

After the mining boom died, the paper continued to tell the story of a rough town where unwashed men settled scores with six-shooters. The original Enterprise ceased publication in 1893, along with an economy of words in its epitaph: "For sufficient reasons we stop."

Clemens had traveled west from Missouri with his brother, Orion Clemens, who became secretary of the Nevada Territory before the area achieved statehood in 1864. Historians say Clemens first used the pen name "Mark Twain" while at the Enterprise.

Mars' geologic history is inscribed in its layers of sedimentary rock, and Curiosity set out to read it after landing in Gale Crater in August 2012. The rover's primary goal was to search for life-friendly environments at Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-high mound whose clay-rich layers could reveal details about Gale's environment over the eons.

The rocks, dated to roughly 3.6 billion years ago, have turned up a smorgasbord of elements needed for life, including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus. They also show signs of sulfates, sulfides and other compounds that would have been fuel for chemolithoautotrophs.

Most likely, the lake would have been "suitable for quite a wide range of microorganisms as opposed to just extremophiles" that can survive salty, acidic environments, said David Catling, a planetary scientist at the University of Washington who was not involved in the new studies.

Curiosity has not yet found any organic carbon, the type that's combined with hydrogen and is a mainstay of life on Earth. That may be because its inner lab cooks soil samples to analyze the gases they form, and the test winds up destroying some crucial information in the process.

A series of discoveries from NASA's Curiosity rover are giving scientists a picture of Mars that looks increasingly complex, with small bits of water spread around the surface and an interior that could have been more geologically mature than experts had previously thought.

Sure enough, Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars instrument cooked up a tiny sample in its little oven and found that roughly 1.5 percent to 3 percent of the soil was made of water. The scientists think this water may have come from the atmosphere, pulled out of the thin air.

MILWAUKEE — Two University of Wisconsin-Stout professors are taking their students to Mars.

"I want them to be interested in science and have it be accessible," Little said of the students in her class whose only real-world experience with soil science someday may be growing vegetables and composting.

BALTIMORE — Laura Smith-Velazquez is a dreamer — and she has been dreaming of going to space since the first time she looked into a telescope as an 8-year-old, later imagining herself commanding a starship while watching "Star Trek."

But now, the 38-year-old engineer's chances of getting to space may have improved — the Owings Mills resident is one of 100 semi-finalists named last month by Dutch organization Mars One for a mission to establish a permanent colony on Mars by 2025. She said she is prepared to leave behind her husband of three years, who also applied for the one-way mission but didn't make the first cut.

NASA has announced new evidence that could confirm the presence of liquid water on the Red Planet, increasing the possibility that astronauts journeying to Mars could rely on the planet's own water for their drinking needs.

Ojha and his colleagues used the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to check out the chemical composition of the wet-looking streaks. They used a technique called spectroscopy, which keeps track of what spectra of light an object absorbs in order to make conclusions about its composition. With this technique, scientists can identify glass, ice and other substances from miles above the surface.

LOS ANGELES — Planetary scientists dream of sending a geologist to Mars to study its rocks by hand. Until then, they have to settle for examining meteorites — chunks of the Red Planet that land on Earth after hurtling through space and surviving the searing fall through our atmosphere.

In a paper last month in the journal Nature, an international team of scientists sought to sort out this issue for a particular group of meteorites known as shergottites. Martian space rocks tend to be very old, but shergottites are generally thought to be remarkably young — forming as a result of volcanic activity about 150 million to 250 million years ago, around the same time that dinosaurs roamed during Earth's Jurassic period.

If so, shergottites are a sign that Mars might have been geologically active fairly recently, and thus perhaps still amenable to some form of life, said Munir Humayun, a planetary geochemist at Florida State University who was not involved in the study.

In the Mojave, all this work is taking place in a massive trailer and requires a team of scientists. If it's ever used on Mars, the technology is going to have to be roboticized and shrunk to a fraction of its current volume.

Hahn, vice president of organizational development, said that the poor scores on his company's math test have been evident for the past six years. He also sits on an aerospace workforce training committee and said that most other Washington state suppliers in his industry have been seeing the same problem.

Indeed, in working with machinery and making products with precision, "people really do need a basic understanding of math," she said.

CHICAGO — Robert McDaniel was puzzled when the Chicago police commander dropped by his West Side home unannounced last month. The visit was cordial, but Barbara West's message was clear: Don't commit any more crimes or face the consequences.

A vanguard of math instructors is embracing ideas developed by two Stanford professors to reform math instruction. Their approach includes more visual and creative exercises, discussions of ideas and procedures rather than a focus on memorization and speed, and individually tailored lessons.

But some of the subtleties of the experience may be lost to posterity if it is not also noted that Garcetti, like his predecessor, Antonio Villaraigosa, speaks a version of the language that, for lack of a more scientific term, might be called Funky American Business Spanish.

Villaraigosa and Garcetti have Latino roots, but both had to learn much of their Spanish in school, on the stump or on the job. As a result, they speak a serviceable but far from perfect Spanish, a shortcoming each has acknowledged with humility and admirable good humor. During a 2009 visit to Mexico City, Villaraigosa referred to himself, self-deprecatingly, as "el pochito" — "pocho" being slang for an Americanized Mexican who may not speak Spanish well.

On Tuesday, Garcetti, whose paternal grandfather was born in Mexico, referred to his language skills as "good community meeting Spanish," much of which, he said, was refined while he was representing LA's heavily Spanish-speaking 13th City Council District.

At a news conference Monday at the Industrial Club of Mexico, the mayor ably fielded questions in Spanish, holding forth on the two cities' shared challenges and his mixed Jewish-Latino heritage. His answers were also peppered with the kinds of little mistakes that his 11th-grade Spanish teacher at the private school now known as Harvard-Westlake, where he began studying the language, would have marked, lightly, in red pen.

At one point, he appeared to have invented a word: "agrecimiento," to mean "acuerdo," or "agreement." Moments later, he stuck the English word "between" in the middle of a Spanish sentence. Later, making a reference to the "social fabric," Garcetti said what sounded like the "fabrica social" (in Spanish, "el tejido social"), which could be translated as "the social manufacturing plant."

Will the next egg you crack come from a chicken raised in a roomier barn?

Since California passed a measure requiring more space for egg-laying hens in 2008, Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Michigan and Ohio have enacted laws regulating hen housing, while activists in Massachusetts have launched a similar measure aimed at the 2016 presidential ballot.

"The McDonald's announcement really settles the debate as to whether there will be a future for cage confinement in the egg industry — the answer is no, there won't be," said Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm animal protection for the Humane Society of the U.S. "How quickly that will happen is now the real question."

Glenn Hickman, though, isn't waiting to debate the merits. The Arizona-based egg producer, an indirect supplier to McDonald's, responded to the announcement with plans to build a modern, 2-million-hen facility. Hickman, like other West Coast producers already in the California market, has been moving toward roomier enclosures since Proposition 2 passed in November 2008.

California's Proposition 2, which took full effect in January, doesn't stipulate enclosure sizes. It requires that hens have the ability to turn around freely, lie down, stand up and fully extend their limbs. The state Department of Food and Agriculture has since issued a rule requiring about 116 square inches per bird.

By December, 4 million of his projected 10 million laying hens will live in more spacious "enriched" enclosures with amenities such as perches, scratch areas and private areas to lay eggs. About 200,000 already are being raised organically in cage-free facilities, he said.

Craving a burger off a fast-food dollar menu? Chances are that it now costs more than a buck.

Customers are still reeling from McDonald's move last month to update its Dollar Menu, which for more than a decade offered burgers, fries and other items for less than a dollar apiece. The menu accounts for as much as 14 percent of the chain's overall U.S. sales.

But soon, the list will morph into what's being called the Dollar Menu &amp; More, which mixes the standard $1 items in with $2 goods and $5 shareable family meals designed to, as McDonald's puts it, "fill the need for choice, flexibility and other preferences."

The fast-food behemoth isn't the only one ditching the traditional dollar deal.

Rising costs and changing tastes are pushing prices past the buck barrier. In a quick-service market overrun with more upscale outlets and foodies seeking premium ingredients, the dollar deal may be doomed.

McDonald's says it will start giving customers the choice of a salad, fruit or vegetable as a substitute for french fries in its value meals.

McDonald's Corp. will roll out the change early next year in the U.S., where people will be able to pick a salad instead of fries at no extra cost. McDonald's says it already lets customers make such swaps in some countries, such as France.

But now it says it now work to make the options available in 20 of its biggest markets around the world, which represent 85 percent of sales. McDonald's, which has more than 34,000 locations around the world, said the change will be in place in 30 to 50 percent of the areas within the next three years and 100 percent the regions by 2020.

For Vietnam, McDonald's Corp. is turning to a partner with a uniquely American experience: Henry Nguyen, a private equity investor with a medical degree and MBA from Northwestern University who worked at the Golden Arches as a teenager.

Nguyen fondly recalls the french fries and hot fudge sundae he enjoyed on his first trip to McDonald's as a 4-year-old. Ten years later, he was making fries and working the front counter. "It's a love affair with the brand that started as a young boy," Nguyen said in a phone interview Tuesday from Australia.

Nguyen, 39, and McDonald's believe rising disposable income and a young, urban population in the country of 90 million will spell success for the company in its 119th market.

"This current young generation is Vietnam's golden generation," Nguyen said. "They will be the ones leading the market and economic development, the ones who are going to change consumption habits."

Nguyen said that while McDonald's has had difficulty translating its cuisine in other parts of Asia like Japan, where consumers aren't accustomed to touching their food, Vietnam was a French colony, and people there are used to bread and using their hands to eat.

And just because there isn't a McDonald's, Nguyen doesn't think consumers there have much learning to do.

Nguyen's bet is emblematic of a sea change underway in Vietnam, a country with which the United States shares a tragic history. The nation joined the World Trade Organization in 2007 and has eased restrictions on multinational corporations since then.

"It's a market we've wanted to get into, and one of the things was finding the right partner," said Mike Flores, vice president of global restaurant development at McDonald's. "It's also a market that long term, like all of our markets, we wanted to be fairly self-sufficient from a talent and supply chain standpoint, and I think we felt we had enough infrastructure geography that we could effectively get it off the ground and grow."

"I've had so many friends, colleagues and others ask, 'Why isn't there a McDonald's here?' " Nguyen said. " 'Do they think there's something wrong with Vietnam?' "

"Maybe people haven't caught on to chains," she said. "But you can also see there is a huge untapped potential to move in and claim that market share."

Disposable income has doubled in Vietnam since 2007, to nearly $1,000 per capita, Friend said, citing Euromonitor data.

Nguyen, who founded Good Day Hospitality, a corporation that will run his McDonald's franchise in Vietnam, has taken on an even more public life since marrying the prime minister's daughter.

He expressed some surprise at media reports that seemed to link his McDonald's deal to his family. He underscored that he's been talking with McDonald's about coming to Vietnam for more than a decade and said he was selected through a grueling search process, during which the burger giant sifted through hundreds of applications and interviewed more than 50 people or companies for the first franchise.

As the entrepreneur poised to introduce the Big Mac — and the drive-thru concept — to Vietnam, Nguyen said he understands he will face challenges, from nutrition issues to food safety to real estate and staffing. He was speaking from Sydney, where he and his restaurant team were going through training.

"I think about all of these challenges, and to me, it's exciting," he said.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court's historic ruling Friday granting gays and lesbians an equal right to marry nationwide puts an exclamation point on a profound shift in law and public attitudes, and creates the most significant and controversial new constitutional liberty in more than a generation.

Though the court's 5-4 opinion is tightly focused on the question of same-sex unions, its broad wording and soaring rhetoric will reverberate beyond the 20-year-long battle for marriage equality and almost surely lead to the striking down of any remaining laws that directly discriminate against people due to sexual orientation.

The president said that allowing gay couples to marry would strengthen communities by extending "the full promise of America to every American … This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts: that when all Americans are treated as equal, all are free."

Five children at a KinderCare Learning Center in suburban Chicago have been diagnosed with measles, Illinois and Cook County health officials announced Thursday.

SANTA ANA, Calif.—Struggling to contain a growing measles outbreak that started at Disneyland a month ago, Orange County health officials ordered about two dozen high school students without proof of immunization to stay away from campus.

Ethan Brown held up one of his ready-to-eat vegetarian chicken strips and peeled off stringy strands that mimicked the moist meat of the real thing.

"That's the beauty. That's absolutely everything," said Brown, founder of Beyond Meat, admiring the filaments of faux chicken at a cafe near the company's Southern California headquarters.

Soon after moving to Utah this summer, Rainbow Sky Buck ended up at the hospital with a painful ear infection. There, Buck learned she no longer had access to the free health coverage she had in California as a former foster youth.

"We really do feel an urgency about this," said Shadi Houshyar, vice president of child welfare policy at the organization. "So many people who have aged out have significant health needs, and coverage is so important. There shouldn't be an additional barrier."

But she worries that she might be left uninsured and unable to pay for medical treatment for eczema, allergies and fibromyalgia. "It is causing foster youth to be stuck in the same state they were raised in," said Martinez, who lives in Oceanside, California. "It is really stressing me out."

Buck said she decided to move to Sandy City, Utah, because of the limited job prospects in the small Northern California town of Crescent City. Before moving, she asked social workers about whether she would still qualify for free health coverage and was told that she would. Buck said she was shocked to learn otherwise.

She is no longer seeing a therapist for depression and said she is weaning herself off antidepressants because she can't afford them. Buck said she also worries about getting another ear infection and not being able to afford treatment.

"It is just scary to think I am completely on my own," said Buck, who recently got a job at an automotive shop but doesn't get insurance from her employer. "I don't want to leave, but this is almost forcing me to move back to California."
Carroll is familiar with manufacturers' indifference to security concerns. After he saw the insulin pump hacking demonstration, he contacted his own pump provider.

NEW YORK — Each morning, Brad Zupp puts on noise-canceling headphones and a pair of goggles, the lenses blacked out except for tiny peepholes that keep each eye focused downward. He sits at his desk, shuffles a deck of playing cards and gives himself 70 seconds to memorize the order.

Zupp then sets a timer and grabs another deck to see how fast he can duplicate the order of the shuffled cards.

His fastest time so far: 65 seconds.

But what's normal to Zupp and other contestants on the Memory Championship circuit can seem bizarre to those of us who habitually forget to buy milk at the store, who zone out on names at cocktail parties and who don't remember birthdays or anniversaries until the day has passed.

We don't meet a man named John and see a toilet. We don't kill time on the exercise bike memorizing every U.S. ZIP Code. We don't carry lists of 200-digit numbers and practice memorizing them while in line at the grocery store.

On a rainy Saturday in March, 65 of them gathered in a Manhattan office tower for the 17th USA Memory Championship, one of several such contests held each year around the world. For nearly eight tense hours, they scrambled to rearrange playing cards, match names with faces of strangers, recall random numbers, and memorize a 25-line poem and write it down word for word, with the exact punctuation and line breaks.

There were dentists, students, nurses, teachers, writers and magicians. They ranged in age from 16 to 50, and they seemed to have little in common beyond their passion for memorization and their strenuous training routines, which usually involve sitting in isolation for several hours a day practicing.

Most assign visual images to just about everything and create places in their minds to store those pictures, which serve as memory triggers.

When Yang needs to recall something, she envisions walking the path — which she models after a familiar place — and stopping at specific locations to retrieve the correct cookie crumbs.

Images, when tied together, can lead to phantasmagorical sequences.

The first New York contest, in 1997, drew 18 contestants. The winner was Tatiana Cooley, a secretary who joined the competition minutes before it began. Last year, Ram Kolli, a business consultant from Los Angeles, beat the reigning champion, mountaineer Nelson Dellis, who had won the previous two years.

Other winners have included Ron White, a war veteran who prevailed twice and who has memorized the name and rank of every U.S. service member killed in Afghanistan; and Scott Hagwood, who competed after doctors warned that radiation treatment for his thyroid cancer could hurt his memory. Hagwood won four years straight from 2001 to 2004.

PITTSBURGH — Teaching students alternatives to violence and improving their access to mental-health services are among the best ideas officials say they have for preventing the kind of bloodshed that has struck a long list of schools, including Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania.

But they say progress on arresting school violence nationwide has been hamstrung by a lack of funding, deployment of school-safety programs that haven't worked and a failure to properly train school staff and students.

"We're 15 years after Columbine, and you'd have thought we would have solved that problem," John Matthews, executive director of the Texas-based Community Safety Institute said, referring to the 1999 rampage at a Colorado high school in which seniors Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold fatally shot 12 students and a teacher and injured about 20 others before committing suicide.

A new Vanderbilt University study suggests that teaching younger students conflict-resolution skills — to think before they act — could be more effective than other techniques for reducing violence.

Before the study, the students completed questionnaires regarding their beliefs about violence and ability to manage volatile situations. Over several weeks, students used role-playing to learn how to avoid violence at heated moments, such as when one student calls another a name or hits on a peer's girlfriend.

Sethi said the exercises helped students "build the machinery of understanding conflict and how it progresses and how to get yourself out of it."

On a second questionnaire, administered after the exercises, students reported that they were less likely than before to be a target of bullying, less likely to hit or push others, less likely to cheer if a fight broke out and more likely to try to defuse a potential altercation. Some of the improvements were statistically significant, while others fell below that threshold.

Even if schools identify them as troubled, students often don't get the help they need, especially not on a consistent, long-term basis, Matthews said. He said Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people and himself during a 2007 shooting rampage at Virginia Tech, received care and monitoring at home.

"When he went to college, that was all out the door, and you saw that downward spiral," Matthews said.

MIAMI — After his father was diagnosed with cancer, a 15-year-old Champaign, Ill., teen started skipping school, erupting in angry outbursts, yelling at teachers and punching holes in walls or retreating to his room paralyzed by an overwhelming sadness.

As stories about increasing school violence dominate headlines, experts say many teens are struggling with untreated mental illness. However, even though federal health officials recommended universal mental health screenings for students nearly a decade ago, they still aren't required. An Associated Press review of policies around the nation shows screenings vary widely not only from state to state, but within each school district. There's no consistency on whether the schools screen, what age they screen and what they screen for.

MEXICO CITY — When the taxman calls, artist Teresa Cito doesn't wince. She knows the state isn't after a single peso.

An unusual program in Mexico allows painters, sculptors and other artists to donate part of their annual production of artwork to the state in lieu of paying taxes. The program, begun in 1957, has helped the government amass a huge collection of contemporary art. It's also left artists such as Cito content, free from worry about tax forms and audits.

"I walk in and see my work hanging or on pedestals. I think, 'How nice!' " Siegmann said, adding that she recalls seeing one in the boardroom of the Secretariat of Foreign Relations.

If the program has a fault, it may be that the state takes too much art, some of it of dubious quality that ends up gathering dust in vaults. Lopez Beltran said changes were in the offing to reduce the number of donations and to ensure they were of higher quality.

Of course, not every artist who makes a living from selling his or her work is endowed with prodigious talent. Mexico has plenty of artists who sell their work at park fairs or in markets. They, too, have a right to take part in the program even if the state finds itself swimming in work that might not belong in a museum.

Still, the overall collection contains works by some of Mexico's most renowned painters and sculptors.

MEXICO CITY — In a nation that has drawn international notoriety for drug cartel carnage, public officials are now focusing on another form of violence that plagues Mexican society: school bullying.

In recent weeks, President Enrique Pena Nieto railed against [bullying](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=bullying) during a visit to the troubled state of Tamaulipas, and Mexican celebrities joined a Twitter campaign, holding signs with the hashtag "#ElBullyingNoEsUnJuego," or "Bullying is not a game." On TV, disturbing images of children being bullied — one girl being grabbed by the hair, forced to her knees and ordered to beg for mercy — have played in a loop during TV news. And on June 11, Mexico's human rights commission announced that it would work with teachers as part of a national campaign to tackle bullying.

MEXICO CITY — Young Americans wanting to study in Latin America have stopped looking so intently at Mexico, which has dropped from first to fourth for U.S. students going to a university in the region over the last 10 years.

Only about 4,000 U.S. students now study in Mexico, with crime and drug violence being the main deterrent. More go to Costa Rica, Argentina and Brazil.

MEXICO CITY — Flip through the print publications exalting the activities of Mexico's high society and there's one thing you rarely find: dark-skinned people.

Mexico has strong laws barring discrimination based on skin color or ethnicity, but the practices of public relations firms and news media lag behind, promoting the perception that light skin is desirable and dark skin unappealing.

The issue came to the fore this month when a casting call for a television spot for Mexico's largest airline stated flatly that it wanted "no one dark," sparking outrage on social media and, ultimately, embarrassed apologies.

"It's the first line of evidence something had really changed here in terms of sea level," archaeologist Bob Carr said Tuesday at the Met Square construction dig on Fourth Street where a team is excavating a 2,000-year-old Tequesta Indian village in downtown Miami. The site will eventually be showcased in a towering entertainment complex — a compromise after a contentious debate last spring over preserving the city's ancient history.

Carr and his team discovered the submerged bricks, dating to the Civil War, about four months ago along a slice of old shoreline long buried a few feet deep under a parking lot. The find was not unexpected — Carr knew Fort Dallas occupied the site in the 1800s before famed industrialist Henry Flagler built his Royal Palm Hotel and lush gardens at the end of the 19th century.

Workers digging in units across the site have gradually excavated soil and sediment to reveal a sloping bank. They have found turtle bones, conch shells fashioned into shovels and shards of Fort Drum Punctate, a distinctive pottery used by the Tequesta.

Al Tompkins, a senior faculty member at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit school for journalism in St. Petersburg, Florida, said in a statement posted on the school's website that the hashtag campaign forces people and news organizations to re-examine how images are received and perceived.

CHICAGO _ As politicians in Washington took a step toward tightening the nation's gun laws on Wednesday, first lady Michelle Obama sat down with Chicago high school students whose stories about violence brought her to tears.

According to the students, the first lady wanted to know how many of them had been affected by the gun violence. Every one of them told her they had, said Ta'taleisha Jones, a 16-year-old who attended the meeting.

Nutrition advocates disagree over how to rein in food and beverage company practices that they believe contribute to obesity, including the roughly $1.8 billion spent each year on marketing to kids: Will companies respond to voluntary efforts or only to government pressure?

But some who see themselves as Obama's allies in the fight against obesity believe her desire to create partnerships with industry kept her quiet when her voice would have counted most. Fourteen companies that back Obama's anti-obesity campaign helped kill the voluntary advertising guidelines, lobbying reports and other records show.

"The White House got cold feet," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who had championed the guidelines. "It sort of undermines everything that the first lady was doing."

Since Obama launched "Let's Move!" in February 2010, White House officials have insisted that working with industry is the only way to achieve the first lady's goal of ending the epidemic of childhood obesity in a generation.

"Business and business leaders are a vital component of the solution," said Sam Kass, the executive director of Let's Move! and the first lady's senior policy adviser on nutrition. Obama declined a request for an interview.

In 2009, Congress approved a Harkin-sponsored measure to set up an interagency working group to write voluntary nutrition standards for products advertised to children. The White House monitored the group's progress, said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a brother of then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and a physician who helped develop the Let's Move! campaign. "A number of us at the White House were obviously interested in this," he said. So were the food and media industries. General Mills Chief Executive Kendall J. Powell met with White House officials, including senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. In a letter to the White House in September 2010, he argued that no evidence linked obesity to ads.

Powell suggested the working group should "be put on hold" while food companies improved the Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, a self-regulatory effort they set up in 2006.

The working group released draft guidelines in April 2011, acknowledging that its voluntary standards were ambitious: Foods advertised to children should have minimal levels of sugar, salt and fat, and make a "meaningful contribution" to diets by containing nutrients, they said.

The group proposed that its standards apply to all ads aimed at children 17 and younger. "A large percentage" of products advertised to children would not meet the guidelines, the panel noted, suggesting the standards be phased in over at least five years. Public health groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics embraced the guidelines, but food manufacturers, media companies and trade associations mounted a furious pushback.

Obama said progress since 2007 has included fast-food restaurants including apples and skim milk in its kids' meals, improved labeling to help parents choose healthier products in supermarkets, and higher standards for school lunches. "We've seen the progress we can make," the first lady said, "when we educate parents and we help them make healthier decisions."
WASHINGTON — Welcoming guests with the traditional Muslim greeting of "asalaam alaikum," first lady Michelle Obama announced a U.S. pledge of $70 million to help educate 200,000 adolescent girls in Pakistan.

Obama was accompanied Thursday by the Pakistan prime minister's wife, Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif, and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who praised the first lady's global effort to educate girls.

SEATTLE — Anand Mariappan spends his days at Microsoft building data-analysis tools largely designed for people like him. That is, office workers accustomed to high-resolution computer monitors, lightning-quick Internet and the creature comforts of a modern office park.

The program hasn't been without its flops. The flagship piece of its early days, a push to spur adoption of a low-cost, Windows-powered smartphone, "did not do so well," said Winnie Karanu, a program manager with Microsoft in Kenya. That effort coincided with Microsoft's global struggles to increase its tiny smartphone market share amid fierce competition from Google and Apple.

RAMALLAH, West Bank — When Sari Sakakini opened his ceramic-tiled Orjuwan deli in Ramallah's well-to-do Masyoun neighborhood, he hoped it would be the start of a global franchise of Palestinian food. A year later, that hope has dimmed.

Among the many who tried -- and failed -- to escape Nazi persecution: Otto Frank and his family, which included wife, Edith, and his daughters, Margot and Anne. And while the story of the family's desperate attempts ending in futility may seem remarkable today, it's emblematic of what a number of other Jews fleeing German-occupied territories experienced, American University history professor Richard Breitman wrote in 2007 upon the discovery of documents chronicling the Franks' struggle to get U.S. visas.

BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hundreds of migrants chanted defiant slogans outside Budapest's main international train station Wednesday as Hungarian police blocked them for a second day from seeking asylum in Germany and other wealthy European Union countries.

The 28-nation bloc has been at odds with itself for months on how to deal with the influx that has seen more than 332,000 migrants enter so far this year. Frontline nations like Greece, Italy and Hungary have pleaded for more help, while powerhouse Germany, which is expecting to take in 800,000 migrants this year, the most in the EU, has demanded that other nations step up and take in more asylum-seekers.

Hungary's police said they intend to reinforce their positions outside the Keleti terminal as the volume of migrants arriving from Serbia grows by the hour, with an estimated 3,000 already encamped near the station. Officers working with colleagues from Austria, Germany and Slovakia were searching for migrants traveling on Hungarian trains.

Kovacs also defended Hungary's 4-meter (13-foot) fence being built on the border with Serbia and the tougher migration laws it expects to enact in a couple of weeks. Those new laws allow authorities to fast-track decisions on asylum requests and make it illegal to cut through the fence or cross the border except at designated areas.

The Greek coast guard, meanwhile, said it had rescued 1,058 people in 28 Aegean Sea locations over the past 24 hours. More than 200,000 migrants have reached Greece this year, chiefly from neighboring Turkey, where more than 1 million live in refugee camps fueled by warfare in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Greek police also arrested six suspected smugglers in northern Greece after finding 103 migrants, including 19 children, hidden in a truck.

Called "al-Mushantateen," a play on the Arabic words for "suitcase" and "diaspora," the group includes posts by volunteers who offer services like calling the coast guard if a passenger on a dinghy sends a distress call. The advice covers the journey beyond Greece to Macedonia, Serbia, Hungary and Western Europe. Zaidah and his group already know which border points they will cross, hotels they can stay in and stores where they can get clothes more suitable for the fall weather as they head north.

WASHINGTON — Americans are heading South and West again in search of jobs and more affordable housing, as the nation's economic health continues to improve.

CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. — The days when "If the Marine Corps wanted you to have a family, it would have issued you one" are clearly over.

There is a new hospital, a movie theater, two florists, four dry cleaners, three "big-box" stores, 20 fast-food restaurants, and, because it's a military base, 13 barber shops and a commissary selling groceries for up to 30 percent less than at civilian supermarkets.

The Pentagon closed more than 350 domestic bases and other installations between the end of the Cold War and 2010 to save money and enhance efficiency. Many of their functions and personnel were consolidated into fewer, mostly larger bases that tend to be more isolated than the earlier constellation.

Communities that cluster around the largest bases — Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Fort Hood in Texas, Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state and Fort Benning in Georgia — are dominated by military personnel, reservists and retirees, many of them from multi-generational military families.

At the same time, some experts worry that the growing self-sufficiency of the mega-bases adds to the sense of a divided society.

Steve Erie, a political science professor at UC San Diego, says Americans revere the military — even if they don't join themselves. "From the civilian standpoint, the all-volunteer force appears to be working fine," he said.

The use of military-style equipment by even small-town police departments is the latest tactic to come under scrutiny.

This year, the Pentagon program is up for what would normally have been a noncontroversial renewal. An effort in the House to repeal it failed this summer by a lopsided 355-62 vote.

Friday, however, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said the program needed to be reviewed "to determine if equipment provided by the Defense Department is being used as intended."

They think anybody can enlist. Many see the military as a last resort in a tough job market — but always an option, the youth assume. Truth is, the Class of 2014 now leaving high school will face more difficulty qualifying for the armed services than ever in the 40-year history of the all-volunteer force.

Should Congress stick with defense funding caps enacted in December as part of a federal sequestration agreement, the Army over the next two years could shrink toward an active-duty force of about 440,000, its smallest since before World War II.

Today, 99 percent of recruits have graduated from high school. The military branches expect higher scores in the ASVAB test, which quizzes candidates on tools and electrical circuitry as well as on language and math. Even a past misdemeanor may disqualify a potential recruit.

In an interview on National Public Radio (NPR), General Martin Dempsey said, "I think it's fairly common knowledge that our population of military-age young men who qualify for the military is declining."

According to the NPR report, too many young men are disqualified from joining the military because they have had trouble with the law, lack a high-school diploma or have used drugs.

The military realized that if this trend continued, by 2020 there would not be enough male recruits to fill the ranks. So it decided it needed to increase female recruitment. By opening up ground combat roles to women, it's hoped the military can attract more female applicants by showing that women can have just as successful careers in the military as men.

Ground combat units, which include jobs like operating a tank or firing mortars, have been off-limits to female troops. The jobs are tough and dangerous, but serving in those units is often a requirement for certain leadership roles in the military.

Still, the plan to open ground combat jobs to women will not solve all the military's recruitment problems. Female soldiers and Marines must pass exhausting training courses and have superior fitness levels to be admitted to these units.

Fitness is yet another hurdle for would-be recruits. American youth are suffering from an obesity crisis. According to the Department of Defense, 27 percent of Americans aged 17 to 24 are too heavy to serve in the military.

When combined with the number of people who are disqualified for academic, criminal and drug-related reasons, only one in four young Americans is eligible to join the military. Not having enough recruits threatens U.S. military readiness -- the ability of the armed forces to respond to threats and accomplish their missions.

LOS ANGELES — On a soggy Granada Hills field, eight platoons stand at attention, poised to salute the American flag as it rises toward a cloudy morning sky.

The bugler lifts the brass instrument to his mouth and waits. A short delay betrays the illusion, but then a recording of "Reveille" blares out from stereo speakers as the flag moves up the pole.

Then the bleary-eyed middle and high school classmates march, mostly in step, toward their homerooms.

Each morning, four students — one representing each company: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta — stand watch over the front entrance of the school.

They eye the students, searching for flaws in uniforms, for closely cropped hair on the boys and tightly pinned-back hair on the girls. Colored nail polish is prohibited, but makeup is allowed in moderation. Any infraction constitutes a demerit, and each demerit lands a student 15 minutes of detention, which the school calls a "reboot."

At Branch Elementary in the Muroc Joint Unified School District, 60 percent of the students' parents are in the military.

"It's just sad to think that somebody is out there protecting our country, and at home their kids are going to a school with great teachers but with awful facilities," principal Dennison Winchell said.

Answering a question from a Marine in Sicily, Carter said, "You have to recruit from the American population. Half the American population is female. So I'd be crazy not to be, so to speak, fishing in that pond for qualified service members."

MILWAUKEE—A team of Wisconsin scientists has stitched together a dramatic 360-degree portrait of the Milky Way that reveals never-seen-before details of our galaxy.

PITTSBURGH — Earlier this month, on the national day of philanthropy known as Giving Tuesday, about 100 employees of Dick's Sporting Goods showed up at the Sarah Heinz House on Pittsburgh's north side to clean, paint and decorate for the holidays.

While millions of people worldwide marked Giving Tuesday by making online donations to charities, the group from Dick's — many of them millennials in their 20s and 30s — worked side by side at the Sarah Heinz House with middle-school students who participate in clubs, lessons and other activities at the nonprofit facility.

The researchers recruited nine nonprofits — including Rutgers and Otterbein universities, the University of North Carolina and WBEZ public radio in Chicago — and studied their marketing efforts leading up to Giving Tuesday and how they promoted it the day of the event.

Nonprofits that used digital-only campaigns limited to emails and social media posts "didn't get the highest response rate" from millennials, Feldmann said.

But when nonprofits linked Giving Tuesday to actual events, "they got the most heightened millennial response," he said.

At the University of North Carolina (UNC), for example, a student-giving council and a young alumni leadership council hosted on-campus Giving Tuesday events.

UNC created its own hashtag for the day, "#TarHeelTuesday," and encouraged students to volunteer with a student ambassadors program and to share their photos on Snapchat.

The university raised about $236,000 — far exceeding its goal of $150,000 — including about $23,000 from millennials who accounted for 29 percent of all donors.

"A combination of digital, grass-roots and self-organizing strategies for millennials to own that day and experience it first hand will get a good response," Feldmann said.

An evening event at the regional Toys for Tots storage facility was designed for families so that children could help their parents choose and pack toys designated for boys and girls in need.

"That's another trend: Millennials very much want their children involved," Hopkins said. "I get four or five calls a day from people looking for volunteer opportunities for kids as young as 5 years old."

The concept of linking philanthropy to hands-on participation in charitable causes isn't limited to millennials, though, she said.

John Della Volpe, director of polling at Harvard's Institute of Politics, said the findings suggest young people are genuinely interested in seeing real change in the criminal justice system — not just rhetoric.

It showed about 49 percent of millennials have little to no confidence that the judicial system can fairly judge people without bias for race and ethnicity. Another 49 percent have "some" to "a lot" of confidence in the judicial system.

Vaughn Gray recalled what changed for him. Over the past couple of basketball seasons, the former George Mason University (GMU) forward found he was able to "see the game slower ... react to things more efficiently" during contests.

That study, published last year, built on a nascent body of research into how approaches that emphasize mindfulness (defined in the study as "bringing conscious attention to the present moment in a receptive, curious manner") may prove to be more effective for athletes than traditional sports psychology.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140501_MINECRAFT.png" />CHICAGO — Seventh-graders at Northbrook's Maple School had just started learning about the Cold War when a handful of boys sat down at the school's library computers to cement their understanding of the subject.

A game like "Minecraft" might seem better suited for the rec room than the classroom, but more and more teachers are tapping its creative power to educate students in everything from history to engineering to biology.

"'Minecraft' is offering teachers a new type of learning experience, but the secret sauce is that kids are engaged," said Levin, whose company, TeacherGaming, has sold the "MinecraftEdu" version of the game to 2,500 schools worldwide. "They love it. They want to do it."

CHICAGO — When the Chicago Blackhawks take to the ice, Michelle Secor is dressed in her team paraphernalia and closely watching every faceoff, power play and goal, she said. "I was born and raised on the South Side so I have to cheer for our home teams," Secor said as she took a break from watching the Stanley Cup finals in a Bridgeport bar last week. "Bulls. Sox. Bears. Hawks. I was born into this."

The Blackhawks have three black players, the most of any NHL team: backup goalie Ray Emery, forward Jamal Mayers and defenseman Johnny Oduya. Dustin Byfuglien, an African-American from Minnesota, who the Blackhawks drafted in 2003 after he played AAA in Warrenville, also did a lot to make the sport appeal to young black fans.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Monday launched a private-sector program to promote opportunities for men and boys of color, decrying the "sense of unfairness and of powerlessness" that fuels such violent eruptions as the Baltimore riots and pledging to make equality a cause of his lifetime.

"We are in this for the long haul," Obama told a crowd at New York's Lehman College in the Bronx. "Sometimes there won't be a lot of fanfare. I notice we don't always get a lot of reporting on this issue when there's not a crisis in some neighborhood.

Yet the benefits from higher wages would be offset for many by a reduction in government benefits that low-wage workers now receive, such as child-care subsidies or public aid for food, housing and medicines.

An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last year estimated that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, which some lawmakers had proposed, would result in a half-million jobs lost. At $15 an hour, the hit would likely be in the millions.

COLUMBIA, Mo. — The president of the University of Missouri system resigned Monday with the football team and others on campus in open revolt over his handling of racial tensions at the school.

For months, black student groups have complained of racial slurs and other slights on the overwhelmingly white flagship campus of the state's four-college system. Frustrations flared during a homecoming parade Oct. 10 when black protesters blocked Wolfe's car, and he did not get out and talk to them. They were removed by police.

The Tigers' next game is Saturday against Brigham Young University at Arrowhead Stadium, the home of the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs, and canceling it could cost the school more than $1 million.

Head football coach Gary Pinkel expressed solidarity on Twitter, posting a picture of the team and coaches locking arms. The tweet said: "The Mizzou Family stands as one. We are united. We are behind our players."

COLUMBIA, Mo. — Missouri receiver J'Mon Moore decided to visit the protesters who had built a tent city on Carnahan Quad, demanding that the university pay attention to their complaints about racism.

Reporters had covered King's 55-minute speech at a high school gymnasium in Rocky Mount on Nov. 27, 1962, but a recording wasn't known to exist until English professor Jason Miller found an aging reel-to-reel tape in a town library. Miller played it in public for the first time Aug. 11 at North Carolina State University.

Most monarchs live only a little more than a month. But one generation each year lives seven or eight months, long enough to migrate to central Mexico before winter sets in, where the butterflies settle into a semi-dormant state, often clustering around the same fir trees as their forebears, perhaps drawn by chemical cues. In the spring, the monarchs return to the north, where they lay eggs on milkweed and die, giving way to a new generation.

KHOGNOO KHAN, Mongolia — Deep in a desolate, rocky canyon, about 10 miles from the nearest paved road and even farther from any power line, Altai Davaa and her brother, Tsagaana, eke out a simple life. They sleep in a traditional Mongolian yurt, cook over a wood-fire stove, burn animal dung for fuel and use an outhouse. Every morning, she milks her cows.

But when the sun starts to set behind the ruins of a small Buddhist monastery uphill from their encampment, Tsagaana grabs the power cord from his mini solar panel, plugs in his satellite dish and TV, and starts channel surfing. He gets more than 60 stations, offering everything from "Breaking Bad" to Hollywood blockbusters.

On that front, he's hardly starved for choice either. Despite having just 3 million inhabitants scattered over an expanse about four times the size of California, Mongolia has 138 homegrown television stations — 80 percent of them founded in the last 10 years.

They air everything from wrestling tournaments to news and political talk shows, real estate showcases, home shopping programs, the Miss World Mongolia pageant and even the Mongolian Academy Awards.

"It's just crazy," says Bayarmagnai Puntsag, co-founder of Mongolia's National Press Club.

Journalists' training is poor and pay is low; many stations accept payments to broadcast stories, or take protection money to keep critical reports off-air.

The suit was filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). It seeks a court order allowing PETA to administer all proceeds from the photos for the benefit of the monkey, which it identified as 6-year-old Naruto, and other crested macaques living in a reserve on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.

PHILADELPHIA — The University of Pennsylvania is at the forefront of a movement to experiment with free open online courses, but the undertaking, as its own researchers are finding out, has yielded mixed results.

While Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have attracted millions of viewers and been heralded as a potential way to address skyrocketing tuition, very few of their viewers — 4 percent on average — actually complete the courses, according to the latest study by researchers in Penn's Graduate School of Education.

Many who register drop off after the first week or two, the researchers found in a study they will present Thursday at a MOOC conference at the University of Texas, Arlington. About half who registered viewed at least one lecture.

The results come on the heels of another Penn study, released last month, that showed a vast majority of students enrolled in MOOCs already hold college degrees and are taking the courses primarily to advance in their jobs, which called into question the notion that the courses were providing greater access to the world's underprivileged.

The majority of MOOC users are doing it for leisure learning or job development, so it's not surprising that few finish, said Cathy Sandeen, vice president for education attainment and innovation at the American Council on Education.

The Salinan Indians say the dominant landmark on California's Central Coast may be climbed on dates prescribed by the heavens. The Northern Chumash believe it should never be tread upon, only appreciated from afar.

The feud entered the legal arena last December, when the tiny Northern Chumash Tribal Council filed a document in civil court arguing that the Salinan Tribe of Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties should not be allowed to "desecrate a registered Chumash Nation sacred site" and seeking proof of the Salinans' right to climb it.

CAIRO — A Cairo court sentenced ousted President Mohammed Morsi to death Saturday on charges of conspiring with foreign militants to break out of prison during Egypt's uprising four years ago.

In a study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to address the growing number of butterflies going extinct, Florida International University researcher Gary Rand found two common chemicals used in spraying were toxic to butterflies at amounts typically used to control mosquitoes. While researchers have long suspected pesticides killed butterflies, Rand's research documents lethal amounts and found that spraying may have lasting effects.

"It's not going to be easy," said Chalmers Vasquez, operations manager for Miami-Dade County Mosquito Control. "The population needs to be protected before the butterflies."

MIAMI — The drone, a powerful but controversial weapon against terrorism, is about to take on a new and seemingly inexhaustible enemy: the black salt marsh mosquito.

The [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), about half the size of ospreys commonly seen in the Keys, won't be equipped to spray or blast bugs. It will be rigged with a thermal camera designed to survey difficult-to-access mangrove jungles that are breeding grounds for the marsh mosquito, the most prolific biter in the island chain.

Dengue, which isn't well-known outside tropical regions, is on the rise worldwide, with outbreaks reported this year in Texas and Florida. The mosquito that carries the dengue virus has spread to 100 countries and potentially exposes 2.5 billion people to the excruciating disease, also known as bonebreak fever. Some 50 million to 100 million people contract dengue each year, of which about 25,000 die, the World Health Organization reports.

"A person with dengue will be prostrate for several days," said Dr. Carlos Galvez, the head epidemiologist for Panama's Health Ministry. "They grow dehydrated very fast. In a matter of hours, the cases can grow more complicated."

VATICAN CITY — Mother Teresa, the tiny, stooped nun who cared for the poorest of the poor in the slums of India and beyond, will be declared a saint next year after Pope Francis approved a miracle attributed to her intercession.

Last August, driven by the instinct to establish his own territory and find a mate, P-32, one of only a handful of male mountain lions left in the Santa Monica Mountains, navigated three freeways before being struck and killed by a vehicle, the 13th lion to die on a highway in the area since 2002.

DALLAS — Like many 20-somethings, Cole Leonard has reached a professional crossroads: Should he pursue a safe career? Or strive for a dream that may prove elusive?

But few of his peers face a choice this stark. He's deciding between becoming a lawyer or dying on the surface of Mars.

It's a difficult decision for the 27-year-old Plano, Texas, resident. Leonard has been accepted into law school at Texas Tech for the fall. But he is also one of 705 candidates vying to be part of the first human colony on Earth's neighbor.

The journey is being organized by Mars One, a nonprofit founded by a Dutch [entrepreneur](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) who insists it can be accomplished with current technology. The group began soliciting applications from potential colonists last year. More than 200,000 people signed up from around the world. The list will be whittled down to 24 by next year, organizers said.

Leonard has simpler worries, too. He can't study to become a lawyer and train to be an astronaut at the same time. And he's hesitant to give up law school for what may be a quixotic dream.

Take a Pew Research Center report last year that found 36 percent of adults ages 18 to 31 live in their parents' homes — the highest share in at least four decades. Higher, that is, than the 32 percent who lived at home in 2007, at the onset of the Great Recession. Higher than the 34 percent who lived at home in 2009, when the recession officially ended. Higher than the 32 percent who lived at home in 1968, the earliest comparable data available.

These are hardly the directionless layabouts we keep hearing about, says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, executive director of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood.

What they're not necessarily obtaining, however, is employment. The Pew report found that 63 percent of 18- to 31-year-olds had jobs in 2012, compared with 70 percent in 2007. Forty-five percent of the millennials living at home were unemployed.

"They (prioritize) purpose, meaning and self-growth in their careers," says Varda Konstam, a professor of counseling and school psychology at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and author of "Parenting Your Emerging Adult: Launching Kids From 18 to 29" (New Horizon Press). "That differs somewhat from previous generations."

At the University of Nottingham in Britain, researchers have rediscovered an ancient medicinal elixir that appears to fight a very modern scourge: a deadly drug-resistant bacterial infection rampant in hospitals.

The discovery melds medieval potion-making with modern pharmacology. In its crosshairs: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, better known as MRSA (pronounced mersa).

"We know that MRSA-infected wounds are exceptionally difficult to treat in people and in mouse models," said Kendra Rumbaugh, who performed the testing of Bald's remedy on MRSA-infected skin wounds in mice. "We have not tested a single antibiotic or experimental therapeutic that is completely effective," added Rumbaugh, a professor of surgery at Texas Tech University's School of Medicine. But she said the ancient remedy was at least as effective — "if not better than the conventional antibiotics we used."

CHICAGO — Geologist Erin Argyilan has in the last 10 months studied sediment, analyzed wind patterns and mapped terrain, but she hasn't solved the mystery of the holes that appear and vanish in the beige sands of Mount Baldy at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.

She is one of many experts who have combed the terrain for clues on the origin of these potentially dangerous holes, which are about a foot in diameter and seem to survive for less than a day before filling in naturally with sand. Investigators have used ground-penetrating radar and specialized GPS devices to peek below the landscape, but no one is entirely certain why the holes form along the surface of this landmark, which attracts thousands of visitors each year.

An explosive, lateral blast vaporized everything in a miles-long swath and leveled 230 square miles of forest. When the dust and ash settled, what was left was a horseshoe-shaped shell of a mountain with a few remnant snow fields clinging to its flanks.

But that shell provided a perfect nest to nurture a baby glacier.

Its northward orientation helped shield snow from the sun. A thick layer of loose, volcanic rock collected on the crater floor, providing an insulating barrier against volcanic heat rising from below. And when a magma dome began bulging upward — eventually growing nearly 900 feet high — it formed a sheltered niche along the crater's back wall where snow could pile up.

That report was written by Daniel J. Miller and his wife, Lynne Rodgers Miller. When she saw the news of the mudslide Saturday, she knew right away where the land had given way. Her husband knew, too.

LOS ANGELES — John Muir is the patron saint of environmentalism, an epic figure whose writings of mystical enlightenment attained during lone treks in California's wilderness glorified individualism, saved Yosemite and helped establish the national park system.

Christensen and others see Muir's beliefs as antiquated in the face of 21st-century environmental challenges that the bushy-bearded Scot could not have imagined: population growth, urban sprawl, demographic shifts, climate change.

The debate boils down to Muir's primary ethic: The wilderness is a temple to be left undisturbed, so man occasionally can experience nature in its purity. That precept helped shape a century of conservation, ensuring that there would be unspoiled wilderness for succeeding generations.

"He had a huge passion for nature, such as we should all cherish in our hearts," said Mary Ellen Hannibal, a Bay Area author and Muir devotee. "He holds up an ideal of experiencing nature firsthand in a spiritual, transcendent way."

Nature exists in many forms, they say. Pristine wilderness is but one.

Ancient Egyptians may have been concocting complex and effective mixtures to preserve their dead as far back as 4300 B.C., new evidence suggests.

Amen-Nestawy-Nakht, a 3,000-year-old Egyptian priest, was getting a CAT scan at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. It was probably his second. The last one was a couple of decades ago, when technology wasn't what it is now.

The St. Louis Art Museum (SLAM) hired a company of art movers to pick up Amen-Nestawy and two other mummies on Sunday, load them into specially made foam cases, truck them to the Siteman Cancer Center in the city's Central West End, and slide them onto gurneys. A team of Washington University professors, doctors and radiologists donated their time; Barnes donated its space and the 3-D X-ray scanners.

"This is really the best way to look at these mummies," said Michelle Miller-Thomas, a radiologist who specializes in head, neck and brain imagery. "There's no other way without unwrapping them and permanently damaging their remains."

By Sunday afternoon, the team had scanned Henut-Wedjebu and Pet-Menekh (who stunk — doctors weren't exactly sure what caused the odor), and wheeled Amen-Nestawy into C.T. 5.

But the mummy fit just fine into the circular scanner opening. The doctors crowded into the control room and stared at the computer. And then Amen-Nestawy's insides came up on the screen.

And as the giant machine scanned the mummy, and the computer displayed morphing Rorschach blotches in black-and-white, it picked up a circular object, in the middle of his chest, that robbers didn't get. Doctors said it looked like a two-centimeter-wide amulet.

Koretz, who represents parts of the Westside and parts of the San Fernando Valley, said his constituents have told him they don't support the mural ordinance. In addition to aesthetic concerns about the murals, residents worry that they will attract graffiti and become "God-awful eyesores," he said.

He said there were no mural regulations when he painted the McQueen piece. "We were a free country then," he said.

Murals exploded in Los Angeles in the 1970s as artists took to walls to express concerns about political and social issues, including nuclear energy, student uprisings, political upheaval in Mexico and Chile and the civil rights struggle at home.

"It was this instantaneous culture that happened in Los Angeles," Rojas-Williams said. "And it all happened at the same time without the artists knowing each other until later on."

Milly Wu marched through the J. Paul Getty Museum's galleries of 19th-century European paintings, stopping just long enough to frame Monets, Manets and, of course, Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises" with her smartphone camera.

With a series of clicks, masterpieces became souvenirs to share with her friends back home in Hangzhou, China.

"It's very beautiful," said her dad, Will Wu, an information technology professional who used to work for Hewlett-Packard and speaks some English. "Mr. Getty had a great eye for this type of item."

It involves sending staff members to at least three seminars sponsored by the LA tourism board. Once the coursework is done, cultural sites can win certification by launching an informational Web page in Mandarin, issuing Mandarin maps and guidebooks, and accepting China UnionPay, Chinese travelers' favored credit card. Having staffers who speak Chinese is recommended but not required. Providing museum audio tours in Chinese and adding Chinese dishes to menus at food concessions are also desirable but not mandated. At the Getty's cafeteria, visitors can get a menu in Chinese, and it usually will include a Chinese dish.

With their visual focus, art museums are natural places for the trend to flourish. Just ask Beyonce and Jay Z, who in October famously posted selfies with "The Mona Lisa" at the Louvre in Paris.

Everyone dislikes some kind of music, but are there people out there who don't respond to musical pathos?

Apparently, yes, and they weren't lying when they said so, according to a study published online Thursday in Current Biology.

A team of researchers from Spain and Canada was trying to develop an accurate questionnaire to gauge people's sense of reward from music when they found that roughly 5 percent of their study subjects reported getting no pleasure at all from music.

So they followed up by testing 30 subjects, grouped by their relative affinity for music. The bottom group, which expressed the least pleasure in music, also exhibited the least change in heart rate or skin conductivity (proxy measures of emotional response) when listening even to pieces they chose.

Subjects were asked to bring several chosen pieces, Marco said. The so-called hyper-hedonic, characterized by high music appreciation, brought in what could only be described as an eclectic mix (artists with multiple cuts included Carlos Santana, Paco de Lucia and Beethoven; Pink Floyd, Deep Purple and Genesis were wedged in among Beirut, Rihanna and movie score composer Clint Mansell, the former front man for Pop Will Eat Itself).

CHICAGO, Ill. — For New Trier High School sophomore Sophia Pellar, a pair of special earplugs recently donated by a North Shore audiologist has put an end to the pain she suffered when playing flute in the pep band.

"I wear earplugs during pep band season, because it can be crazy loud," said Sophia, 16. "But the thought of wearing them every day is a little embarrassing."

"I had never thought of it at all ... and she has been playing the flute since she was in fourth grade," said Pellar, a physician. "I also have concerns when I walk by my kids when they have their earbuds in and I can still hear their music. And the longer they listen, the louder it seems to get."

WASHINGTON — Piano virtuoso Jan Lisiecki is about to leave his teen years behind. And although the Polish-Canadian musician may not know what gifts he'll be getting for his 20th birthday on March 23, he can at least count on some balmy temperatures. When his milestone birthday arrives, Lisiecki will be on a plane winging to Abu Dhabi, where he's scheduled to perform for the first time.

"We're going to get some warm weather, which is always nice when you live in Canada," Lisiecki said recently by phone from the Calgary home he shares with his parents, who will be traveling with him to Abu Dhabi.

MINNEAPOLIS — Tremell Caldwell fidgeted like any 7-year-old kept indoors on one of the first gorgeous days of spring, tapping his feet impatiently on the floor, making funny faces and wiggling the cello between his knees. But when music teacher Patricia Morgan-Brist gave the command "Bows ready!" he laid his bow across the strings and got his left-hand fingers into note-playing position.

"I didn't start playing the trumpet till I was 12," he said. "It gave me a voice at a time when I really needed one and allowed me to feel like I was doing something substantial. When you're a kid you can get caught up in so many superficial or negative things. Music helps you stand out for all the right reasons."

Back in the school music room, Tremell Caldwell stood under a large poster of jazz great John Coltrane, asking, "Can I go outside now?"

Morgan-Brist said yes, but first asked him to read aloud from a handwritten note addressed to him by one of the program's supporters.

He broke into a broad grin, then bolted for the door.
Patrick Carney of the Black Keys has also ranted. "My whole thing about music is: If somebody's making money, then the artist should be getting a fair cut of it," he told the Seattle Times.

In her op-ed, Swift wrote: "Music is art, art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for." That's a noble idea that would be easier to live by if the Internet had never happened, and of course, if the Internet had never happened, the Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, native wouldn't have 46 million followers.

It will be to Beirut, Lebanon, for the viola and violin teacher, who's left Greenville, North Carolina, every summer for the last five years and gone to places "emerging from conflict" as part of a program for students in formerly war-torn areas. A kind of summer camp, it teaches students who already have some musical training, and they rehearse and form an orchestra for a concert at the end of the visit.

Every year, the State Department and nonprofit groups help send musical troupes, dance groups and teachers abroad to promote American culture and generate goodwill.

It's all part of cultural diplomacy, an idea that got its start with the "jazz ambassadors" at the height of the Cold War in the 1950s and 1960s. To buff its image, the U.S. sent jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Louis Armstrong and others overseas to showcase the unique American art form.

The programs and cultural exchanges have exploded since then, with the latest rage being hip-hop, an in-demand art form but one that has also drawn criticism of "hip-hop diplomacy."

He said, for example, that while the Prophet Muhammad was a ruler who used force to maintain public order, he never responded to personal insults with violence.

COROLLA, N.C. — Retired Washington, D.C., policeman E.T. Smith patrolled the beach in his four-wheel drive truck on a recent morning, keeping an eye out for wild mustangs and the drunks who like to harass them. The horses have survived on this narrow barrier island for some 500 years, thought to be descendants of colonial mounts that swam to shore when Spanish galleons ran aground on the shoals and sandbars of North Carolina's Outer Banks. They've withstood centuries of hurricanes and nor'easters on this isolated spit of sand, marsh and woods, and became a huge draw for visitors.

Pressure is growing for a solution, and the Southeast regional refuge manager for the Fish and Wildlife Service, David Viker, struck a conciliatory tone in a recent interview. Viker said the agency was going to work with equine geneticist Cothran on a new study to look at the potential for bringing fresh genes into the Corolla herd and how many horses the habitat could support.

One vessel that reached Indonesian waters early Monday was stopped by the navy and given food, water and directions to Malaysia. Navy spokesman First Adm. Manahan Simorangkir said the fishing vessel was in good condition and the people on board looked fine, but cramped.

Worried that boats will start washing ashore with dead bodies, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the United States and several other foreign governments and international organizations have held emergency meetings, but participants say there are no immediate plans to search for vessels in the busy Malacca Strait.

Attacks on members of the religious minority, which numbers around 1.3 million, have in the last three years left up to 280 people dead and forced 140,000 others from their homes. They now live under apartheid-like conditions in crowded camps just outside the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, where they have little access to school or adequate health care.

"When something like this happens that confounds us, we're offended by it, and we're scared by it," said Ric Gillespie, a former U.S. aviation accident investigator who wrote a book about Earhart's still-unsolved 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean. "We had the illusion of control and it's just been shown to us that oh, folks, you know what? A really big airliner can just vanish. And nobody wants to hear that."

This much is known for sure: An ambitious activist in a midsized city in a far-flung corner of the Lower 48 last Thursday unleashed a storm of anger and sympathy that spread coast to coast and shows no sign of abating. She was scheduled to speak publicly about the controversy Monday night, but canceled her appearance. Instead, she sent a letter of resignation to the NAACP's national headquarters and posted a lengthy explanation on the Spokane chapter's Facebook page.

Dolezal recently walked away from a TV reporter who confronted her about her race. The reporter from KXLY in Spokane showed Dolezal a photograph of an elderly black man whose picture was on the Spokane NAACP's Facebook page and asked whether it was her father. "Yes, that's my dad," she replied. Then, when asked whether she is African-American, Dolezal replied, "I don't understand the question," and walked away.

As the nation's 375,000 nail technicians buff, polish and file our fingers and toes, that workplace exposure to chemicals in the polish and glue can pose a real threat. But it's not just the amount of those substances that can turn them toxic, it is also the way they get into workers' bodies.

The risks are many: Dust shavings from filed nails can settle on the skin like pollen and cause irritation or can be inhaled (and those small particles could contain chemicals from the polishes or acrylics). Technicians could also inhale harmful vapors or mists from the chemicals in the shop. The compounds could also settle into workers' eyes. Moreover, these substances could be swallowed while eating, drinking or puffing on a cigarette during a break.

Ethyl methacrylate (EMA) is the main substance in artificial fingernails. The substance can be problematic for both nail technicians and customers, causing allergies, asthma and dermatitis. To get around that risk, artificial fingernails should be applied at a ventilated worktable, according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. NIOSH advises workers removing artificial nails to wear safety glasses to protect their eyes as well as long sleeves and gloves to protect their skin from acrylic dust.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140221_SILVER.jpg" />CHICAGO — Silver has long been known for its ability to kill some of the nasty microbes that can make people sick. In hospitals, it's used to help burn victims, to combat germs on catheters and even to wipe out dangerous "superbugs" that have grown resistant to traditional antibiotics.

Now, capitalizing on consumers' fear of germs, companies are adding tiny, powerful silver particles to cutting boards, underwear, yoga mats, running shirts, socks and an expanding array of other "antibacterial" goods.

Such products are made possible by recent advances in technology that allow manufacturers to create nano-sized silver and incorporate it into various materials. (A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter; a human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000 nanometers wide.)

NAPA, Calif. — City officials in Napa had long worried that the grand building on the corner of Second and Brown streets — with its brick walls and giant red-tiled cupolas — could be devastated by a major earthquake.

So city officials required brick structures such as the landmark Alexandria Square building to get seismic retrofitting — bolting brick walls to ceilings and floors to make them stronger. The work was completed years ago on the 104-year-old property.

"Long duration and exploration spaceflights (including extended stays on the ISS or exploration missions to an asteroid or Mars) will likely expose crews to levels of known risks beyond those allowed by current health standards," according to the report led by Jeffrey Kahn of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics, "as well as to a wide range of risks that are poorly characterized, uncertain and perhaps unforeseeable."

NASA's newest robotic explorer rocketed into space late Friday in an unprecedented moonshot from Virginia that dazzled sky watchers along the East Coast.

But the LADEE spacecraft quickly ran into equipment trouble, and while NASA assured everyone early Saturday that the lunar probe was safe and on a perfect track for the moon, officials acknowledged the problem needs to be resolved in the next two to three weeks.

LADEE's reaction wheels were turned on to orient and stabilize the spacecraft, which was spinning too fast after it separated from the final rocket stage, Worden said. But the computer automatically shut the wheels down, apparently because of excess current. He speculated the wheels may have been running a little fast.

LADEE, which is the size of a small car, is expected to reach the moon on Oct. 6.

The telescope on the Kepler mission finds new planets by watching thousands of stars simultaneously. The brightness of a star changes in intensity when an object, such as a planet, passes in front of it.

It was just another average Friday morning in Chelyabinsk, Russia, when suddenly a fireball brighter than the sun streaked across the sky. Residents were still confused by the giant firework they had just witnessed when minutes later there was a huge explosion in the air. The force of this sonic boom smashed windows and blew the doors off buildings.

The blinding light and deafening noise were caused by an asteroid moving at a rate of 40,000 miles per hour as it entered Earth's atmosphere. This 50-foot wide rock burned up in a flash before exploding 14 miles above Chelyabinsk in Russia's Ural Mountains. Small fragments from the asteroid have been found on the ground all around the region.

About 1,500 people were injured by the explosion above their heads. Most of the wounded were hurt by falling or broken glass, as about 7,200 buildings were damaged by the air blast.

## Russia's Undetected, Uninvited (And Noisy) Guest

## What To Do If A Huge Space Rock Is Coming Our Way

Last week, a U.S. House of Representatives Science Committee hearing was held in response to the Russian asteroid. But the news from the meeting was not very reassuring. Charles Bolden, the chief of NASA, said that our planet is defenseless against an undetected meteor.

NASA has discovered and is monitoring 95 percent of the biggest objects near Earth. Yet the biggest danger from space is the rocks that scientists do not yet know about. Asteroids that are a kilometer or larger in diameter are very closely tracked. It is vital that they are kept under careful watch because if an asteroid that size hits Earth, it could wipe out the human species.

## The End Of The World As We Know It

White House science adviser John Holdren explained: "An asteroid of that size, or bigger, could plausibly end civilization." Indeed, many scientists believe that a huge meteorite crashed into what is now known as Mexico 66 million years ago. This created a massive impact that changed Earth's climate so significantly that nearly all animal and plant life on the planet was obliterated. This triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs.

WASHINGTON — The world's most expensive science project — the $100 billion-plus International Space Station — is poised to get four more years in orbit.

According to documents obtained by the Orlando Sentinel, NASA plans to announce this week that it has White House approval to extend the station's operations by four years until 2024.

The decision follows years of pressure by top NASA officials, who consider the station a critical steppingstone to future exploration. But a four-year extension likely would cost NASA about $3 billion a year from 2021 to 2024. That's a major chunk of the agency's annual budget, which is now about $17 billion, and a longer mission could force NASA to make tough financial decisions in the future.

The administration's approval, however, doesn't guarantee that the station, which has been continuously occupied since 2000, will survive past its current end date of 2020. At some point, Congress must approve a NASA budget that includes an extension of the station's life. The plan also must get the support of whoever wins the White House in 2016 — though the backing of President Barack Obama now might make it harder for the next administration to renege.

WASHINGTON — It takes a lot of geometry and physics to get a race car to go 200 laps at speeds that can top 200 miles per hour.

In a nod to the often overlooked science behind races like Sunday's Daytona 500, NASCAR announced Friday a commitment to promote "STEM" — the buzzword for science, technology, engineering and math — inside classrooms and out.

What's needed is not glamorous, and not unique to one park. The deferred maintenance backlog at all national parks is now pegged at $11.5 billion, a burden looming even as the National Park Service solicits corporate and congressional support for its 2016 centennial celebration.

The free Nikes are a good example of how the clinic has adapted its practice of medicine to suit its clientele.

The patch of corn near the driveway is a special white heirloom corn handed down by generations of Oneida Indians. The black beans sprouting on nearby vines were grown for centuries by Hopi Indians. There's squash from the Lakota tribe, corn from the Dakotas, and a team of urban teenagers who are learning to harvest, cook and market the plants that fed their ancestors.

"There is history in those plants, and (the youth) are carrying it genetically forward," said Diane Wilson, executive director of the nonprofit, as she watched the teens pulling up vegetables. Restoring health is the goal of the agency, which receives funding from the Minnesota Department of Health along with various state foundations.

The groups have a big task before them. While it's well-known that Indians were the first to cultivate pumpkins, beans, corn and squash, they actually used about 1,900 types of plants for foods and 2,900 for medicines, said Craig Hassel, an associate professor in the University of Minnesota's Department of Food Science and Nutrition, who has worked with Dream of Wild Health since its founding.

The farm also grows organic vegetables, which its teenage "Garden Warriors" were harvesting last week.

So, too, is a movement among Native Americans across the nation to improve their health by rediscovering ancestral foods and connections to lands once lost.

Far from access to natural maple syrup, wild rice and game, the residents at Little Earth of United Tribes — a south Minneapolis low-income housing complex — are finding new old ways to grow crops that existed long before European settlers arrived.

WASHINGTON — Official Washington has rarely paid much attention to the Bureau of Indian Education, a long-dysfunctional corner of the federal bureaucracy that is responsible for overseeing nearly 200 schools serving approximately 50,000 Native American children in 23 states.

President Barack Obama is seeking to boost funding for Indian education by $150 million, including nearly $60 million to begin fixing dozens of tribal school facilities that have languished in disrepair for decades. The funding request is part of a broader administration effort to improve lives for Native American youth.

The federal government guaranteed that it would ensure that Native American children had access to education in many of the treaties it signed with tribes during the 19th century, as settlers pushed west across the country.

Many days, she finds a layer of black dust coating the inside of her trailer home. Farmers who have worked the land for decades say fouled air from the mine and nearby Four Corners coal-fired power plant has shriveled fruits and vegetables in the field. And there are fewer eagles and jack rabbits, which once thrived on the Navajo Reservation, they add.

In the last two years, the air, Dixon suspects, has killed 38 of her 56 sheep. She found the last two — a lamb and a ewe — a few months ago. But it's not just her animals who are suffering: The Navajo elder often gasps for breath from the soot, she says.

This year, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Office of Surface Mining released a draft environmental impact report saying improvements were being made at Four Corners, and estimating the chance of getting cancer near the plant as one in a million.

FARMINGTON, N.M. — In World War II he served as a [Navajo code talker](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american), one of the Marines who became legendary by using their native tongue to transmit messages the enemy could not decipher. Years later, to express its appreciation, the Navajo Nation built Tom Jones Jr. a house.

These days the 89-year-old Jones struggles to keep warm during winter because the only heat inside his house emanates from an antique wood stove in the living room. The electricity doesn't work in his bathroom and the floor has worn away, exposing plywood beneath his feet.

"My desire is a house where I can be able to get around, to have a heating system so I can sleep well and enjoy life," Jones said in the Native language of Dine, with which he spoke for the Allies through the war. "This is how I would want it."

"There is a huge crisis taking place in our nation at the present time," said Rick Abasta, spokesman for Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly. "If you travel through the reservation, you'll even see some families living in storage sheds due to the housing situation."

The tribe began constructing homes for veterans in the 1980s, and a $6-million trust fund for Navajo veterans created by the tribe allowed the launch of a home-building program in 1998.

The aim was to provide houses — free of charge — to veterans in need or help them pay for home repairs. Outside the Navajo Nation, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provides myriad services for veterans, but a free house is unheard of.

There is only so much the tribe can do, Abasta said, because of limited funding. "We meet with congressmen about these issues, but most often it falls on deaf ears," he said.

"Now you can see how our Navajo code talkers are treated," Arviso said. At Jones' house she has erected a sign out front: "Navajo Code Talker Needs a New Home."

When he was recruited into the military 73 years ago, Jones said, he was told that he would have whatever he needed after the war. He served as a corporal in the 3rd Marine division from 1943 to 1945 — a good portion of the time on the front lines, including at Iwo Jima.

When he returned home, he said, he was able to provide for himself, at one point working in the uranium mines. When he was younger he never asked for handouts, he said proudly.

He laments his situation now. When his health took a downturn in 2007, he could no longer provide for himself. Jones has end-stage renal disease and undergoes dialysis twice a week. He has a hard time hearing and can barely talk. His U.S. Marines cap emblazoned with the Stars and Stripes seems to overwhelm his small frame.

Jarvis Jones, 37, who followed his grandfather into the Marines, said he was disappointed and disgusted with how his grandfather and other code talkers live.

"It's a lot of runaround," the younger Jones said. "The story on the reservation is 'We have no funds.'"

Last week, the tribe's high court struck candidate Christopher Deschene from the ballot because other contenders disputed that he was fluent in Navajo, a requirement for the office under tribal law. Deschene also refused to take a language competency test.

The subject may be politics, but the underlying issue is identity. "Our sacred language defines us as individuals and as a Nation," the justices wrote in their decision.

The U.S. Navy conducted a historic flight test Wednesday off the coast of Virginia when an experimental bat-winged drone made an arrested landing aboard an aircraft carrier for the first time.

The flight of the [drone](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone), dubbed X-47B "Salty Dog 502," could redefine naval aviation. Landing on an aircraft carrier as it plies the ocean and pitches with the waves is considered an extremely difficult feat for even the most seasoned pilot. The X-47B was controlled almost entirely by computer.

WASHINGTON — A decade of counterinsurgency and counterterror operations has created doubts about the utility of the aircraft carrier. Today's budget cuts threaten to shrink the Navy's carrier force — already reduced from 11 to 10 — to as few as eight or nine.

WASHINGTON — A former Navy man launched an attack Monday morning inside a building at the Washington Navy Yard, spraying gunfire on office workers in the cafeteria and in the hallway at the heavily secured installation, authorities said. Thirteen people were killed, including the gunman.

As for whether it may have been a terrorist attack, Mayor Vincent Gray said: "We don't have any reason to think that at this stage." But he said the possibility had not been ruled out.

Everybody in the first room is barred from leaving it until the TV broadcast is complete. Cellphones, computers and other devices are temporarily confiscated from witnesses of the drawing to ensure results are not leaked before the TV broadcast.

To see the future of the NBA, they only have to swivel their heads. Whiteboards inside their office are filled with algorithms in shades of red, blue and green. Programmers sit clustered around computers inputting lines of complex code.

What resembles gibberish to anyone without a degree in computer science could help NBA teams find optimal ways to grab rebounds and defend pick and rolls through a proprietary software system developed by Maheswaran and Chang. The researchers from USC's Viterbi School of Engineering are the NBA's newest go-to guys, distilling the oceans of analytical data that will be available league-wide for the first time this season through motion-tracking cameras placed in every arena.

It all starts with six tiny computer-vision cameras strategically placed in the rafters of each NBA arena that record the movement of every player, referee and the ball 25 times a second. The data is electronically transmitted to STATS to be categorized into passes, dribbles, shots and rebounds, among other groups. "It has potential to unlock a lot of the secrets of our game," said Steve Hellmuth, NBA executive vice president of operations and technology.

Teams can access relatively simple information such as the number of passes into the post in 60 to 90 seconds while games are in progress. More complicated statistics are available postgame after the data is processed through sophisticated algorithms. Although many of the numbers will be available to all 30 teams, customized reports generated by specialized providers such as STATS and Second Spectrum can be viewed only by the teams requesting them.

Several teams, including the Los Angeles Clippers, have also hired employees to help sift through the information. "Every team is going to have their own formula that they will create that works for their team in scouting and everything," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said.

Los Angeles Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis, who will be largely responsible for the team's defense, said a thick packet of data may yield only a handful of numbers coaches pass on to players.

Players are conflicted about the value of data — like, which players prefer to shoot after just two dribbles.

Said Clippers point guard Chris Paul: "If I just guard him and after two dribbles I stop and he takes a third and I say, 'Hey, man, you're only supposed to take two dribbles,' then what? It's cool, but you have to play."

CHICAGO — Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter testified Tuesday that he was essentially paid to play via his scholarship as the National Labor Relations Board opened a closely watched hearing on a bid to form what would be the first union for college athletes in U.S. history.

Colter said most of the team's 85 scholarship players support forming a union, though he has been the only one to step forward publicly with the support of the United Steelworkers, the players association and its leader, former UCLA linebacker Ramogi Huma. Huma was also expected to testify, possibly on Wednesday.

Supporters say a union would provide athletes a vehicle to lobby for financial security and improved safety, noting that players are left out of the billions generated through college athletics. They contend scholarships sometimes don't even cover livings expenses for a full year.

A decision by the NLRB could come soon after the testimony concludes.

For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, like Northwestern. Public universities, which are subject to different regulations, could follow later.
NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — The mayor of the South Carolina town where a white officer was filmed fatally shooting an unarmed black man called the incident a "horrible tragedy" as he announced that all patrol officers would be outfitted with body cameras.

"As the mayor said, right is right and wrong is wrong," Sanford said. "We all live with the decisions that we make. And so will this officer."
Fossil remains of European Neanderthals have allowed scientists to describe their appearance in detail. This is not the case with Denisovans, however — evidence of their existence is based only on a fragment of bone from a child's finger and two teeth that were discovered in 2010 in the Altai Mountains of Siberia.

LOS ANGELES — Adding to the accumulating evidence that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than previously thought, scientists in Europe said that they had unearthed strong evidence that the early hominins — often typecast as brutish, club-lugging ape-men — fashioned their own specialized bone tools.

But the recently unearthed lissoirs, about 41,000 to 51,000 years old, could predate the arrival of modern humans in Europe and suggest that Neanderthals might have figured out how to make the tools independently, Soressi and her team wrote.

"I don't think that the image of the brutish or stupid Neanderthal is true anymore," said Paola Villa, a curator at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History who wasn't part of the study.

Ancient lissoirs were made from animal ribs. Leather workers probably scraped the tools against hides to create more lustrous, waterproof leather. Craftspeople still use lissoirs today.

Soressi's group unearthed the first lissoir fragment from the Pech-de-l'Aze I excavation site in southwestern France in 2005. Team member and archaeologist William Rendu of the French National Center for Scientific Research noticed the unusual looking fragment of deer rib and "immediately saw" that its shape and markings weren't anatomical or due to sediment wearing away at the bone, he said.

Further examination under a microscope revealed that the artifact, less than a centimeter long, had a worn edge and a polished surface, suggesting that it had come from a tool.

"It was obvious it was a lissoir," Soressi said, adding that lissoirs in use today share a similar design. The ancient fragment was probably a tip that had broken off, she said.

"It's a hard call," said Donald Henry, an archaeologist from the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma who was not involved in the study. Henry said the preponderance of the evidence suggested that Neanderthals adopted the technology from modern humans.

But even if Neanderthals did adopt elements of modern human culture, "that doesn't mean they're inferior," Henry said. "There are many examples of human societies adopting technologies from other societies, and it doesn't imply that the ones who adopted it were stupid."

The findings add to earlier evidence of complex behavior in Neanderthals, such as using tree resin as glue and making pitch to waterproof their boats, said Villa of the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History.

"Maybe they didn't have opera, but they weren't dumb," Henry added. "They survived hundreds of thousands of years. We haven't done that yet."
For decades, archaeologists have speculated on the location of the queen's remains, the last royal mummy missing from the dynasty of the famous King Tutankhamun, better known as King Tut. But now, an archaeologist claims that he has found her secret tomb in the Valley of the Kings, hidden just beyond a wall near the resting place of the boy-pharaoh.

One of these doors would possibly lead to a storeroom, Reeves said. But the larger door on the north side of the burial chamber, he suggests, could lead to another room holding the remains of Nefertiti, believed by some to be the mother of Tutankhamun.

Officials said the quake occurred at a depth of only 7 miles, which is considered shallow in geological terms. The shallower the quake, the more destructive power it carries. Witnesses said the trembling and swaying of the earth went on for several minutes.

"This quake was so big, "said Prajana W. Pradham, who is helping coordinate the CARE relief agency's emergency response. "We've been feeling tremors for four hours. I just felt another big jolt."

Kathmandu's airport was closed, television and Internet services were disrupted, and phone and electricity lines were down.

The problem with that scenario, the authors realized, was that the Kuiper Belt lacks the mass to make it happen. When the scientists turned to the "crazy" notion of a planet, however, their simulations generated just the right kind of aligned orbits. They also revealed something else: The gravity of a giant planet should lead to an entirely independent set of objects whose orbits are not aligned with one another but are sharply tilted compared with the orbits of the planets—up to 90 degrees away from the plane of the solar system or even more. "That seemed really puzzling," Batygin says. "But then Mike said, 'I think I've seen something like these in the data.'" Sure enough, observers have spotted a half dozen or so objects just like this and nobody had come up with a good explanation of how they might have gotten there. Now Batygin and Brown's simulation was providing one. "The fact that they're now marshaling two new, independent lines of evidence for a hypothetical planet," Laughlin says, "makes their case even stronger."

"The first time with marijuana is different from the first time you are knocking your wife unconscious," said Judy Harris Kluger, executive director of Sanctuary for Families and a former judge in New York City. "It's not what they did was such a small sort of slap on the wrist. Punishment to me, they should have suspended for a season at least and let him appeal. At least you send a message that this is not tolerated, that this matters."

It's only a six-week internship coaching inside linebackers for the Cardinals, through training camp and the four preseason games. Nonetheless, it marks another barrier broken for women in sports.

Welter said she never dared entertain the thought of coaching in the NFL.

Arians called Welter and offered her one of the team's six internships, then he got the backing of General Manager Steve Keim and Bidwill.

Hartline has even passed on budgeting tips to Dolphins rookies during their mandatory money management classes.

Three years later, in 2005, the Colts broke ground on the $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium in downtown Indianapolis, with the team paying $100 million and the city and state kicking in the rest.

Los Angeles had again been jilted by another in a long line of would-be suitors. Los Angeles has been more valuable to the NFL without a team than with one, and owners have used the threat of moving here to improve aging stadiums and bolster bottom lines.

BALTIMORE — Just in time for this fall's congressional elections, a jeering section of media pundits and politicians have taken to the airwaves denouncing the National Football League for not properly policing the private lives of two of its most visible employees.

No one is excusing the unconscionable behavior of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson or a handful of other NFL stars, mind you.

Domestic violence and child abuse are serious violations of our criminal and moral codes, and their perpetrators ought to receive stiff punishment. But this is America. They deserve a fair trial and — in the likely event they are found guilty — appropriate punishments that fit their particular crimes.

In the meantime, let's get real. The NFL can urge its several thousand roster and taxi squad players to behave in a morally upright manner, but it cannot do 24-hour surveillance on them without seriously violating their civil liberties anymore than NBC News, IBM, GM or Exxon Mobil can ride herd on their workers' private lives.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama said Tuesday that the U.S. will do everything it can to help Nigeria find nearly [300 teenage girls](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Nigerian+schoolgirls) missing since they were kidnapped from school three weeks ago by an Islamist extremist group that has threatened to sell them.

U.S. armed forces were not being sent, Carney noted.

The yearlong 4,250 mile journey along the world's longest river will see the former British army captain pass through six countries.

Though he faces many dangers on the walk from both man and beast, Wood noted that past explorers didn't have the luxury of a satellite phone or Google maps.

The test was met with a burst of jubilation and pride in Pyongyang. A North Korean television anchor, reading a typically propaganda-heavy statement, said a test of a "miniaturized" hydrogen bomb had been a "perfect success" that elevated the country's "nuclear might to the next level."

Washington and nuclear experts have been skeptical about past North Korean claims about H-bombs, which are much more powerful and much more difficult to make than atomic bombs. A confirmed test would further worsen already abysmal relations between Pyongyang and its neighbors and lead to a strong push for tougher sanctions on North Korea at the United Nations. The Security Council was holding an emergency meeting.

Her request, which the teacher approved, represented one small step for a movement slowly gaining momentum in schools around the country: questioning, scaling back or, in a handful of schools, even eliminating the nightly homework ritual once thought as all-American as junior proms and cafeteria food fights.

For decades, homework's value has been hotly debated.

But now a growing legion of critics say the notion that America can close the learning gap with China or India by stuffing kids' backpacks with math worksheets as early as kindergarten is backfiring — creating a nation of stressed-out, sleep-deprived children, despite scant scientific evidence they are actually learning more from the reams of homework.

Some school administrators are starting to listen. Radnor School District has unveiled a policy stating that homework shouldn't "interfere with the student's health and well-being."

Several New Jersey districts, including Princeton Public Schools and the West Windsor-Plainsboro School District, are experimenting with banning take-home assignments on designated nights or weekends and school vacations.

STOCKHOLM — Short story master Alice Munro, who captures the everyday lives and epiphanies of men and women in rural Canada with elegant and precise prose, won the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday.

Seen as a contemporary Chekhov for her warmth, insight and compassion, she has captured a wide range of lives and personalities without passing judgment on her characters. Unusually for Nobel winners, Munro's work consists almost entirely of short stories. "Lives of Girls and Women" is her only novel, and even that is often described as a collection of linked stories.

"I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," the 82-year-old said by telephone when contacted by The Canadian Press in Victoria, British Columbia.

Munro told Canadian broadcaster CBC she was "surprised and delighted" at the news, which she heard in a pre-dawn phone call from her daughter.

She received a scholarship to study at the University of Western Ontario, majoring in journalism, and was still an undergraduate when she sold a story to CBC radio in Canada. She dropped out of college to marry a fellow student, James Munro, had three children and became a full-time housewife. By her early 30s, she had become depressed and said she could barely write a full sentence.

James Rothman, 62, of Yale University, Randy Schekman, 64, of the University of California, Berkeley, and Dr. Thomas Sudhof, 57, of Stanford University shared the $1.2 million prize for their research on how tiny bubbles called vesicles act as cargo carriers inside cells.

Japanese People Who Conserve Article 9 is a civic organization committed to preserving the pacifism enshrined in Article 9 of Japan's postwar constitution, in which the country pledges to abstain from "the right of belligerency" or use of force to settle international disputes. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been leading a push for revising the constitution to permit a more concerted defense posture since he took office nearly two years ago.

Novaya Gazeta appears on several organizations' list of peace prize contenders. The newspaper remains independent and highly critical of Putin and has paid the price with at least six of its journalists slain since its 1993 founding.

The Higgs particle solved a problem that physicists had puzzled over for some time: how did matter form shortly after the Big Bang, eventually leading to the universe as we know it today? The explanation scientists came up with centers on the idea of an invisible field that pervades the universe. As particles travel through the field, they are slowed down like a ball rolling through molasses. If this is the case then it should be possible to detect a type of particle, dubbed the Higgs boson, where the fields clump together.

OSLO, Norway — A coalition of Tunisian workers, business owners, rights activists and lawyers won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for intervening at a crucial time to push the North African country that sparked the Arab Spring revolutions toward democracy and away from civil war.

Mohammed Fadhel Mafoudh, head of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers, called the Nobel Peace Prize a message to all parties embroiled in political conflicts.

It was formed after the July 2013 assassination of left-wing politician Mohammed Brahmi plunged Tunisia into crisis, with opposition parties boycotting the Parliament. A national dialogue led by the quartet helped negotiate a transition from the elected Islamist-led government to an interim government of technocrats tasked with organizing new elections for a permanent government.

A giant tsunami created by the quake would wash away coastal towns, destroy U.S. 101 and cause $70 billion in damage over a large swath of the Pacific coast. More than 100 bridges would be lost, power lines toppled and coastal towns isolated. Residents would have as few as 15 minutes' notice to flee to higher ground, and as many as 10,000 would perish.

In Grays Harbor County in Washington state, crews will begin building an elementary school gym this summer to double as a "vertical evacuation center" — built so that 1,000 people can flee to the roof during a tsunami, protected by a high wall.

The Cascadia fault is powerful for two reasons: It is both extremely long and it is a "megathrust" fault, in which two tectonic plates — slabs of rock roughly the size of New Mexico floating atop the Earth's molten core — are being forced underneath the gigantic North American plate.

But the North American plate is old and strong, and won't be pulled down forever.

LOS ANGELES — Four California high schools will be forced to change mascots after Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation making the state the first to bar public schools from using the Redskins name for sports teams.

It was one of three sports-related bills approved by Brown in the last week. He also signed a measure that bans players and coaches from using smokeless tobacco at professional baseball parks and another that recognizes competitive cheerleading as a high school sport.

Four massive drilling rigs, idled on the windswept prairie near the North Dakota-Montana line here, wait for oil prices to rise again. Last year, when oil was selling for $100 a barrel, each rig employed almost 200 people, directly or indirectly. Now, with oil prices cut in half, they employ Shay Hunt, the night watchman.

"Over there, that was my rig," said Hunt, a 35-year-old father of three from Williston, who has worked the oil fields for more than 13 years.

"Rain comes, 40-below comes, lightning and tornadoes come, we keep working," he said, facing away from the downed rigs and into the biting wind blowing in from the west. "One time a (grass) fire a came up around the rig. We kept on working."

NEW YORK — Residents in the nation's Northeast flocked to hardware and grocery stores to pick up emergency supplies Sunday as forecasters warned that a "crippling and potentially historic blizzard" could dump as much as 3 feet of snow from Philadelphia to Boston starting Monday.

Tens of millions of Americans live in the path of Winter Storm Juno churning along the Atlantic Coast, which is expected to hit New Jersey, New York City, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts especially hard. The result — a classic "northeaster" storm — could shut down the nation's most densely populated region for days, closing schools and businesses from Monday afternoon through the week, officials warned.

"Eternal President" Kim Il Sung continues to reign — according to North Korean lore — 21 years after his death. His son, "Dear Leader" Kim Jong Il, died in 2011 but lies in state with his father in a huge mausoleum the size of Buckingham Palace on the outskirts of Pyongyang. And the grandson, "Great Successor" Kim Jong Un, is making sure none of his subjects forget about the family line — by strengthening the bizarre personality cult that the family has perpetuated during the past 60 years.

Then you could begin to understand the collective anguish of the Norwegian populace after last weekend's cross-country skiing results at the Olympics.

In both the men's and women's relay events, Norway failed to win a medal — a national calamity for the country where residents are said to be born with Nordic skis on their feet. It was only the second time Norway has been shut out of the relay medals since 1964.

Making matters worse, arch-rival Sweden won both races, racking up such a big lead in Sunday's men's competition that Marcus Hellner, the Swedish anchor, had time to ease up and carry a flag down the homestretch.

At the Olympics, Norwegian fans relish the individual medals delivered by stars like Northug and Marit Bjorgen. But a strong showing in the four-leg team events affirms Norway's status as a cross-country power.

But there are also questions about the Norwegians' fitness, with speculation from other countries' coaches, athletes, and fans that Norway's skiers are simply failing to perform.

STAVANGER, Norway — Residents of the small Norwegian town of Rjukan have finally seen the light.

Tucked in between steep mountains, the town is normally shrouded in shadow for almost six months a year, with residents having to catch a cable car to the top of a nearby precipice to get a fix of midday vitamin D.

But on Wednesday faint rays from the winter sun for the first time reached the town's market square, thanks to three 183-square-foot (17-square-meter) mirrors placed on a mountain.

LONDON — American and British intelligence operations have been spying on gamers across the world, media outlets reported, saying that the world's most powerful espionage agencies sent undercover agents into virtual universes to monitor activity in online fantasy games such as "World of Warcraft."

On Monday, hours after he admitted disclosing a trove of intelligence secrets to the media, Snowden checked out of the glitzy Mira Hotel in Hong Kong, where he had holed up for weeks, and dropped out of sight.

WICOMICO RIVER, Md. — On the wall of the nutria eradication team's drab office at the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, there's a large whiteboard with names and numbers on it. They're bets for a long-running pool: How many nutria will the team find in the marshes of the Wicomico River?

It's an overcast April afternoon with a long-awaited bit of warmth in the air. The nutria project leader is coming back from a site in Quantico, Md.,where four of his trappers are roaming the Wicomico River in jon boats. They've killed about 120 nutria there so far and found a few more this particular morning.

The river is the site of the final battle in the long-running quest to eradicate the beaver-like rodents ("nutria" means "otter" in Spanish) that have destroyed thousands of acres of the state's wetlands over the past 40 years. It has taken longer than expected — news articles profiled the waning fight in 2011 — but finally, the state is almost free of the invasive rodents.

The wetlands in the Chesapeake region have experienced more marsh loss than most other wetlands around the world, Kendrot said, and a study in the 1990s proved that, even with other contributing factors, nutria were largely responsible.

The semi-aquatic critters, Kendrot describes them as "a 20-pound rat with a scaly tail and buck teeth," were brought to the United States from South America in the 1940s for the fur trade. They have established colonies in states throughout the Southeast and Pacific Northwest. In Louisiana, the nutria population reached 20 million in 20 years, creating a problem that is now too large for eradication.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140227_FOODLABELS.jpg" />WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Thursday will propose the first major revamp of nutrition labels in more than two decades, an update that would emphasize calorie information, include the amount of added sugars and revise serving sizes to reflect how people really consume food.

In a unanimous ruling Friday, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit largely agreed with her. The panel said the words "Tomorrow's Leaders" potentially violated students' right to free speech and the uniform policy must go unless the school district can justify it under a legal standard that is difficult to meet.

Though polling shows New Yorkers largely approve of Bloomberg's policies, those same surveys revealed the city was hungry for a change.

The oarfish, deep-sea dwellers that remain largely mysterious to researchers, have only been seen underwater a handful of times. What is known comes from the few carcasses that have washed ashore.

"If all you knew about deer was road kill ... how much would you actually know about deer?" said Milton Love, a research biologist at the Marine Science Institute at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "That's kind of where we are with oarfish."

The 18-foot giant found off Santa Catalina Island on Oct. 13 was among the largest oarfish reported in nearly 20 years. A 14-foot fish beached in Oceanside on Friday was dissected and examined by scientists Monday.

Results from the research could take years to complete, scientists said.

"Everyone has a cellphone with a camera on it," Hastings said. "Social media allows us to distribute those, and get information back to scientists."

As photos of the huge fish have made there way across the Internet, many theories have been offered as to why they died. One claim working its way around websites and blogs is that oarfish dying is a sign of an upcoming earthquake.

Experts, however, stressed that they have not pinpointed a cause of death.

The itinerary, like much of Obama's European trip this week, is expected to be dominated by talk of a new threat on Europe's doorstep. Obama and European leaders are to discuss Russia's armed seizure of the Crimean peninsula and how the West can prevent Moscow from moving farther into Ukraine.

On Tuesday, Obama repeated threats of more painful economic sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin sends troops into other regions of the former Soviet state. But the president also acknowledged that, for now, Crimea is likely to remain in Russian control. "There's no expectation that they will be dislodged by force," he said in a news conference in The Hague.

WASHINGTON — Seeking to energize his sluggish second term, President Barack Obama vowed Tuesday night in his State of the Union address to sidestep Congress "whenever and wherever" necessary to narrow economic disparities between rich and poor. He unveiled an array of modest executive actions to increase the minimum wage for federal contract workers and make it easier for millions of low-income Americans to save for retirement.

Draped in presidential grandeur, Obama's hour-long address served as the opening salvo in a midterm election fight for control of Congress that will quickly consume Washington's attention. Democrats, seeking to cast Republicans as uncaring about the middle class, have urged Obama to focus on economic mobility and the gap between the wealthy and poor. His emphasis on executive actions was greeted with shouts of "Do it!" from many members of his party.

Republicans, who saw their own approval ratings fall further in 2013, have also picked up the refrain of income inequality in recent months, though they have cast the widening gap between rich and poor as a symptom of Obama's economic policies.

"Give America a raise," Obama declared.

WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama rolled out a new plan Thursday to make two years of community college free, or nearly so, for millions of students across the country, a major investment that the White House cast as changing the face of higher education.

"What I'd like to do is to see the first two years of community college free for everybody who is willing to work for it," Obama said in a video shot on Air Force One and posted Thursday on Facebook, ahead of his planned visit Friday to a community college and technical center in Knoxville, Tennessee, as part of a trip designed to preview his policy plans for 2015.

For those who want to attend a two-year college, the costs are not nearly as daunting as a four-year university.

Now, the biting criticism of Sasha and Malia Obama by a Republican congressional aide has struck a new chord, particularly among African-Americans who hold up the first family as an icon of black family success.

Lauten apologized Friday on Facebook. "I reacted to an article and quickly judged the two young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged as a teenager," Lauten wrote.

"Black folks might not be gung-ho for Team Obama these days, but the Obama girls are untouchable," said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of African and African-American studies at Duke University. "When she (Lauten) discussed them lacking class, that not only struck a chord with blacks but with non-blacks, because the Obamas are viewed as role models for families."

Historian Doug Wead, a staffer in the George H.W. Bush White House who wrote about what he called the "triumph and tragedy" of first families in the book "All the Presidents' Children," says the critiques of first families stretch back into earlier eras.

MIAMI, Fla. — President Barack Obama on Wednesday paid his first visit to the Everglades, delivering an Earth Day speech that tied the threat rising seas pose for the imperiled River of Grass to wider climate change risks across the nation.

In addition to making an economic, public health and national security case for confronting the risks of climate change and rising seas, the president was in South Florida to tout his administration's record on tackling environmental problems, including imposing a historic cap on carbon pollution and spending $2.2 billion on Everglades restoration projects, the administration said.

Obama was expected to reveal new conservation efforts in four areas of the country, including Southwest Florida. And in a move some say is long overdue, the National Park Service will designate as a national historic landmark Marjory Stoneman Douglas' cottage in Coconut Grove, which several years ago sparked a contentious fight between preservationists and neighbors. The pioneering preservationist is largely credited with sparking Everglades restoration.

The Let Girls Learn initiative will build on a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) campaign launched last year to provide an education to the more than 60 million girls not in school. Existing government programs address topics such as education, leadership, nutrition and protection against gender-based violence and forced marriages.

"Peace Corps volunteers are in a unique position to break down barriers to girls education at the community level," Hessler-Radelet said. "They speak the local language, they understand the local culture."

"Every time I think about those kids, it gets me mad," Obama said.

WASHINGTON — Spurning furious Republicans, President Barack Obama unveiled expansive executive actions on immigration Thursday night to spare nearly 5 million people in the U.S. illegally from deportation and refocus enforcement efforts on "felons, not families."

The moves, affecting mostly parents and young people, marked the most sweeping changes to the nation's fractured immigration laws in nearly three decades and set off a fierce fight with Republicans over the limits of presidential powers.

The main beneficiaries of the president's actions are immigrants who have been in the U.S. illegally for more than five years but whose children are citizens or lawful permanent residents. After passing background checks and paying fees, those individuals will soon be able to seek relief from deportation and get work permits. The administration expects about 4.1 million people to qualify.

Obama is also broadening his 2012 directive that deferred deportation for some young immigrants who entered the country illegally. Obama will expand eligibility to people who arrived in the U.S. as minors before 2010, instead of the current cutoff of 2007, and will lift the requirement that applicants be under 31. The expansion is expected to affect about 300,000 people.

Applications for the new deportation deferrals will begin in the spring. Those who qualify would be granted deferrals for three years at a time.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/US_NEWS_JFK50YEARS_5_MCT.jpg" />WASHINGTON — Honoring the legacy of John F. Kennedy, President Barack Obama laid a wreath at the assassinated president's gravesite as a nation remembers that terrible day in Dallas a half-century ago Friday. Obama also recognized a group of distinguished Americans — including Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey — with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, an award created by Kennedy.

Both couples placed their hands over their hearts as taps sounded near a U.S. flag at half-staff before greeting Kennedy relatives, including some who arrived in Obama's motorcade, before Friday's 50th anniversary of the assassination.

The president spoke at a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the 1963 protest that became the most iconic moment of the civil rights movement. Obama, the first African-American president, spoke from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where King described his dream of racial equality as many black Americans still struggled to vote.

WASHINGTON — Now, President Barack Obama limps into his final two years in office.

All this while much of Washington and the political world tunes out Obama and starts looking in earnest for his successor. The political calendar renders the departing president "yesterday's news" as soon as the midterm elections are over and the 2016 presidential race begins, said Lou D'Allesandro, a veteran New Hampshire state senator and Democratic operative.

Obama enters these final months already hampered by low approval ratings that made him radioactive to most Democrats running in close elections this year. He spent the last two days leading up to Election Day in meetings at the White House.

WASHINGTON — Eyeing the end of his presidency, Barack Obama urged Americans Tuesday night to rekindle their belief in the promise of change that first carried him to the White House, declaring that the country must not allow election-year fear and division to put economic and security progress at risk.

CHICAGO — For people who don't live in the South Side neighborhood of Washington Park, there is hardly a reason to take the CTA's Green Line to the Garfield station.

Though barely a mile from the stately University of Chicago campus, the desolate block of East Garfield Boulevard between Martin Luther King Drive and Prairie Avenue has little to offer, mostly one shuttered storefront after another and remnants of broken signage from businesses that once beckoned customers.

But it's possible that the landscape could change. Washington Park residents are pinning their hopes on President Barack Obama — that he will select the U. of C. to host his presidential library and that the university will build it on the swath of vacant, city-owned land adjacent to the "L."

WASHINGTON — After steering clear of most messy legislative battles, first lady Michelle Obama on Tuesday publicly took on lawmakers, food companies and lunch ladies who say the school lunch law she championed nearly four years ago is leading kids to brown bag it.

Yet the primary focus of the trip is global warming.

Obama and Kerry are seeking a global climate treaty this December, to bolster the president's environmental legacy before leaving office. Obama has pledged a U.S. cut in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 28 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels, and planned to use the Alaska visit to press other nations to commit to similarly ambitious measures.

WASHINGTON — Whether belting out lyrics to Al Green's "Let's Stay Together," leading a mournful congregation through "Amazing Grace," or tweeting his Spotify music playlist that includes Stevie Wonder and Nina Simone, President Barack Obama has shown that he's a pretty soulful guy.

The president and his wife, Michelle, also have prominently showcased such R&amp;B and soul talent as Patti LaBelle and B.B. King during state dinners, music history events and the annual Easter Egg Roll.

Spalding landed on the first lady's Spotify music playlist. The Grammy Award-winning jazz singer and bassist said the variety of musicians who have performed at the White House conveys a message of inclusion at what the Obamas have long touted as the "People's House."

Pop superstar Beyonce, a favorite of both the president and first lady, is a mainstay at presidential events. She sang at an inaugural ball in 2009 and a state dinner for the Mexican president in 2010, and performed a highly scrutinized rendition of the national anthem at Obama's second inauguration ceremony in 2013.

"Sometimes the Bushes would have suggestions of people they wanted to invite to perform, and sometimes I would come up with a few names for Mrs. Bush to consider for an event and she would choose one," Berman said.

WASHINGTON — In a rare Oval Office address, President Barack Obama vowed Sunday night the United States will overcome a new phase of the terror threat that seeks to "poison the minds" of people here and around the world, as he sought to reassure Americans shaken by recent attacks in Paris and California.

WASHINGTON — The American public is unusually pessimistic about the direction of the country and increasingly fed up with Washington gridlock, a sour mood reflected in the worst disapproval ratings for President Barack Obama since he took office nearly five years ago.

People give elected officials unusually low grades — 31 percent rated them "D" and 38 percent gave them an "F," according to a new McClatchy-Marist poll.

Obama's disapproval rating climbed to 53 percent – the worst in 29 polls since he took office in January 2009 — while 43 percent approved of his job performance. The disapproval number was up sharply from the 47 percent reading in September and tops the previous high of 52 percent in September 2011.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama prodded Congress to raise wages and secure the social safety net as he issued an overarching appeal Wednesday to correct economic inequalities that he said make it harder for a child to escape poverty. "That should offend all of us," he declared. "We are a better country than this."

The decision was not solely based on Snowden. The United States has grown frustrated with Russia on other issues, including missile defense and arms control, trade and commercial relations and human rights.

Carney said the United States values cooperation on a variety of issues between the two nations, including the New START Treaty, and cooperation on Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.

WASHINGTON—President Barack Obama announced a series of measures Tuesday to protect parts of the world's oceans, including the creation of a marine sanctuary that would close a large swath of the central Pacific to fishing and energy development.

The plan would require federal agencies to take multiple initiatives to address pollution, overfishing and acidification of ocean water, which is driven by [climate change](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=global+warming).

"Rising levels of carbon dioxide are causing our oceans to acidify. Pollution endangers marine life. Overfishing threatens whole species," Obama said in televised statement to an international conference on ocean policy hosted by the State Department in Washington.

DAKAR, Senegal - President Barack Obama arrived in this corner of West Africa to deliver messages about civil society and good governance, democracy and development. Senegal's message to him was simpler: Welcome home.

The greeting was plastered on signs and T-shirts wherever Obama went Thursday during his first full day of a weeklong, three-country trip to Africa. Although Obama was born and largely raised in Hawaii, his father was born and is buried in Kenya, and on this day Senegal treated the president as one of its own.

The president and his family visited a small slave house on Goree Island off the coast of Dakar, the nation's capital, where it is said men, women and children were traded, sorted, shackled and weighed before being sent across the Atlantic to the Americas.

The slave house on Goree Island is a frequent destination for celebrities and world leaders wanting to acknowledge the horrors of the international slave trade. The walls of the small, crowded gift shop are covered with faded images and yellowing newspaper clippings of visitors: Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as former South African President Nelson Mandela and entertainers Harry Belafonte and Stevie Wonder.

Earlier Thursday, Obama praised the U.S. Supreme Court's rulings the day before on same-sex marriages, but was not joined by Senegalese President Macky Sall in celebrating gay rights. Sall said Senegal is tolerant but that the issue requires greater review.

What do the minimum wage, preschool and gun control all have in common?

They are all things President Barack Obama wants to expand in his second term in office.

Obama revealed these and other goals in his State of the Union address on Tuesday and then spent the rest of the week on the road and in cyberspace trying to rally support for his sweeping agenda.

Employment was a main theme of Obama's speech to Congress, which outlined several strategies for supporting the middle class and closing the gap between the rich and the poor.  He proposed increasing the [minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage) from $7.25 an hour to $9 and investing more in education and job training. He also called for the creation of high-tech factory hubs.

The next day he flew to North Carolina to visit one such factory that manufactures auto parts. American manufacturing has suffered in the past few decades as more companies choose to produce products overseas where labor is less expensive.

Obama said by focusing on high-tech manufacturing, such as 3D printing, the U.S. can win back factory jobs that pay a good, living wage to restore the American middle class.

On Wednesday, Obama flew to Georgia, where he visited a community center and a preschool class, giving high-fives and fist bumps to 4-year-olds. The president urged Congress in his State of the Union speech to make high-quality preschool available to all children so that kids start kindergarten ready to learn.

Obama made an emotional plea to Congress, urging them to hold a vote on gun control. Sitting in the chamber was Gabrielle Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who suffered brain damage when a gunman shot her in the head. Many in the audience wore green ribbons in honor of the 26 teachers and students killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

Obama said the fair is one of the most fun events held annually at the White House. "Every year I walk out smarter than when I walked in," Obama said.

Indeed, Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, joined the president during the tour of the displays, introducing himself to the young inventors and researchers. "Amazing," he said. "These kids are so much more advanced than when I was in school."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama said in a nationally televised address Tuesday night that recent diplomatic steps offer "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons" inside Syria without the use of force, but he also insisted the U.S. military will keep the pressure on President Bashar Assad "and be ready to respond" if other measures fail.

Acknowledging the weariness the nation feels after a decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama said, "America is not the world's policeman."

And yet, he added, "When with modest effort and risk we can stop children from being gassed to death and thereby make our own children safer over the long run, I believe we should act. That's what makes America different. That's what makes us exceptional."

The speech capped a frenzied 10-day stretch of events that began when he unexpectedly announced he was stepping back from a threatened military strike and first asking Congress to pass legislation authorizing the use of force against Assad.

With public opinion polls consistently showing widespread opposition to American military intervention, the White House has struggled mightily to generate support among lawmakers — liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans alike — who have expressed fears of involvement in yet another war in the Middle East and have questioned whether U.S. national security interests were at stake in Syria. Obama had trouble, as well, building international support for a military attack designed to degrade Assad's military.

If diplomacy now fails and the United States fails to act, he said, "the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons" and "other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using" it. Over time, he added, U.S. troops could face the threat of chemical warfare, and if fighting escapes Syria's border, "these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey, Jordan and Israel."

WASHINGTON — While President Barack Obama's popularity has slipped in public opinion polls, he found plenty of support Wednesday among one key constituency: the 566 leaders of federally recognized Indian tribes.

Brian Cladoosby, the chairman of Washington state's Swinomish Indian Tribal Community for the past 17 years, said Obama was "second to none" when compared with other U.S. presidents.

Tribal leaders consider the occupant of the White House one of their own. To them, he's Barack Black Eagle Obama, having received his Indian name in 2008 when a couple on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana formally adopted him. And on Wednesday, they got a chance to meet with him yet again, as the president kept a campaign promise by hosting his fifth White House Tribal Nations Conference.

"He's reaching out to us. We really appreciate that, but there's not a whole lot of things that have happened," said Bryan Brewer, the president of South Dakota's Oglala Sioux Tribe. "I feel there's been a lot of promises to us, but we're still struggling."

Obama and his team outlined their list of accomplishments, including: renewing the Violence Against Women Act, which makes it easier for tribes to prosecute non-Indians for domestic violence; getting an additional 230,000 acres placed into trust on behalf of the tribes; spending more on law enforcement, schools and emergency relief; launching a nearly $2 billion buyback program later this year to return thousands of property parcels to tribes; and creating the first White House Council on Native American Affairs.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama called Wednesday for a foreign policy that downplays military intervention in favor of diplomacy and international partnerships, defending his approach as better suited to a world grappling with global threats of terror.

"This is American leadership. This is American strength," Obama said of efforts to work with Europe to isolate Russia for its intervention in Ukraine and to persuade Iran to abandon its nuclear pursuit. He acknowledged that neither crisis has yet been resolved, but argued there's an opportunity to resolve them peacefully.

In a speech before graduating cadets at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York,  the president sought to rebut criticism that his foreign policy has been one of retrenchment, even as he declared that the U.S. remains indispensable and will strike if its interests are threatened.

Since World War II, he said, "some of our most costly mistakes came not from our restraint, but from our willingness to rush into military adventures — without thinking through the consequences."

The speech came a day after Obama unveiled his plan to end combat operations in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan) by the end of the year. Cadets cheered as the president said they would be the first graduating class since Sept. 11, 2001, not to be sent into combat in [Iraq](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Iraq) or Afghanistan.

A White House official said that some of the $10 billion to $15 billion a month that was being spent in Afghanistan could be applied to the fund, which would also support a multinational force in Somalia, train a security force and border patrol in Libya and assist French operations in Mali. Both White House officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity as a matter of administration policy.

WASHINGTON – President Barack Obama announced plans Tuesday to bring high-speed Internet more quickly to the nation's public schools, pledging to make sure students in the United States have every advantage that "some child in South Korea has right now."

In a video released early Tuesday morning, the president and first lady Michelle Obama announced that the library will be located on the city's South Side, though no decision has been made yet whether it will be built in Jackson or Washington parks.

The U. of C., where Obama taught constitutional law for a dozen years and first lady Michelle Obama formerly worked as a hospital administrator, had long been considered the leading candidate. The South Side also is where Obama launched his political career as a state senator in 1996 and where the first lady was born.
WASHINGTON — The American Medical Association voted Tuesday to declare obesity a disease, a move that effectively defines 78 million American adults and 12 million children as having a medical condition requiring treatment.

If public health experts are to prevent childhood obesity and thereby drive down future obesity among adults, they'll have to figure out why less advantaged kids don't get as much exercise, the authors of the latest study say. Lack of recreation centers, playgrounds, and streets and sidewalks that encourage walking, biking and playing are important, they wrote.

The gene glitch doesn't explain all obesity. It was found in 44 percent of Europeans but only 5 percent of blacks, so other genes clearly are at work, and food and exercise still matter.

Having the glitch doesn't destine you to become obese but may predispose you to it. People with two faulty copies of the gene (one from Mom and one from Dad) weighed an average of 7 pounds more than those without them. But some were obviously a lot heavier than that, and even 7 pounds can be the difference between a healthy and an unhealthy weight, said Manolis Kellis, a professor at MIT.

He and Claussnitzer are seeking a patent related to the work. It was done on people in Europe, Sweden and Norway, and funded by the German Research Center for Environmental Health and others, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

A new study from Sweden finds that teens who received medical treatment for obesity were far less likely to graduate from upper secondary school than their slimmer peers. The gap in the graduation rate was startling — 56 percent of the obese students finished all 12 years of schooling, compared with 76 percent of their classmates.

"The differences are much larger than we predicted," the study authors said in a statement. They presented their results this week at the European Congress on Obesity meeting in Prague.

SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — The violet bottom-dwelling, prickle-backed spheres wriggling in the tank in Gretchen Hofmann's lab aren't really known for their speed.

<img class="pull-right" src="//s3.amazonaws.com/newsela-test-files-f331e/uploads/20130913_Coast_OCEANHEALTH.jpg" alt="Ocean Acidification Chart" /> HILO, Hawaii — It appears at the end of a palm tree-lined drive, not far from piles of hardened black lava: the newest addition to the Northwest's famed oyster industry.

CASPER, Wyo. — These are boom times in the resource-rich Cowboy State, courtesy of an oil explosion whose ripples can be felt across the land.

But critics worry that the prodigious oil output includes a potential byproduct. Despite such fast-dollar success, heavy reliance on a single industry known for its dramatic downturns could one day help paint the state into a precarious financial corner, they say.

Many fear the day when Wyoming's oil market fails, as it last did in the mid-1980s, exposing a fundamental flaw in the state's job picture: The lure of the oil dollar has prompted teenagers to skip college, or abandon high school, for the petroleum fields — many without a Plan B if things go bust.

NAGS HEAD, N.C. — As early as next spring, the boom of seismic cannons will sound under the Atlantic Ocean as the first oil and gas exploration allowed off the East Coast in three decades gets underway.

While federal officials and the oil and gas industry characterize the exploration as benign, Nags Head Mayor Bob Edwards said he's terrified about what the intense sound waves can do to dolphins and endangered North Atlantic right whales, of which only 500 remain.

"I just can't understand how anybody would propose something that's going to be just a rape of the East Coast, endangering whales and dolphins and turtles and fish," he said.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said it will restrict when the seismic cannons are fired during whale migration and will require onboard spotters and acoustic tests meant to detect marine mammals and shut down activities when they are too close.

It's different in the Atlantic, though, Ioup said. Species of large Atlantic whales, including endangered right whales, operate at low frequencies and will hear the booms. An "extraordinary amount of caution" is needed if there's seismic exploration near spawning or feeding grounds of such whales, Ioup said.

Restrictions on where the surveys can happen are made less effective, though, by the fact that the blasts can be heard underwater over distances of more than 2,000 miles, said Doug Nowacek, an associate professor of conservation technology at the Duke University Marine Lab in Beaufort, North Carolina.

"If there's a survey in Virginia you're going to hear it in southern North Carolina — easily," Nowacek said.

Since 2008, oil companies in the United States, for example, have increased production 70 percent, or 3.5 million barrels of oil per day. To put that in perspective, that increase alone is more than the production of any OPEC member other than Saudi Arabia.

Global demand is still expected to grow next year, but by far less than many thought earlier this year. The economies of China, Japan and Western Europe — the top oil consumers after the United States — all appear to be weakening. Oil demand falls when economic growth stalls.

For drivers, shippers, airlines and other consumers of fuel, there's nothing not to like about the drop in oil prices.

For oil companies, oil-producing states, and oil-exporting countries, the oil price collapse is painful.

Oil companies generally keep producing oil from wells they've already drilled, but lower prices sharply reduce revenue and force them to cut back spending on new exploration projects. BP announced last week it would try to trim $1 billion in spending next year in a move that analysts say could result in thousands of job cuts.

A massive tornado more than a mile wide ripped across a large suburban area near Oklahoma City Monday afternoon with winds whipping up to 200 miles per hour. Neighborhoods were flattened into fields of rubble leaving residents frantically searching for loved ones. At least 24 people were killed, including several children.

"It was just like the movie 'Twister'," Lando Hite told a reporter from television station KFOR. "There were horses and stuff flying around everywhere," Hite said, standing bare-chested and covered in mud amid a landscape covered in debris.

The tornado swept through at about 3 p.m., pummeling the area for 40 minutes. The timing could not have been worse since it meant family members were separated between home, school and work, adding chaos and congestion to the recovery effort.

A tornado warning was in effect for 16 minutes before the tornado developed, according to the National Weather Service. Roads were clogged as motorists tried to flee the area. People sought refuge wherever they could — in hallways, freezers and even in horse stalls.

At 3:01 p.m. the National Weather service posted on Facebook: "TORNADO EMERGENCY FOR THE (Oklahoma City) METRO AREA. Large violent deadly tornado moving toward Moore! Take cover RIGHT NOW DO NOT WAIT!!" At 3:03 it wrote on Twitter: "This is as serious as it gets for SW OKC and Moore. Please seek shelter now!"

The Clovis culture is so named because its first remnants were found in 1932 in Clovis, N.M. To archaeologists, the culture is characterized by the distinctive fluted stone spear points it left behind. The points feature a groove that allows them to be secured to a shaft.

With the bathroom formalities out of the way, Evans, 25, went into the gym to begin a workout with her EFT trainer, Jacob Ross. She was wearing a purple top, black tights, pale turquoise sneakers with purple shoelaces and a smile that flashed brightly when her face was not contorted by effort.

WASHINGTON — Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., touched a nerve in athletes and Olympic officials alike Wednesday by floating the possibility of boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia.

SOCHI, Russia—It's a dogs' day afternoon in Sochi.

Packs of mutts roam the downtown streets of the city center and the Adler district. Scores of them have shown up in the new mountain villages the Russian government has built for the 2014 Winter Olympics.

The Sochi Games have drawn scrutiny over security, weather, gay rights and even funny-looking toilets. But perhaps the most unexpected story surfacing here this month is the pooch problem.

While free-roaming dogs is a global issue, it has been spotlighted in Sochi because of reports that Olympic organizers hired contractors to exterminate at least 2,000 animals. That grim news helped fuel interest in protecting the animals, who hang around populated areas begging for food. Most of the canines are friendly instead of the teeth-baring ferals that often run in packs—which explains why a number of visiting athletes are among those trying to help.

"It makes me sad seeing dogs on the streets," said Brita Sigourney, a Carmel, Calif., athlete who will compete Thursday in the new extreme sport of ski halfpipe.

Nadezhda Mayboroda, 39, opened a private shelter called PovoDog in the town's outskirts. She said she has about 20 dogs in residence but is trying to expand.

She has been working for the past five years to get officials to build a permanent city-run shelter.

Bird, the bobsled press officer, plans to visit PovoDog on Monday to pick out which one she wants.

GENEVA — More than 1 million people driven out of their countries by war, poverty and persecution entered Europe in this record-breaking year, migration experts said Tuesday, a symbolic milestone capping a mass movement of people that has challenged the concept of European unity.

With just days left in 2015, the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration said 1,005,504 people had entered Europe as of Monday, more than four times as many as last year. Almost all came by sea, while 3,692 others drowned trying to make the crossing.

IOM director-general William Lacy Swing urged European governments to make migration safer.

While bullying has always been an issue, one of the reasons it is more discussed today is the rise in activity online, said Susan Davies, school psychology program coordinator at the University of Dayton.

"Sometimes it takes these students a little bit to earn trust back," Stewart said. "But once they do, we have — especially in middle school and high school — we have blogs and Facebook where kids can go online and meet each other. They can approach getting back to school safely because they're in their homes and they're feeling safe. They can move at their own pace."

For the first time anywhere, an ape has received the same basic rights as her human captors. The female orangutan, whose home is the Buenos Aires Zoo, was the beneficiary on Dec. 18, 2014, of the decision by a high-level Argentine criminal appeals court.

ORLANDO, Fla. — In the middle of "Blackfish," the scathing documentary about SeaWorld's killer whale program, an activist says the whales in SeaWorld parks die early while their counterparts in the wild live as long as humans.

Yet SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. says its killer whales have life spans equivalent to those of wild orcas, an assertion the company makes to show that it provides a healthful, stimulating environment for the 29 orcas it owns at four marine parks — the largest captive collection on the planet.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced Wednesday the decision to list Lolita as part of the southern resident killer whales of Puget Sound, which already are considered endangered under the federal act.

Mark Simmons, who for two years served as director of animal husbandry for the Keiko-release effort, has a different view. He says Keiko never was able to forage for fish on his own, and that he continued to seek out human contact at every opportunity.

Three main factors appear to contribute to their decline — a lack of food, the buildup of pollutants in their bodies and disturbance by marine vessels. Still, understanding the subtle ways these and other marine-world changes interact only seems to get more complicated.

Meanwhile, these long-lived mammals already are among the most polluted animals on Earth, with toxins accumulating in their fat over decades. When whales get hungry, contaminants may well mobilize in their system, potentially affecting their health and reproduction.

Rhetoric from some of the protesters compared the standoff to encounters that led to the deaths of activists and federal agents.

An Oregon teenager contracted the bubonic plague last month.

Oreos may be as addictive as cocaine — to lab rats, anyway. That's according to new research from Connecticut College that compared rats' reactions to the sandwich cookies and to drugs.

"Our research supports the theory that high-fat, high-sugar foods stimulate the brain in the same way that drugs do," Schroeder said. "It may explain why some people can't resist these foods despite the fact that they know they are bad for them."

The research was the inspiration of neuroscience major Jamie Honohan, who undertook a project through the college's Holleran Center for Community Action and Public Policy where students choose a social injustice and do research related to it.

Honohan, who graduated in May, was interested in the prevalence of [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) in lower-income communities. "Our goal was to design a study to explore the hypothesis that high-fat, high-sugar foods have the same addictive potential as drugs of abuse," Honohan said.

As for why Oreos were chosen rather than a high-fat, high-sugar rat chow, Schroeder said, "We specifically wanted to choose a food that was palatable to humans so that we could make a direct correlation from rats to a problem facing humans."

Honohan said she also wanted to use a product that was common in grocery stores. And, she noted, some research has showed that rats like Oreos.

"Maybe we can approach obesity the same way we address people addicted to drugs, because neurologically, it's the same," she said. "Oreos and other high-fat, high-sugar foods have this potential to be just as addicting as drugs of abuse."

Mondelez International just introduced the latest twist on the Oreo, the best selling cookie in the world. Oreo Thins are similar to the original wafers, except that they are, well, slimmer. The new cookies are each about 4 millimeters thinner and 7 calories lighter.

CAMP BASTION, Afghanistan — Almost four years after the MV-22 Osprey arrived in Afghanistan, trailing a reputation as dangerous and hard to maintain, the U.S. Marine Corps finally has had an opportunity to test the controversial hybrid aircraft in real war conditions. The reviews are startlingly positive.

"With no prior notification, totally configured to do something else and boom, just like that," said Sanders, snapping his fingers. "That's what the Osprey brings to the battlefield."

In a speech in December 2011, McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Osprey engines had been lasting just over 200 hours each, well below the 500 to 600 hours the Marines had expected. That, McCain said, more than doubled the cost per hour of flight, to more than $10,000, compared with about $4,600 for the CH-46. That "is eating up the Marine Corps' budget," McCain said. Osprey defenders say the aircraft's greater capabilities make up for that additional cost. They note that it can carry 24 passengers, versus 10 for the CH-46, and it flies twice as fast. Plus it can perform missions helicopters can't.

OTTAWA, Ontario — A masked gunman killed a soldier standing guard at Canada's war memorial Wednesday, then stormed Parliament in an attack that was stopped cold when he was shot to death by the ceremonial sergeant-at-arms. Canada's prime minister called it the country's second terror attack in three days.

Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings.

LOS ANGELES — At a small community park in Santa Monica, a group of Los Angeles-area musicians wearing dark blue and orange T-shirts with the slogan "Listen Up!" gathered around a flatbed truck as union leaders, a minister and a local city councilman fired up the crowd.

The unrest comes at a time of growing anxiety in the local music industry, where film and television work have been a key source of income for hundreds of local violinists, cellists, trombonists and other professional musicians. Many use the entertainment work to supplement what they earn from working in local symphonies, chamber groups and the LA Opera.

"Every orchestra in the world would love to be doing Hollywood movies, and they've been very aggressive in trying to market themselves," said John Acosta, vice president of AFM Local 47.

There's also growing pressure from studios to save money by hiring lower-cost musicians in Europe, where producers don't have to pay residuals and where hourly rates are a fraction of what they are locally.

For example, musicians in Macedonia might get paid only $10 to $15 an hour and not receive any contributions to health and pension plans, compared with $75 an hour plus those benefits in Los Angeles.

"There's been a downward pressure on music fees, and everyone is looking to save money," Acosta acknowledged. "Composers want to save as much money as they can upfront."

ISLAMABAD — In the wake of a massive earthquake in southwestern Pakistan, the death toll Wednesday rose sharply to nearly 300, officials and local media said.

Crisis teams braced for more fatalities and rescue workers raced to reach isolated mountain communities.

Local television images from the southwestern area of Pakistan's earthquake-prone Baluchistan province showed the tangled remains of people's lives after the disaster — vast fields of mud, bricks, broken furniture, battered household items and traditional string beds. Most houses in the region bordering Iran are poorly constructed of basic materials.

In one video, a dazed man pawed through debris to collect a few meager possessions from his destroyed home.

The area around Awaran has significant seismic activity, given the convergence of three tectonic plates, the Eurasia, Arabia and India plates. The India plate's northbound movement into the Eurasia plate at a rate of about 1.5 inches a year has created the world's tallest mountains, including the Himalayan, Karakoram, Pamir and Hindu Kush ranges, capped by Mt. Everest.

Pakistan suffered the worst quake in its history in 2005, when a magnitude 7.6 temblor killed over 74,000 people.
The school is the product of years of effort by Mohammed Ayub, a Pakistani man of humble origins who turned a promise to his dying father to make sure his siblings got an education into a life dedicated to teaching the less fortunate of this city. For three decades, children who might otherwise have received no education sat through his classes.

"I really don't remember how many have passed through (the school). They must be in thousands," Ayub, who is to be honored Monday at a ceremony in the eastern city of Lahore, told The Associated Press at the field where classes are held. "What I know is that I will continue this mission until my last breath."

"I thought, 'He is no different than my younger brother.' At that moment, I decided to teach him, and that was the start of my open school mission," he said.

It sounded as though Mei was in labor, but she had delivered a cub about four hours earlier. Thompson, a biologist, looked at the monitor, and there, wiggling and squawking on the floor, was a second cub.

Thompson jumped out of her seat, ran into a colleague at the door and yelled, "We have two!"

Keepers quickly began swapping out the cubs so that Mei had to care for only one at a time. The first cub was born at 5:35 p.m.; the second cub arrived at 10:07 p.m.

Both cubs squealed loudly, a sign of good health. "A screaming baby panda makes us all happy," said Dr. Don Neiffer, the zoo's chief veterinarian.

Zoo officials said pandas that have twins often are unable to care for both babies, and one generally dies. The swapping process, which can occur every few hours, increases the likelihood that both cubs will survive.

The panther, raised for 18 months in captivity after his mother's death, crept out, took a look around, bolted down a dirt road and disappeared into the forest, a heartwarming Born Free image that appeared in newspapers and TV broadcasts.

The Florida panther's cramped South Florida habitat holds about as many panthers as it can, and males let loose into this environment are at greater risk of being killed by other males defending their territory. Females typically do better and have produced many kittens.

CHICAGO — Huddling in the hallways and sprawling out on the lawn of the Prospect High School campus, in suburban Mount Prospect, Ill., hundreds of teenagers set aside their smartphones and tablets in favor of poring over the glossy pages of their high school yearbooks.

"We looked into using some video clips, but it's almost a novelty with the kids to have a high school yearbook that's permanent and old-fashioned," Macabobby said. "I also sense a trend that there's starting to be a bit of backlash from students who don't want to be too plugged in. … The kids seem to have a desire to dwell on things a little bit more."

At New Trier High School in north suburban Winnetka, yearbook adviser Kevin Bond said the spring tradition of distributing the Trevia includes a celebration for seniors, with the jazz band performing while students gather to write in each other's yearbooks.

How do you get from there to a 24-year-old woman nicknamed "The Beast," a fearsomely muscled athlete who believes her body can fulfill the most outlandish ambitions her mind concocts?

"I was the first person with a disability to come back, and they were absolutely amazed — from scrawny to how strong I've become," McFadden says. "And very independent, getting out of the car, transferring to my chair, hopping down steps, picking up children. It amazed them, because they've never seen someone with a disability become so successful and so independent."

CHICAGO – On their first day of training, one mother after another paused in the classroom doorway, unsure where to sit or whether signing up for this highly regarded parent program was a good idea after all.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — When he was 3 years old, Mohammad Abdelhamid told his mother that he was going to be a basketball player and – like the pros – buy a mansion.

His mother, Azza Abdelziz, took his ambitions to heart and raised him as a well-rounded athlete. He now plays three sports at Fort Lee High School – soccer, basketball and baseball – as well as participating in a private soccer club that travels all over the region.

Abdelziz, who laughed off the promise of a mansion, was full of encouragement on a recent Sunday as she watched him take on Paramus Catholic High School in an area basketball tournament hosted at Fort Lee. Also in attendance were relatives, friends and recruiters taking in the action as the warm bodies on the court pushed up the temperature in the gym.

But Abdelziz deserved as much applause from her son as she was heaping on him.

Taken together, the assaults represented the deadliest day of attacks in France since World War II and one of the worst terrorist strikes on Western soil since Sept. 11, 2001. At half a dozen sites across Paris - a soccer stadium, restaurants, a concert hall - the attackers carried out suicide bombings, hurled grenades and shot hostages dead in a frenzy of violence that paralyzed the city. Late into the night and early Saturday morning, heavily armed security forces flooded the streets while panicked residents and tourists sought safety indoors.

While the new French border controls were expected to be strict, international airlines and trains appeared to still be operating.

Discussions about what gets covered and why fill entire college courses and doctoral theses, but here's what seems clear: People are more likely to care about the tragedies they feel close to, and more likely to show their concern if everyone else is doing the same.

Many schools held moments of silence to honor the hundreds of people who were killed or injured while out simply enjoying a Friday evening. Some held open discussions about terrorism and the Paris attacks. Teachers of younger students often tried to shield them from the topic.

At Miami's George Washington Carver Middle School, teacher Sindy Garcia started her eighth-grade social studies class with a moment of silence and then showed a video designed to teach students about the attacks. During a discussion afterward, some in the class asked what ISIS stands for and why the group wanted to attack France. The Islamic State militants have claimed responsibility for the attacks.

WASHINGTON — National and state parks will be open for business this summer, but it won't be business as usual: Washington's sledgehammer budget cuts and fewer state dollars will result in overflowing trash cans, closed visitor centers and fewer Junior Ranger programs. Many vacationers will tread on runaway invasive plants, wait in long lines at park entrances and miss out on campfire talks.

And in the nation's capital, the Fourth of July will be a more muted affair on the National Mall, with cancellation of the popular Washington Monument concert — the smaller of two that precede the Independence Day fireworks. The mountains of litter will take longer to collect, due to cuts in cleanup-crew overtime.

Other national parks around the country also have had to make budget-related changes: At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, a $1.2 million cut means that six buildings, including the house where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, will be closed. The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall are canceling evening visitor hours.

To deal with a $359,000 cut, the Gulf Islands National Seashore in Florida and Mississippi will shutter three visitor centers a few days per week and close some restrooms. Most trash cans are history, replaced by a pack-out-your-own-garbage policy. Guided tours of forts will be less frequent, and canceled at Fort Massachusetts.

Once the domain of the outdoor anti-athlete, it's becoming the go-to sport for people who just want a good workout.

Julio Sepulveda, a climate-change researcher, who takes classes in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Mass., said parkour is very accessible because learners don't need access to fancy, expensive gear to get into it. They can simply walk to a nearby park and use the existing environment to practice.

ORLANDO, Fla. — Passengers waiting to board the Dumbo the Flying Elephant ride at Walt Disney World used to stand in long lines that snaked along the sun-baked pavement.

Riders are now ushered into an air-conditioned tent, where kids can play on slides, a climbing tower and a toy fire engine while parents wait for the buzz of a pager telling them it's time to ride the attraction.

"It's so much better this way," Russ Spence of Richmond, Virginiaa, said as he relaxed in the tent, waiting to take his 3-year-old grandson on the ride.

With theme park lines only getting longer, parks like Disney World in Florida are investing big money to make wait time less boring, more comfortable and, in the process, seemingly shorter. The efforts make good business sense because long queues are one of the biggest gripes of theme park guests.

"If you reduce the wait, whether real or perceived, it is critical," said Jim MacPhee, senior vice president at Walt Disney World Parks, which has launched an extensive effort to inject more fun in ride lines.

At some parks, jugglers and other entertainers are dispatched where lines are extra long.

Attendance for the top 20 major theme parks in North America has grown 7 percent from 2007 to 2012, according to estimates by Aecom, a Los Angeles engineering and consulting firm.

Because of the growing crowds, theme park insiders say, the average visitor has time for only nine or 10 rides per day. That means a lot of time is spent standing in lines.

"It's definitely beneficial," she said of the games. "It keeps kids entertained for all the time that they would be standing in line. It's beautiful."

In Southern California, riders of the new Transformers: The Ride-3D at Universal Studios Hollywood line up in an indoor area that resembles a military compound and watch videos that explain their mission during the ride. Guests are told they must keep the powerful "AllSpark" from falling into the hands of the evil Decepticons.

"Guest satisfaction is very important to us and we want to entertain our guests from the moment they enter the ride queue," said Larry Kurzweil, president of Universal Studios Hollywood.

At Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, the park recently installed a 16-by-9-foot screen over the queuing area of the newest ride, Full Throttle. Visitors see a 25-minute video of extreme sports, such as bungee jumping and mountain biking.

Starting this summer, Six Flags Entertainment Corp. also launched an interactive game similar to Whac-A-Mole that visitors can play on television screens, using their cellphones as game controllers. The game is available at all of its 16 parks in the United States, including Six Flags Magic Mountain.

The last lonely bird of a species that once numbered 3 billion or more died on Sept. 1, 1914. Martha, as she was known, had been the last passenger pigeon since her mate George died in 1910. The last of a social species, she lived out her days in solitary confinement in a cage in the Cincinnati Zoo. Her corpse — stuffed and primped — can now be seen at the Smithsonian Institution.

If cell cultures thrive and genetic engineering works, the only remaining challenge would then be to teach the resulting hybrid band-tailed and passenger pigeons how to be passenger pigeons. This will likely be even more challenging than the genetic work, given experience from rearing California condors with puppets or teaching cranes to migrate with ultralight airplanes. That's why Revive and Restore, for one, is not putting all its de-extinction eggs in the passenger pigeon basket (as it were). The foundation-funded outfit might undertake a similar effort to revive the heath hen in Martha's Vineyard, if they can get funding from outside donors. But, assuming breeding, sequencing and cell-culture experiments go well, birds that carry the now extinct genes of the passenger pigeon could be flapping around a California facility by the end of the decade, according to Novak.

These de-extinction projects may prove too ambitious, however. Similar efforts that stretch back 30 years have so far failed to produce a quagga, an extinct species of zebra, although acquiring quagga genetics from museum specimens did kick off the entire ancient DNA field in 1984. And the 2003 experiment that resurrected a bucardo — a goat species that was extinct — for seven minutes has yet to be repeated. Nevertheless, even the International Union for Conservation of Nature has set up a committee to examine how the genetics used for de-extinction might be used to preserve endangered animals and plants or bring them back if they die out.

WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Monday called on Americans to stand up against religious bigotry as he offered his support to the families of those killed in shootings at two Jewish community centers in the Kansas City area.

Tom Whitehead said that all the legislators were supportive of what the family had to say. He said that being from Pennsylvania, many of the legislators have been following Emily's progress, and that Casey shared his own experiences.

With some cities nationwide making renewed pushes for public Wi-Fi after an earlier wave of enthusiasm faded, New York officials say their project is democratizing data access while modernizing outmoded street phones.

Payphones may seem like telecom relics when 68 percent of Americans own smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center on Internet, Science & Technology. But about 8,200 payphones still dot New York streets.

Some were pressed into service amid outages after 2012's Superstorm Sandy, but their numbers and usage have declined overall, and 37 percent of those inspected last year were inoperable.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Efforts to eliminate chemical weapons won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for the global watchdog trying to destroy Syria's stockpiles of nerve gas and other poisonous agents.

By giving its prestigious prize to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Norwegian Nobel Committee turned the spotlight both on Syria's devastating civil war and on a type of weapon that has horrified nations since World War I.

The reaction in Syria was notably polarized. A senior Syrian rebel called the award a "premature step" that will divert the world's attention from "the real cause of the war" while a lawmaker from Syria's ruling party declared the Nobel to be a vindication of President Bashar Assad's government.

The OPCW was formed in 1997 to enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention, the first international treaty to outlaw an entire class of weapons. Based in The Hague, Netherlands, it has largely worked out of the limelight until this year, when the U.N. called upon its expertise to help investigate alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syria.

Friday's award comes just days before Syria officially joins as OPCW's 190th member state on Monday. OPCW inspectors are already on a risky U.N.-backed disarmament mission based in Damascus to verify and destroy the government's arsenal of poison gas and nerve agents.

"Events in Syria have been a tragic reminder that there remains much work still to be done," OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu (AKH'-meht ooh-ZOOM'-joo) told reporters in The Hague. "Our hearts go out to the Syrian people who were recently victims of the horror of chemical weapons."

"They got very excited," says Sherry Branch, SeaWorld's curator of aviculture, better known as "The Bird Lady." "They immediately waddled toward one another. I think it was comforting for them just to have someone else of the same species."

For now, while they heal, they share a roomy fenced and netted enclosure, with vegetation and shade and their own private pond. She hides behind him, scurrying to the far end of their land when humans approach. Pierre runs interference.

"They have formed this very tight bond," Croft says. "So it would be one of those bittersweet moments. But obviously, if he is able to fly, we want him to have as natural a life as possible."

At a local elementary school this month, Kyle moved boxes crammed with pens, pencils, crayons, markers and mechanical pencils with his mom's help. The month-long pencil drive yielded an impressive haul: 3,790 writing tools.

For the elementary school students, the act of giving invited them to reflect on the unsettling reality that an expendable everyday item such as a pencil could be so coveted by their peers around the world.

He can imagine children "being happy because they can write now, that they don't have just like one pencil to use all year," he said. "They can have a few."
LOS ANGELES — If you're in stop-and-go traffic, you're probably pretty unhappy about it. If you're a male penguin balancing an egg on your feet in the freezing Antarctic, that traffic jam is probably keeping you alive.

Emperor penguins are the only vertebrate species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, and they face freezing winds that blow as fast as 124 mph in an icy landscape that can be as cold as 58 degrees below zero. So they huddle together against the harsh elements — and together, their bodies can raise the temperature within two hours to as high as 98.6 degrees.

At first glance, the penguins may not appear to move much. The males probably can't run anywhere in a rush, in any case: The fathers-to-be cover their eggs with feathered skin known as a brood pouch, with the eggs resting on top of their feet.

For decades, humans have built rovers to visit places we can't easily reach, including the moon and Mars. Now scientists have built a rover to explore another challenging target: colonies of adorable penguins.

A team led by scientists from the University of Strasbourg in France have built a rover that looks like a fluffy penguin chick, allowing it to sneak around Antarctic colonies and get close to individual birds without ruffling too many feathers along the way.

Researchers who try to study animals like penguins in the field often end up stressing out the creatures. Their heart rates go up, they react in alarm — and those reactions can have negative consequences for the birds and for the research.

ADDISON, Texas — Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry opened his second bid for the Republican presidential nomination Thursday, pledging to "end an era of failed leadership" and hoping this campaign will go better than his last one.

Texas' white-hot job growth was fueled by an oil-and-gas boom, but Perry said his keeping taxes low, restricting regulation and curbing civil litigation awards helped. Perry also distributed millions in state funds, hoping to lure top job creators to Texas — sometimes with few new jobs to show for it.

Coral reefs have long suffered due to widespread pollution, overfishing and coastal development, losing up to 50 percent of their cover in many places across the globe. Yet most scientists say climate change poses the biggest threat in the future. Warming waters and the related ocean acidification spark more and larger bleaching events, making it harder for corals to calcify and therefore grow and thrive. Just this month the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned there could be a global bleaching event in 2015 due to warming waters—the third in the past two decades.

The National Geographic Museum certainly did and was able to capitalize on its long-standing relationship with Peru and its cultural institutions when it decided to mount an exhibition. National Geographic magazine covered the discovery (officials call it re-discovery) of Machu Picchu, the 15th century Incan city high in the Andes, by explorer Hiram Bingham III in 1911.

For what is likely the first time in U.S. history — certainly the first since the early days of the country — the actual number of American Christians has declined. Christianity, however, remains by far the nation's dominant religious tradition, according to the new report by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20150512_Religion.png" />

Whether a person attends religious services regularly is among the strongest predictors of how he or she will vote, with traditional religion strongly tied to the Republican Party, at least among white Americans.



The decline in traditional religious belief adds to the demographic challenges facing the GOP, which already faces difficulties because of its reliance on white voters in a country that has grown more racially diverse.

The interaction between religion and politics may work both ways. Some scholars believe that close ties between traditional religion and conservatism, particularly on issues such as same-sex marriage, have led many younger Americans to cut their ties with organized religion.

Opposition to same-sex marriage on the part of religious conservatives "is turning off so many people from Christianity," said Phil Zuckerman, a sociology professor at Pitzer College who specializes in studying secularism. "We're seeing a backlash" against the linking of religion and politics, he said.

Almost 1 in 5 American adults were raised in a religious tradition but are now unaffiliated, the study found. By contrast, only 4 percent have moved in the other direction.

A leading conservative religious figure, however, said he thought the trend could be a positive development. People who once would have been "pretend Christian" are now being more honest about their beliefs, said Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Churches should not try to water down their beliefs on issues such as marriage in order to appeal to a broader audience, he said, adding that "almost-Christianity not only isn't authentic; it's dangerous to people's souls."

"I think this gives us a great opportunity for the church to free itself from its American civic religion captivity and to be the church again," Moore said. "The worst thing we can do is respond to the changing culture with pandering."

Because the U.S. Census Bureau does not ask questions about religion, the massive religion surveys by the Pew Research Center have become a chief source of information on the U.S. religious landscape.

The current survey questioned 35,071 U.S. adults last summer. Its huge size allows detailed analysis of even fairly small religious groups. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus six-tenths of a percentage point.

"It's becoming much more possible, much more viable, to identify as secular" in the U.S. today, Zuckerman said. In previous generations, a lack of religious affiliation was viewed as a mark of being un-American, he said. Now "people are starting to see being nonreligious as an OK option."

That trend toward more secularism is particularly strong in the West, where "unaffiliated" is now the single largest religious grouping, at 28 percent, compared with 23 percent who identify as Catholic, 22 percent evangelical Protestant and 11 percent as mainline Protestant, the Pew data show. By comparison, the South remains the most heavily Christian part of the nation.

Although younger Americans are much more likely to have no religion than are older generations, the decline in organized religious belief has affected nearly all population groups — native born and immigrant; whites, blacks and Latinos; college educated and non-college educated, the Pew data found.

The decline, however, has been sharpest among Americans born since the mid-1960s. And in those groups, organized religion does not appear to be gaining adherents as people age. In 2007, for example, about one-quarter of Americans aged 18 to 26 said they had no religion. Today, in that same age cohort, now 25 to 33, just over one-third say they have no religion.

"If you work in the church, you see it happening. We have growing numbers of congregations that are having a hard time retaining their membership numbers," said Bishop R. Guy Erwin of the Southwest California Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, based in Glendale, California.

"The people who are churchgoers are an aging generation, and they're not being replaced by younger people," he said. "We can't just assume that we can do the same old stuff and still be successful."

Swatton has been analyzing Day's stats since 2007. He doesn't rely on ShotLink because as diligent as the volunteers are, he said they're not always accurate. So while on Day's bag, Swatton notes the details and distances of all Day's shots.

"I maintain all that, put it into my spreadsheets and my database and cross reference it with ShotLink," Swatton said last month before the Quicken Loans National at Congressional Country Club. "Every round we analyze it, put it all into a folder and then we break it down per hole, per course."

PHILADELPHIA — University of Pennsylvania archaeologists say they have found the tomb of a previously unknown Egyptian pharaoh who ruled more than 3,600 years ago, the first discovery of what they predict could be more than a dozen tombs from a forgotten dynasty.

The new discovery of the tomb of Senebkay occurred in the process of excavating ruins near the 60-ton chamber. The tombs of other apparent members of the dynasty are thought to lie nearby.

They're more concerned about whether the athletes can do a decent push-up without their body undulating like a worm. Can they do leg lunges without flailing their arms, wobbling or falling to one side? Are they able to touch their toes? Pull up to their chin? Can they shuttle back and forth?

If it sounds like a throwback to gym class, it is. Those movements first emphasized in P.E. — skipping, lunging, twisting, jumping, stopping and starting, to name a few — are the building blocks of high-performing athletes and the key to enjoying all sorts of recreational activities that encourage lifelong fitness, said Larry Meadors, a former national high school strength and conditioning coach with the National Association of Strength and Fitness and author of a paper urging "physical literacy" among youth.

In a small, utilitarian office in Glendale, California, Ron Henderson methodically jotted down equations for Isaac Newton's Three Laws of Motion on a whiteboard next to his desk.

Art historians have debated where and when Monet's work was painted, with many disbelieving the abbreviated date "72" that the artist brushed beside his name. Others even insisted the plummy skies streaked with orange depicted a sunset, rather than sunrise, over the port city on the Normandy coast.

Setting lax standards for schoolchildren in science classes is like teaching them to dunk a basketball on a 9-foot-high hoop, when kids the next town over play with one 10 feet high, the Maryland state school board member says.

It is both his groundbreaking ideas in the field of particle physics known as supersymmetry and his ability to explain them better than anyone else that have landed Gates seats on the state school board and on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. Last year, he received a National Medal of Science from the National Science Foundation, and last month, the Harvard Foundation bestowed on him the title of Scientist of the Year.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Art_Picasso_Hidden_Pa_Edit_1.jpg" />WASHINGTON — For Pablo [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso), 1901 was a pivotal time to experiment and find his own unique style. At just 19 years old, he was living in Paris, painting furiously and dirt poor, so it wasn't unusual for him to take one canvas and reuse it to paint a fresh idea.

Now scientists and art experts are revealing they've found a hidden painting beneath the surface of one of Picasso's first masterpieces, "The Blue Room." Using advances in infrared imagery, they have uncovered a hidden portrait of a bow-tied man with his face resting on his hand.

<img class="pull-left" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Art_Picasso_Hidden_Pa_Edit_2.jpg" />"When he had an idea, you know, he just had to get it down and realize it," Phillips curator Susan Behrends Frank told the AP, describing how Picasso had hurriedly painted "The Blue Room" over another complete picture. "He could not afford to acquire new canvases every time he had an idea that he wanted to pursue. He worked sometimes on cardboard because canvas was so much more expensive."

Experts long suspected there might be something under the surface of "The Blue Room," which has been part of The Phillips Collection since 1927. Brushstrokes on the piece clearly don't match the composition that depicts a woman bathing in Picasso's studio.

In 2008, improved infrared imagery revealed for the first time a man's bearded face resting on his hand with three rings on his fingers. He's dressed in a jacket and bow tie, painted in a vertical composition.

"It's really one of those moments that really makes what you do special," said Patricia Favero, the conservator at The Phillips Collection who pieced together the best infrared image yet of the man's face.

DONGHUI VILLAGE, China — The pig farmer was not in a good mood. Standing in front of barns that hold more than 500 pigs, the man with muck-splattered boots said he's been losing money as the price of pork falls and the costs of feed and other supplies climb.

When some of his pigs started dying early this year, following a series of temperature swings and rains, there was little choice but to throw them out, said the farmer, who asked that only his surname, Wang, be used. Previously, farmers in the area would have sold them to a dealer who bought dead, sometimes diseased, pigs and illegally resold them to be packaged for consumer consumption. But late last year, the government began cracking down on that trade.

"We had no place to put them. We can't sell them anymore — if we do, we will be punished," said Wang, 43. "So there's nothing we could do but dump them secretly."

The chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, has spoken repeatedly about working toward a "Chinese Dream" and a great rejuvenation of the country. But the pigs-in-the-river scandal is a reminder of the distance that lies between that lofty rhetoric and the many grimmer aspects of life in China.

In Donghui, a speck on the map to the southwest of Shanghai in neighboring Zhejiang province, farmers spoke of a lack of money and information. With financial worries never far, locals say the decision to sell dead pigs to shady brokers was not difficult, despite the fact that it could mean dangerous meat making its way to the dinner table.

CHICAGO — At Chicago's main animal shelter, a pit bull mix wags his tail and licks a visitor's hand through iron bars, eager to find a friend. In an adjoining cage, a pit bull snarls and bares his teeth at passing strangers. Across the aisle, another pit bull barks continuously.

To plague aficionados, the Justinian Plague, which in the 6th century AD is thought to have killed 30 million to 50 million from Asia to Africa to Europe, is hardly a footnote. But it is a mystery, deepened by a new finding that the bacterium that caused it—a different strain than that which caused the Black Death and later plague outbreaks—appears to have gone extinct or is hiding, unseen, in rodent populations.

We will likely never see it again, said the authors of a study published this week in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. But they warned there is a lesson in the fact that a strain of plague could jump from rodents to humans, spread, prosper and kill 40 percent of its victims for two centuries, and then mysteriously disappear. New and equally virulent pathogens could appear just as mysteriously, they wrote.

The symptoms that overtook victims of the Justinian Plague were described by the early scholar Procopius in terms that echoed 800 years later with the outbreak of the Black Plague. As it took its toll across the known world, it contributed to the end of the Roman Empire and marked the transition from the classical to the medieval period.

BEIJING — Investigators looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have put away their towed pinger locator and are about to call off searches for surface debris. Now, it's all up to a little yellow robotic submarine to find the missing Boeing 777 in an area bigger than the city of Los Angeles.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/ALPS_AVALANCHE_Edit.png" />SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France — A Germanwings passenger jet carrying at least 150 people crashed Tuesday in a snowy, remote section of the French Alps, sounding like an avalanche as it scattered pulverized debris across the mountain. All aboard were feared dead, French officials said.

The pilots sent out no distress call and had lost radio contact, France's aviation authority said, deepening the mystery over the A320's mid-flight crash after an unexplained eight-minute steep descent as it flew from Barcelona to Duesseldorf.

Germanwings said Flight 9525 carried 144 passengers, including two babies, and six crew members. Officials believe 67 German nationals were on board, including 16 high school students on an exchange program from the German town of Haltern. Dutch officials said one Dutch citizen was killed.

The plane crashed at an altitude of about 2,000 meters (6,550 feet), at Meolans-Revels, near the popular ski resort of Pra Loup. The site is 700 kilometers (430 miles) south-southeast of Paris.

The aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991, had approximately 58,300 flight hours in some 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane last underwent a routine check in Duesseldorf on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.

When that debris washes into the ocean, it breaks down into bits that are colonized by microscopic organisms that scientists are just beginning to understand. Researchers suspect that some of the denizens may be pathogens hitching long-distance rides on floating junk.

According to Schuyler's research, we need to protect these creatures from more than just poachers -- we need to protect them from our trash.

"Turtles can be killed directly by ingesting plastics, through blockage of the intestines or through piercing of the intestinal wall," Schuyler said. They can also die because of toxic chemicals that were used to create the plastic, or that were absorbed during the plastic's journey through the ocean.

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — Major League Baseball plans to eliminate home plate collisions, possibly as soon as next season but no later than by 2015.

New York Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, chairman of the rules committee, made the announcement Wednesday at the winter meetings. Player safety and concern over [concussions](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=concussions) were major factors in the decision.

In a sport long bound by tradition, a ban will be a major step. MLB also is instituting a vast increase in the use of instant replay by umpires next season in an effort to eliminate blown calls.

"What are they going to do next, you can't break up a double play?" Pete Rose said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "You're not allowed to pitch inside. The hitters wear more armor than the Humvees in Afghanistan. Now you're not allowed to be safe at home plate? What's the game coming to? Evidently the guys making all these rules never played the game of baseball."

"This is, I think, in response to a few issues that have arisen," Alderson said. "One is just the general occurrence of injuries from these incidents at home plate that affect players, both runners and catchers. And also kind of the general concern about concussions that exists not only in baseball but throughout professional sports and amateur sports today. It's an emerging issue, and one that we in baseball have to address, as well as other sports."

Even when Pluto was just a point of light in a telescope, scientists had known it would be a fascinating place. Observations in the 1950s had shown that its surface varies widely in brightness, and in the mid-1990s the Hubble Space Telescope created a very coarse map, with a resolution of 500 kilometers, revealing a patchwork of light and dark regions—a heterogeneity that suggested some degree of geologic activity. New Horizons is now turning that crude quilt into a fine filigree.

PITTSBURGH — Koda, the 10-year-old male polar bear at the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium, emerges from a cubbyhole atop the 6,000-square-foot enclosure he shares with 14-year-old Kobe. He steps out to a nearby ledge, his head bobbing and swinging from side to side. He then backs into the cubbyhole, head still weaving, only to return a moment later. He repeats the display, again and again — a 930-pound predator responding to an unheard audience's call for encores.

Such scenes play out in zoos nationwide. By one estimate, 85 percent of polar bears in North American zoos engage in what's called "stereotypic behavior" — actions that are repetitive and apparently purposeless. And while the bears in zoos are closely looked after, critics say the behavior can arise from captivity itself.

But it's increasingly hard for bears to act naturally even in nature. One widely cited reason for stereotypic behavior is that in the Arctic, polar bears typically roam hundreds or even thousands of miles. Yet thanks to global climate change, the ice they tread is shrinking.

Pittsburgh's zoo didn't have polar bears then: Given such concerns, an official told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at the time, "we won't have them unless we have a suitable exhibit."

As at other zoos, Pittsburgh's bears are also given a rotating schedule of "enrichment" activities up to eight times a day. On a recent morning when the zoo was closed to the public due to cold, the bears were in their element: crushing plastic barrels and puzzling over containers from which they extracted iced-up mixtures of fish and lard.

In 2011, police in the small community of Rialto, in San Bernardino County, California, shot and wounded a man who witnesses later protested was unarmed. Outrage grew after cellphone video taken from a nearby balcony suggested that police had overreacted.

The shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August prompted cities and towns across America to re-evaluate the way police deal with African-Americans — especially young men. The decision not to prosecute the officer — and not to prosecute a New York City police officer who choked to death an unarmed black man in July — has intensified civic self-examinations.

The officers answered elliptically, choosing their words carefully: Yes, you can videotape the police. No, police aren't permitted to profile citizens. A "threatening motion" is any sudden movement, especially in the dark. Yes, you should tell police you have a weapon.

Someone asked whether police were permitted to draw a weapon on an unarmed suspect. King said officers may use deadly force if physically threatened by a suspect who is bigger and stronger, or who tries to disarm the officer.

Since the demise of the Gephardt Rule, whichever political party controlled the Congress has generally used the debt ceiling as a political tool, returning to the 1970s practice of increasing spending but also voting against raising the debt ceiling.

Ever notice how robust and chipper former Republican presidential nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain are compared with a graying President Barack Obama these days?

WASHINGTON — The Whigs, the 19th century political party that disbanded before the Civil War over the question of slavery, is trying to make a comeback as the voice of reason between embittered modern day Republicans and Democrats.

Jackson Pollock's mammoth 1943 painting "Mural" — nearly 8 feet high, 20 feet wide and covered edge-to-edge with rhythmic, Matisse-like linear arabesques, muscular abstract shapes and piercing voids, all of which he likened to a frenzied mustang stampede — was something entirely new for American art. The great painting represents an early, galvanizing leap toward the emergence of the New York School of Abstract Expressionist art in the aftermath of World War II.

Adding to the skepticism, polygraphers have documented problems with the measurement of sweat by the LX4000, a polygraph that the FBI and many other federal agencies and police departments across the country have used, McClatchy found. Polygraphers also interpret measurements of respiration and blood pressure for their decisions on whether someone is lying, but many see the sweat measurement as especially indicative of deception.

"The potential for occasional differences to be observed was already clearly described in the published literature, not limited to the Lafayette polygraph system, and anecdotal experience confirms it is an occasional occurrence," the company said in a statement to McClatchy.

A spokeswoman said the bureau, which has polygraphed applicants since 1994, "continues to find it a relevant and necessary tool in both employment and operational related matters."

Hold your nose and don't spit out your coffee: Doctors have found a way to put healthy people's poop into pills that can cure serious gut infections — a less yucky way to do "fecal transplants."Canadian researchers tried this on 27 patients and cured them all after strong antibiotics failed to help.

It's a gross topic but a serious problem. Half a million Americans get Clostridium difficile, or C-diff, infections each year, and about 14,000 die. The germ causes nausea, cramping and diarrhea so bad it is often disabling. A very potent and pricey antibiotic can kill C-diff but also destroys good bacteria that live in the gut, leaving it more susceptible to future infections.

He installed a nearly $1 million renewable energy system in 1985 that used the methane from manure to create electricity for his farm. In 2002, he replaced that system with newer technology, but he hit a snag when air-quality standards called for expensive retrofits to reduce air pollution; he eventually shut down the system in 2009.

In a few weeks, however, Koetsier's renewable-energy efforts will get a reboot as a new company replaces his current system with one that is expected to satisfy strict air standards in the highly polluted San Joaquin Valley.

A decade or so ago, dozens of California dairy farmers built million-dollar systems called methane digesters that convert manure into power. Then, unexpected pollution problems, regulatory roadblocks and low rates of return killed most such digester systems, leaving only a handful in operation.

PHILADELPHIA — Many people smoke after they've eaten. Lindell Harvey smokes because he hasn't.

The poor are more likely to smoke than those above the poverty line.

In Philadelphia, there's a 50 percent higher prevalence of smoking among the poor than among the non-poor, according to Giridhar Mallya, director of policy and planning for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.

The poorest of the 10 largest U.S. cities, Philadelphia also has one of the highest rates of smoking of any big city, according to a health department report.

Until now, most research on popcorn has been focused on practical questions. Food chemists determined that the optimum moisture content of a kernel is 13.5 percent to 14 percent of its total weight. Food engineers concluded that the ideal shape for an unpopped kernel is a sphere. Plant breeders have reduced the rate of unpopped kernels by 75 percent since the 1950s.

Known scientifically as Zea mays everta, popcorn is the only type of corn that pops. Its kernels are more spherical than other corn kernels, and its pericarp — the hull that surrounds the seed — is a little thicker. The starch inside the seed is embedded in a protein matrix called the endosperm, said Devin Rose, a food scientist who studies grains at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

RIO DE JANEIRO — Pope Francis waded into the heart of Brazil's troubles Thursday, telling residents of an often-violent slum that their leaders must do a better job of helping them.

"Here, as in the whole of Brazil, there are many young people. You have a particular sensitivity towards injustice, but you are often disappointed by facts that speak of corruption on the part of people who put their own interests before the common good," the pope said at a recently refurbished soccer field.

"To you and to all, I repeat: Never yield to discouragement, do not lose trust, do not allow your hope to be extinguished. Situations can change, people can change."

It was the most political message yet in the pope's pilgrimage to Brazil, and he must have had in mind the enormous protests that erupted last month among Brazilians angered by government corruption, excessive state spending on sports events, and the lack of basic opportunities and services such as education and health care.

Venturing into the Varginha favela was probably the trickiest event in the pope's week in Brazil, his first overseas trip since his election in March and one that has brought him to his native continent.

"I'm so excited, I'm going to cry," Rosa dos Santos, one of the residents greeting the pope, told reporters.

"This is really important for us," said Milena de Souza, 26, an office worker. "He's a representative of humility and caring and most importantly, true peace, which is something we need here. Because of all the violence we've had here, hopefully, the pope can bless us."

After praying at the chapel, Francis entered a small, freshly painted home festooned with balloons in the Vatican colors of yellow and white.

The folksiness that has characterized the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was on display.

"From the start," the pope said, "my wish in planning this visit to Brazil was to be able to visit every district throughout the nation. I would have liked to knock on every door, to say 'good morning,' to ask for a glass of cold water, to take a cafezinho, to speak as one would to family friends."

He added, "But Brazil is so vast! It is impossible to knock on every door."

And so, he said, the favela would represent "every district of Brazil."
According to tradition, it was in the Cenacle that Jesus ate a Passover feast the night before his Crucifixion, instituting the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion. But Christians aren't the only ones who revere the site.

On the first floor is a Jewish shrine to King David, who's said to be buried in a crypt below. The Cenacle's stained-glass windows are filled with Arabic calligraphy, evidence that it once housed a mosque. A decommissioned minaret rises from the top floor to the sky.

"I've been spat at. I've been cursed in the street," the Rev. David Neuhaus, the Latin patriarch's vicar for Hebrew-speaking Catholics, told an Israeli radio station, TLV1. "I think most Christians who walk around in traditional Christian garb have met with this kind of behavior."

Pope Benedict XVI stunned the world on Monday when he announced his resignation, saying he no longer has the strength or energy to fulfill his duties. It marks the first time in almost 600 years that a leader of the Roman Catholic Church has stepped down.

The German-born Benedict, who turns 86 years old this spring, gave his resignation to a group of cardinals. Now, all eyes will turn to the church's headquarters at the Vatican in Rome, where the cardinals will gather to elect a new spiritual leader for the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.

Benedict's resignation came as a shock because popes are elected for life and are expected to serve until their dying breath. The last pontiff to resign was Gregory XII, who quit in 1415 to bring an end to a power struggle within the church.

The Catholic Church has faced many controversies during Benedict's papacy, including a worldwide child-abuse scandal involving priests. Benedict apologized to the victims and created new policies to prevent future abuse. Some critics said he did not go far enough in addressing the crisis.

Speaking in Latin, Pope Benedict told the cardinals, who are the highest-ranking priests in the church, that he no longer had the "strength of mind and body" to govern the church in "today's world." Benedict is seen as a strict traditionalist, who opposes many of the changes taking place in society, such as gay marriage.

Benedict was born Joseph Ratzinger to a policeman and a cook in Germany in 1927. At age 12, he entered the seminary, a training school for priests, but the outbreak of World War II interrupted his studies. He was required to join the youth arm of the Nazi party and was later drafted into the German army. He spent a short time in a prisoner of war camp and was released when the conflict ended. After the war, he returned to seminary and became a priest in 1951. It wasn't until he was elected Pope that he took the name Benedict.

Some called Benedict "God's Rottweiler," referring to the German breed of guard dog known for its fearsome determination. He earned this nickname for his staunch refusal to compromise on modern issues such as allowing priests to marry, or ordaining women as priests.

YUBA CITY, Calif. — For the swirling flock of migrating shorebirds banking to a landing in California's Central Valley, a recently flooded rice field is providing a new kind of triage station during a drought that's drastically reducing places where they can rest on their long journeys.

PHILADELPHIA — Born in the dirt, the humble white potato has lately been elevated to the main dish in a rollicking debate that is blurring the lines between politics and science.

Congress is pushing hard to get the spuds included in the 40-year-old WIC program, which provides food for low-income women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, and their infants and children.

Saying that the exclusion makes potatoes look unhealthy, the National Potato Council has been lobbying members of Congress — Democrats and Republicans, many of them from potato-growing states — to speak out.

WIC officials, meanwhile, are livid.

Advocates for the poor said they cannot countenance what they see as congressional overreach.

Echoing Greenaway, Zaebst said she worried that Congress was setting a "dangerous precedent for lobbyists from all industries to advocate for foods that wouldn't help families."

Indeed, the economy is on stronger footing than at any other point in Obama's presidency, with growth on the upswing and an unemployment rate below 6 percent. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, cast Obama's proposals for building on the economic gains as little more than "talking-point proposals designed to excite the base but not designed to pass."

Using a sample of 389 healthy children and adolescents from age 4 to 22, psychologist Seth Pollak and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison compared scores on academic achievement tests with tissue volume in select areas of the brain. Researchers placed subjects in a magnetic resonance imaging machine to scan and measure gray matter volume in the temporal lobes, frontal lobes and hippocampus — brain areas that are critical to cognitive processes required for academic success and vulnerable to a person's early environment. Some of the individuals came back for reassessment after 24 months and returned for follow-ups over a period of up to six years.

Cierra Schell, an incoming junior at Philadelphia's High School of the Future, finished her ninth day of backpacking limping down the Appalachian Trail. (The trail stretches from Georgia to Maine.)

"This is ridiculous," she said. "I feel dirty. My feet got blisters all over. But it was worth it. I reached my breaking point yesterday. I fell. I didn't want to get up, but I did it for my team. So we could reach camp and get some sleep. … I felt I couldn't go on, but I pushed myself past that, and I made it."

This West Philadelphian had never seen a mountain, much less climbed one. "My mother drives me everywhere," she said. Nine days without a shower evolved from unthinkable to unimportant. "I don't even smell myself anymore," she said.

Mickai Mercer, 15, melted down. "Sleeping under a tarp with four people I don't even know, it was hard for me," he said. "I cried. I lashed out. I screamed at everyone. I broke sticks and rocks. People would pick on me and make it worse.

"After a while," he continued, "we just all started to get along. I started getting used to all the work that it is, walking up the hills and everything. I started getting ahead of people, becoming the fastest person. I'm always in front now.

"The instructors helped me see that if I stay positive and keep thinking positive, then I'll have positive outcomes. I really started to change. I'm not afraid of bugs anymore. I'm happy and I'm actually really having fun."

"Summer Search says we can't undo the 10 years of academic deficiency these kids are coming to us with," said Amanda Jefferson, executive director of Philadelphia's program, "but we can teach them how to push through life."

"One in seven of our kids have a family member in jail," she said. "I could count on one hand the number of black boys in our program that have a dad at home."

The second summer they often go abroad, on more challenging trips. They have weekly conversations with mentors and receive support until they graduate from college.

But a Stateline.org analysis of new state-by-state poverty data released by the U.S. Census Bureau last week shows that some states with the lowest overall poverty rates in 2013 also had some of the highest percentages of low-income residents living in deep poverty — defined as earning less than half of the federal poverty level, or about $12,000 per year for a family of four.

Maryland illustrates the dilemma. In 2013, 20.6 percent of Americans were living at, below, or just above (up to 125 percent of the poverty standard, or about $30,000 for a family of four) the federal poverty line. In Maryland the rate was just 13.3 percent, the third-lowest percentage among the states plus the District of Columbia.

However, nearly 38 percent of Maryland's low-income residents were living in deep poverty, highest among the states, though lower than the District of Columbia.

There are several possible explanations for the discrepancy. Some point to pockets of poverty in rural western Maryland that are detached from economic growth and safety-net programs. Others point to concentrated economic despair in Baltimore: A recent Brookings Institution analysis found more than one in 10 of the city's poor residents live in areas where the overall poverty rate tops 40 percent, a concentration that can perpetuate a lack of economic opportunities and make addressing the issue even more of a challenge.

It's a reality familiar to Bill McCarthy, executive director of Catholic Charities of Baltimore. He said there are areas of Baltimore where poverty rates top 90 percent and many residents are homeless. In some parts of the city, more than 70 percent of the residents are unemployed and many of them have criminal records that make it difficult for them to get hired. In those cases, he said, the typical approaches to dealing with poverty have a limited effect.

Reaching childless adults in deep poverty can be more difficult because many safety-net programs such as tax credits for the working poor or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, commonly referred to as "welfare," are tied to work, or are limited to parents. Just 4 percent of deeply poor people older than 16 worked full time for a full year prior to the survey the Urban Institute analyzed. Three-fourths hadn't worked at all.

"Most people in poverty are working," said Elizabeth Lower-Basch of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a low-income advocacy and research group. "Deep poverty tends to have less connection to work. You're seeing people there who either aren't working at all or are in very intermittent work."

The U.S. supplemental poverty rate in 2013 was 15.5 percent, the Census Bureau found, equal to 48.7 million Americans. That rate was higher than the official poverty measure — which was 14.6 percent, or 45.8 million.

Mississippi claimed more than $1 billion in EITC dollars. Mississippi taxpayers who received it got an average of $2,817 compared to the national average of $2,300. Vermont recipients had the lowest average payment, at just under $1,900.

The War on Poverty has alleviated some of the economic despair that existed when President Lyndon Johnson declared "all-out war on human poverty and unemployment in these United States" in January 1964. But many of the states that were among the poorest decades ago remain so today, even as safety-net programs have benefited millions of Americans.

The average poverty rate among the states was 24 percent in 1959. But some were in much worse shape than others: Mississippi's rate, for example, was 54.5 percent then. The rate in Arkansas was 47.5 percent, and in South Carolina it was 45.4 percent. Fifteen states had official poverty rates of 30 percent or higher, according to the 1960 U.S. Census. That year the official federal poverty level was an annual household income of $2,973 for a family of four, or $23,800 in today's dollars.

A supplemental measure the Census began using recently paints a fuller picture, by factoring in cost of living and the availability of government assistance. Nationally, it shows a similar poverty rate, but some states with low official rates have a higher rate under the supplemental measure, which is an average of rates from 2010-2012. California, with its high cost of living, is worst at 23.8 percent by the supplemental measure, more than 7 percentage points higher than its official rate. New Jersey and Florida also see their poverty rates jump by more than 4 percentage points, to 15.5 percent and 19.5 percent, respectively.

An analysis of Census data from the Pew Research Center found the South is still home to the largest share of poor Americans: 41.1 percent in 2012, compared to 45.9 percent in 1969. The Midwest's share declined from 22.5 percent in 1969 to 19 percent in 2012 and the Northeast's share dropped from 17 percent to 16.1 percent. The biggest change has been in the West, which had 14.6 percent of poor Americans in 1969 but 23.8 percent of them in 2012.

Louisiana and Georgia, for example, each had official poverty rates of nearly 40 percent in 1959 and continue to have elevated levels today, by both Census measures. Georgia's official poverty rate in 2012 was 18.1 percent, and its supplemental rate for 2010-2012 was 18.2 percent. In Louisiana, the official rate was 21.1 percent in 2012; its supplemental rate for 2010-2012 was 18.5 percent.

A few factors could explain why: The two states rank in the top 10 nationally for share of population under 65 years old without health insurance, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data. Both states also have slightly lower levels of educational attainment for residents than the national average, according to Census figures.

On the other hand, some of the states that were poorest in 1959 and today appear much better under the supplemental measure, underscoring how safety-net programs can keep families above the poverty line.

Poverty experts and advocates for the safety net credit programs that prop up family incomes. The Census, for example, has said 5 million more Americans would have been considered poor in 2012 without food stamps, a program that was part of the War on Poverty, not to mention other safety-net benefits.

"We're doing the best we can to fight poverty, and we're doing a pretty good job," said Timothy Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, who says that debates about the War on Poverty should focus on the broader measure and benefits of the safety net.

The removal of top predators has been called "humankind's most pervasive influence on nature," and it is as detrimental in the sea as it is on land. Consumers prefer predatory fish like grouper, tuna, swordfish and sharks to species lower on the food chain such as anchovies and sardines, providing strong incentives for fishermen to catch the bigger fish. Going after the more valuable predators first, fishing them until there aren't enough left to support a fishery and then moving on to species lower in the food chain, a pattern sometimes observed in global fisheries, has been called "fishing down the food web."

Many of these predatory fish species are known to be in trouble. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species considers 12 percent of grouper, 11 percent of tuna and billfish and 24 percent of shark and ray species to be threatened with extinction. These population declines have implications far beyond a sustainable supply of fish that consumers like to eat. Predators keep prey populations in balance, and the loss of predators can cause trophic (nutritional) cascades through food webs that affect entire ocean ecosystems. For example, kelp forests, home to many unique and economically important species, have been destroyed by a growing population of herbivorous sea urchins that resulted from the loss of urchin predators like sea otters. "Predators are important for maintaining healthy ecosystems," says professor Villy Christensen, lead author of the new research paper. "Also, where we have had collapses of the larger fish, it has taken many decades for them to rebuild."

MIAMI — Archaeologists who for months have been uncovering mounting evidence of an ancient and extensive [Native American](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=native+american) village in the middle of downtown Miami have concluded it's likely one of the most significant prehistoric sites in the United States.

They have also discovered linear, parallel arrangements of hundreds of such postholes stretching across the site that Carr hypothesizes mark the foundation for other structures, possibly boardwalks connecting the dwellings. The village site borders a rocky outcropping that his team has concluded was the original natural shoreline at the confluence of Biscayne Bay and the Miami River, a spot long ago occluded by fill.

"What's unusual and unique about the site is that it's this huge chunk of land where a major part of this ancient Tequesta village site is preserved,'' Carr said in an interview. "It's one of the earliest urban plans in eastern North America. You can actually see this extraordinary configuration of these buildings and structures.''

Carr, who works for MDM, which by law must pay for the archaeological survey, said he has also recommended to his client that as much as possible of the site be preserved in place.

Preservationists note that MDM took a chance when it purchased the property a decade ago because it knew the site was inside a designated archaeological zone. Though the site was covered by an asphalt parking lot for 70 years, Carr and other archaeologists long suspected it was once part of a Tequesta village given previous finds of burial grounds and middens in the immediate vicinity.

SEATTLE — The little boy in a bright-green shirt tightly clenches a sandwich bag and asks, "Can you open this for me?" He thrusts the bag at the elderly man seated to his right.

"Sure I can, buddy," says 92-year-old David Carriere as his weathered hands reach for the bag and slowly tear at the opening.

Not only does interacting with children revitalize many of the residents and allow them access to a more "normal" and varied sphere, it also helps acquaint young families and children with the realities — positive and negative — of aging.

"It's normal for someone to use a wheelchair or a walker, and that's just part of life," Boyd said. "It's not out of sight, out of mind. It's right here. These kids see that every day, and they're not afraid."

Almost as soon as he took the job, he realized he missed being around students. When he read in the newspaper about out-of-control Spurgeon, he saw a chance to get back to the work he enjoyed.

A towering, broad-chested man with full tattoos adorning both arms, Pratt, 29, was among those sketching out new visions: an airy room with a skylight to cure vitamin D deficiencies and a fountain with a cascading waterfall to represent resilience and adaptability. Privacy barriers for the shower and toilet. A healing center with lots of windows and, in the middle, a talking circle with a sun emblazoned in its center.

Most inmates on this 48-man jail pod are awaiting trial on charges of violent crimes. All must agree to participate in a program called "Resolve to Stop the Violence," which involves concepts of restorative justice, an alternative to traditional criminal justice that focuses on healing victims and offenders alike. This day's class allowed them to explore their feelings about the system that landed them here and how its physical contours might be altered.

SAN QUENTIN, Calif. — The scene was almost indistinguishable from that in any other newsroom. Editors sat around chatting about the next issue and tinkering with stories. Front pages were tacked up on the walls, and family photos were taped to computer terminals.

A regular column highlights "an OG's perspective" — OG for "old guard," rather than the more common "original gangster." There are Sudoku puzzles, book reviews and recaps of prison-yard sports.

The paper typically has an aspirational tone, emphasizing uplifting stories about inmates improving their lives and taking advantage of education programs. Headlines refer to prisoners who "promise to work for peace" or go from "criminal life to positive futures."

"It was the first time I was in the paper and nobody got shot," said Thomas, 43, the sports editor.

Before they reached San Quentin, many of the editors' only brush with journalism was as subjects of articles about the crimes that put them behind bars. Each issue of the monthly San Quentin News is a reminder that their lives did not end when they were locked up.

The paper is distributed inside San Quentin and mailed to libraries at 16 other California prisons. And the editors have larger plans.

"We have a vision," said Arnulfo Garcia, 61, the editor in chief. "Our dreams are big."

CHICAGO — Ten yoga mats, foam support blocks and a qualified instructor awaited the women who filed quietly into the recreation room, slipped off their shoes and stood in place on the mats, prepared for the stretching routine to begin.

For years correctional facilities across the country have been implementing yoga workshops and programs, sometimes at the urging of inmates, and the trend is growing, said Gabriella Savelli, director of Prison S.M.A.R.T. The group has helped implement yoga programs at 36 correctional facilities in 21 states, including at a men's boot camp in Cook County and Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill.

Prisoners participating in yoga may see psychological benefits, such as reduced stress and improved mood, according to a study published this summer by scholars at Oxford University.

As the 10 women in one of the jail's residential programs stretched their arms and breathed deeply at a recent session, their satisfied sighs and comments during the class made that clear.

"Lovely. That was cool," said Kristy Montgomery, 29, after completing a tree pose.

Still, for some inmates, coming to yoga just means an hour or 90 minutes out of their cells, said Rick Fahnestock. He oversees the yoga program at the Illinois River Correctional Center, a medium security prison with about 2,000 male inmates.

Fahnestock said he can expect at least 20 inmates to attend the yoga sessions offered five days a week along with weightlifting and pickup basketball games in the prison. Sometimes, as many as 40 men show up, he said.

Because of ubiquitous tight budgets, neither the state nor the city spends any money to run yoga programs at correctional facilities, officials said. For most, offering a yoga class for inmates depends largely on the availability of volunteers, like Kannett, who said she oversees about 30 volunteers who lead yoga for women in the Cook County Jail.

They take different approaches than traditional yoga, Kannett said. Kannett urges instructors at the jail to withhold touching the inmates to adjust their positions in any way. Many inmates, such as those with a history of abuse, could be sensitive to or offended by the touching, she said.

"People who've been through trauma don't like to feel like someone's behind them," said Marcelyn Cole, an instructor for more than five years who's volunteered for two years with Yoga for Recovery.

But the U.N. agency's findings could shake up public health attitudes elsewhere, such as European countries where sausages are savored and smoked ham is a national delicacy.

And they could hurt the American meat industry, which is arguing vigorously against linking their products with cancer, contending that the disease involves a number of lifestyle and environmental factors.

While U.S. rates of colon cancer have been declining, it is the No. 2 cancer for women worldwide and No. 3 for men, according to the WHO.

Experts have long warned of the dangers of certain chemicals used to cure meat, such as nitrites and nitrates, which the body converts into cancer-causing compounds. It is also known that grilling or smoking meat can create suspected carcinogens.

The cancer agency noted research by the Global Burden of Disease Project suggesting that 34,000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are linked to diets heavy in processed meat. That compared with 1 million deaths a year linked to smoking, 600,000 a year to alcohol consumption and 200,000 a year to air pollution.

Doctors in rich countries especially have long counseled against eating lots of red or processed meat — not just because of the cancer danger but because of the heart risks from the saturated fat and sodium.

WASHINGTON – Walkouts and protests by fast-food workers demanding higher wages and collective bargaining rights began last November and spread to 60 cities nationwide at the end of August.

It is an inspiring grass-roots movement led by some of the nation's most underpaid employees, and should be supported by everyone who has a sense of fairness.

As my colleagues John Schmitt and Janelle Jones have shown, the majority are at least 23 and only 30 percent are teenagers. More than a quarter of them are raising at least one child.

> Mark Weisbrot is the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. 

At current wages these high-tech investments make sense for only a few restaurants; if wages doubled they would become widespread. The end result: far fewer jobs in the fast-food industry and higher pay for those who remain.

> James Sherk is a senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation. 

LAUSANNE, Switzerland – Unmanned aerial vehicles have populated both the imagination and nightmares of people around the world in recent years. In April, the United States Navy announced an experimental program called LOCUST (Low-Cost UAV Swarming Technology), which officials promise will "autonomously overwhelm an adversary" and thus "provide Sailors and Marines a decisive tactical advantage." With a name and a mission like that – and given the spotty ethical track record of drone warfare – it is little wonder that many are queasy about the continued proliferation of flying robots.

In rich countries, early interest in cargo drones has focused on the so-called last mile – a tub of sorbet onto a suburban lawn. But the bigger opportunities are in flying the middle mile in poorer countries. Some 800 million people around the world have limited access to emergency services, and that will not change in the foreseeable future, because there will not be enough money to build roads to connect them. By flying medium-size loads middling distances to many of these isolated communities, cargo drones can save lives and create jobs.

BERLIN – Over the last 15 years, the bottled-water industry has experienced explosive growth, which shows no sign of slowing. In fact, bottled water – including everything from "purified spring water" to flavored water and water enriched with vitamins, minerals, or electrolytes – is the largest growth area in the beverage industry, even in cities where tap water is safe and highly regulated. This has been a disaster for the environment and the world's poor.

Obviously, tap water needs an image overhaul. Unfortunately, it lacks the marketing muscle and advertising budgets that have powered the dramatic growth of the bottled-water industry. When a product that is cheaper and better does not prevail, that is bad news for consumers. When the product is water, we all lose.

So far, economists have focused largely on the impending shifts in China's demographic structure. Driven by the one-child policy, the share of China's population under the age of 20 fell from 51 percent in 1970 to 27% by 2010, while the share of people aged 60 and up rose from 7 percent to 14 percent. As a result, the median age increased from about 20 to 35.

It took a century for public policy to respond with an effort to provide universal access to schooling. In recent decades, remarkable strides have been made toward realizing that ambition worldwide. But in an era when technological innovation is once again outpacing education, the effort to provide everybody with an opportunity to learn must not only be redoubled; it must also be retooled for an increasingly unstable and volatile world.

The good news is that there is a growing global consensus on the centrality of schooling in breaking intergenerational cycles of inequality and building stronger, more stable societies. The proposed education SDG reflects this consensus, as it calls for inclusive, equitable access to the classroom. Unlike the Millennium Development Goal for education, which called for universal access to primary education, the SDG calls for universal access to learning – from early childhood development to secondary school and beyond.

Though the number of children affected by crisis is reaching an all-time high, financing for education in emergencies remains outrageously low. In 2013, less than 2 percent of emergency aid went to education and learning opportunities. And though education is clearly a development priority, less than 10 percent of official development aid for education that year went toward children trapped in emergencies.

The extent of food loss is particularly galling in view of a new global study on food security from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). According to the FAO, 57 developing countries have failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of hungry people by this year. One in every 9 people on the planet – 795 million in all – still goes to sleep hungry.

SEATTLE – A few years ago, my wife Melinda and I visited with a group of rice farmers in Bihar, India, one of the most flood-prone regions of the country. All of them were extremely poor and depended on the rice they grew to feed and support their families.

When the monsoon rains arrived each year, the rivers would swell, threatening to flood their farms and ruin their crops. Still, they were willing to bet everything on the chance that their farm would be spared. It was a gamble they often lost. Their crops ruined, they would flee to the cities in search of odd jobs to feed their families. By the next year, however, they would return – often poorer than when they left – ready to plant again.

Our visit was a powerful reminder that for the world's poorest farmers, life is a high-wire act – without safety nets. They don't have access to improved seeds, fertilizer, irrigation systems, and other beneficial technologies, as farmers in rich countries do – and no crop insurance, either, to protect themselves against losses. Just one stroke of bad fortune – a drought, a flood or an illness – is enough for them to tumble deeper into poverty and hunger.

Now, climate change is set to add a fresh layer of risk to their lives. Rising temperatures in the decades ahead will lead to major disruptions in agriculture, particularly in tropical zones. Crops won't grow because of too little rain or too much rain. Pests will thrive in the warmer climate and destroy crops.

NAIROBI – At one of Hanoi's priciest restaurants, a group of Vietnamese businessmen meet their new American partners to celebrate their latest venture. "A toast!" someone exclaims. They raise their glasses, filled with the finest scotch, which has been sprinkled with a fine powder. Not gold powder, as lesser moguls might offer, nor even the purest cocaine. No, this is far rarer and costlier: it is pulverized white rhino horn.

The proximate cause of these precipitous declines is poaching. But the real reason is those businesspeople in Asia. Thanks to demand from people like them, the going rate for elephant tusk in Asian markets is around $1,500 per pound. Rhino horn fetches $45,000 or more. With prices like these, it is no surprise that poaching has become a $20 billion mega-business, reaching high into the political leadership of many African countries.

PRINCETON, N.J. – In the midst of my Practical Ethics class last month, several students stood up and walked out. They were joining hundreds of others in a protest led by the Black Justice League (BJL), one of many student groups that have emerged across the United States in response to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, and subsequent police killings of unarmed African-Americans.

The demand that received national attention was for the university's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, and Wilson College, one of its residential colleges, to be renamed. The college dining hall features a large mural of Wilson, which the BJL also wants removed. Honoring Wilson, the League says, is offensive to African-American students, because Wilson was a racist.

Wilson was a progressive in domestic affairs and an idealist in foreign policy. His administration passed laws against child labor and granted new rights to workers, as well as reforming banking laws and challenging monopolies. In the aftermath of World War I, he insisted that foreign policy be guided by moral values, and advocated democracy and national self-determination in Europe.

Wilson is famous worldwide for the "Fourteen Points" that he proposed as the basis of a peace treaty to end World War I. He called for autonomy for the peoples of the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, as well as an independent Polish state. No wonder, then, that there is a Wilson Square in Warsaw, that Prague's main train station is named after him, and that there are Wilson streets in both Prague and Bratislava.

One of the state's top-ranked schools, it has battled perceptions as a place where money and privilege sometimes run amok, a hypercompetitive milieu where expectations of academic achievement — and physical beauty — are extreme.

Recent controversies have not helped. Earlier this year, the Newport Beach school expelled 11 students accused in a cheating scheme, with one former official complaining that the students' comparative wealth appeared to affect who got punished.

Over the last few days, with preparations under way for the June prom, news leaked of a "tradition" in which senior boys host an NFL-style "draft" to pick desirable prom dates.

According to U.S. News and World Report, Corona del Mar ranks 37th in the state and 222nd in the country, with 71 percent of its 2,440 students participating in Advanced Placement classes. The school is heavily white; minorities make up just 16 percent of the student body.

"We were always told, 'they're high-profile, be careful,' " she said. "There is really a bad culture over there, and everyone knows it's there."

"I heard things like, 'Oh, if you live in Corona del Mar, maybe you'll find somebody to take care of you.' 'Your boobs are nice, but they'd be better if they were one size bigger.' 'I'm on this new detox, I'm only eating grapefruit for a week.'

"When you hear that over and over, it just becomes the norm. 'Yes, we all go on detoxes, we all get boob jobs, we all want to marry a rich man.' "

As she sees it, the pressure on high school girls to look perfect, particularly around prom season, is vastly more intense than when she was a student. "It's common," she said. "You can go on Instagram and find (hashtag)promdetox or (hashtag)promdiet."

NEW YORK — The federal government's proposal Nov. 12 to ban smoking inside and out of public housing nationwide got a decidedly mixed reaction from the people most affected.

Some who suffer from secondhand smoke were thrilled, but others, including some nonsmokers, worried that it gives the government yet another reason to harass or even evict poor people for doing what would otherwise be a legal activity in the privacy of their own homes.

His 77-year-old neighbor, Juan Manuel Cabrera, disagreed. He's been smoking for 67 years, he said, and no federal edict is going to stop him from lighting up in his own house.

She became a widow six years ago. Public schools don't provide a safe environment for her three children. Her income as a hotel manager barely covers living expenses, much less private school tuition. And every two days, she must contend with no running water at home due to austere water rationing measures imposed by the government in response to a prolonged drought.

"This is really negative for the consumer," said Nelson Rodriguez, who runs a family-owned grocery store in San Juan's Barrio Obrero neighborhood. "For every $100, the government takes $11.50. People are going to have to rethink how to stretch their dollars."

"It's sad, really sad," said Blanca Valentine, a Puerto Rico native visiting from New Jersey. "How are people supposed to survive?"

PORTLAND, Ore. — As military helicopters ferry search and rescue teams over the Pacific Northwest, below them are scenes of devastation from a giant earthquake that could strike the region at any time.

Tsunami waters surge through coastal communities. Buildings, bridges and roads lie in ruins. Fires burn out of control. Survivors are stranded on rooftops, cling to floating debris or are trapped inside wrecked buildings.

Seismologists say a full rupture of a 650-mile-long offshore fault running from Northern California to British Columbia and an ensuing tsunami could come in our lifetime, and emergency management officials are busy preparing for the worst.

Federal, state and military officials have been working together to draft plans to be followed when the "Big One" happens.

As a response, what planners envision is a deployment of civilian and military personnel and equipment that would eclipse the response to any natural disaster that has occurred thus far in the U.S.

ST. LOUIS — When the Rev. Al Sharpton called on mourners at the funeral for Michael Brown to launch a nationwide drive for change, Camille Foster thrust her right hand high and leapt from the church pew to her feet.

And there were many people who drove and flew in from across the country, most of them black but a few of them white, hoping to be part of a day that many believed would be written in the history of race in America.

Mourners came from as far as California and Canada to watch the service, which alternated between being politically stirring, somber and uplifting as a choir belted out gospel songs and women pounded tambourines and shook maracas. Men, women and children, dressed in starched suits and elaborate dresses, swayed in unison, danced and held their hands toward the sky.



Scholars at the school have launched the Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project, endeavoring to collect the most complete record of these migrants' journey to the American frontier and their subsequent experiences. The effort has grown since 2012 to involve more than 100 researchers and volunteers in the United States, Canada and Asia, in fields as varied as anthropology and architecture. Together, they aim to generate articles, books and a digital archive, along with curricula and public events.

"This university wouldn't exist without these workers. Leland Stanford was rich, but he became fabulously rich because of the railroad," said Hilton Obenzinger, associate director of the project. "He could create a university because of the Chinese workers who built the railroad."

Remarkably little is known of the 12,000 Chinese migrants who came to build the railways in the 1860s. Many are listed in surviving records simply with monikers like "China Sam" or "China Jim." Researchers have yet to find any primary document, such as a letter home or a diary.

"We have one line of calligraphy in a payroll record from the Central Pacific Railroad" by a worker, said Shelley Fisher Fishkin, director of Stanford's American Studies program. "It's excellent calligraphy, by an educated person probably with an accounting background."

Researchers believe that many of the laborers were merchants, traders and blacksmiths seeking opportunity in the United States after the Opium Wars, Taiping Rebellion, natural disasters and famines. Most of the migrants, many of them educated men, came from the southern province of Guangdong.

"They were not just strong backs," said Gordon Chang, director of Stanford's Center for East Asian Studies. "They were ambitious people making their way. There was a variety of identities; they came from different strata or classes. They had different skills, including cooking, accounting, carpentry and masonry."

In early June, about 250 people came to the Stanford campus for a conference on topics such as railway labor strikes and archaeological findings that shed light on the daily routines of the workers. Descendants of about 50 railway workers came from as far away as Hawaii and shared oral histories, a key source of information for the project.

San Francisco filmmaker Barre Fong has conducted video interviews with dozens of Chinese-Americans, including prominent authors Maxine Hong Kingston and Lisa See, about their railway-worker ancestors. He is aiming to create an hour-long documentary on the subject in affiliation with the Stanford effort.

"Up to now, we kind of have this image of nameless, faceless men with big straw hats," said Fong, 48. "We got some pretty interesting details about who they were, who they left behind and why they left China, and the legacy they left behind in the United States."

Chin Lin Sou, a fluent English speaker, went on to become a prominent Denver businessman. Hung Lai Woh came over as a teenager and built sheds to protect the rail tracks from heavy snowfall. He later ran a cigar business in San Francisco.

See's great-great-grandfather — whom she described as an illiterate "snake oil salesman" — was hired to serve as an herbalist for the laborers.

Many Chinese who built the railroads were not eager to recount their experiences. Filmmaker Fong himself had a great-grandparent who served as a cook on the railroad, but rarely discussed it.

But in recent years, Chang said, many Chinese-Americans have come to regard this period with honor.

"These workers were the ancestors of many Chinese-Americans today. Others see them as their forebears even if they're not related to them," Chang said. "There's a romanticism and a heroism around them now."

The Stanford effort coincides with a burgeoning interest among some Chinese mainlanders in exploring 19th-century Chinese migration. Li Ju, a Beijing-based amateur photographer, has spent months in the United States, tracing the route followed by the railway workers and taking pictures of sites documented by the Central Pacific Railroad's official photographer.

Last year, Li helped reporters from a Chinese newspaper visit some of the sites; a book of his photographs will be published this summer in China.

"I'm an educated person, I went to college, but until I visited the U.S. in 2010, I myself had never heard about this history," said Li, 56.

Historians in Guangdong, meanwhile, are in the midst of an eight-year project to trace migration from the province.

Selia Tan, an architectural historian at Wuyi University in Guangdong, who is part of the Stanford project, said many documents in China were destroyed during the upheaval of Mao's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. And whatever personal letters that survived the purges might not serve as reliable historical records, she said, because migrants often "tried to keep the harsh realities from their family and reported only the good news in their letters home."

Still, Chang says modern technology is helping researchers piece together information in ways that would have been impossible a few years ago.

Each kit, which costs about $15 to $17, contains a small rectangular loom studded with pegs, enough mini rubber bands and plastic clips to make 24 bracelets, and a hook to weave the bands into stretchy, brightly colored jewelry. So far, Ng said he has sold about 3 million kits.

At Learning Express Toys of Naperville, Ill., the area around the checkout counter is surrounded by loom kits, sample bracelets and a screen running Rainbow Loom tutorials on repeat. There are buckets of shiny Rainbow Loom charms, personalized Rainbow Loom supply organizers and boxes upon boxes of rubber bands — a kaleidoscopic array of neon, tie-dye, glitter and glow-in-the-dark rings stacked above the tops of most of the kids' heads.

Now, the icy peak has claimed six more victims in the second-worst mountaineering accident in Rainier's history.

"There is a draw, but I can't explain it," said Len Throop, owner of Eatonville Outdoor, who has climbed Rainier many times but never crested the summit. "From the first time I ever saw it, I felt a connection. Even if you can't see it, you know it's there. And it's dangerous. (Last) week is one example, and it's not even the worst."

The worst accident came in June 1981, when 11 climbers died under giant chunks of ice.

Recovery efforts have been called off for the bodies of four climbers and two experienced mountain guides from Alpine Ascents International in Seattle. The six are believed to have fallen thousands of feet down a sheer, icy cliff to their deaths last week.

"Only 50 percent of the people who try it, make it, any given year," said Grigg, whose email and voicemail boxes have lit up since word of the disaster began to spread. "It's a tough mountain. You need to be in good physical condition, and you need to have training to be safe in the mountains. You need to know how to travel over a glacier, how to rescue your climbing partners."

Like other agents trying to land new clients ever since the Rams' return to Los Angeles became official, he hopes all the dialing will lead to return calls from the dozens of players, coaches and executives who will be looking for a place to live before the 2016 season kicks off.

Kaminsky is one of a handful of such agents in town who specialize in working with professional athletes, helping them find new digs as they move from team to team. All are competing to lock down part of the bonanza that comes with the relocation of an entire NFL organization.

"You've got your 53-man roster, plus coaches, assistant coaches. We'll have 100-plus people looking for homes," said Kofi Nartey, an agent at The Agency, a high-end Beverly Hills real estate firm. "That's a lot of people looking for places."

"Within the last six to eight months we've really revved up our conversations," said Ikem Chukumerije, chief executive of area firm Westside Premier Estates. "It's all about relationships. If we don't have connections to a player but someone else does, they get the business."

That business, at least on the front end, probably won't be that lucrative. Real estate agents make the big money when clients buy or sell, but most agree that Rams players are more likely to rent than buy.

Many players are on short-term contracts, and NFL careers are notoriously brief, averaging a little over three years, according to the players union. So if they have permanent homes in the St. Louis area or elsewhere, they may think twice about buying into the Los Angeles real estate market — especially given how expensive it is.

Aside from the question of whether to rent or own, the other big decision players will have to make is where in Southern California they'd like to live.

Agents are speculating that Rams players will be interested in a few areas popular with pro athletes: Manhattan Beach has scenic beachfront property, and Calabasas has huge homes in secure, gated communities. Manhattan Beach is close to both Los Angeles International Airport and Inglewood, where a new stadium is being built. 

LOS ANGELES — Tony Castillo skateboarded down Fairfax Avenue as he had for more than two years, but on one December morning he noticed something new.

Clasped to the streetlight pole in front of the sneaker store Flight Club, a bright red sign with white text stared him in the face. Though it had the look of a standard street sign, it offered no instructions on parking, driving or walking. Instead it displayed a rap lyric that made reference to the very spot Castillo had just blown past.

Hours later, the 25-year-old from the Venice, Calif., area found himself sweeping in front of his store next door and gravitating toward the sign again. He set his fingers to work twisting off the nuts and pushing hard on the braces to pop out the bolts. After about "a cigarette and a half," Castillo held one of his most treasured pieces of street art.

Artist Jason Shelowitz (also known as Jay Shells) installed 45 of the 46 signs he had designed for Los Angeles County in December, but since then he believes all have disappeared.

Years later, in his home studio on the Upper East Side, Big L's track "Lifestylez Ov Da Poor &amp; Dangerous" started playing one day. The song warns against late-night trips to a park at the corner of West 139th Street and Lenox Avenue in New York. Shelowitz contemplated the lyric, and the seed for the project took root.

BALTIMORE — Ray Rice was let go by the Baltimore Ravens on Monday and suspended indefinitely by the NFL after a video was released that appears to show the running back striking his then-fiancee in February.

The NFL also took action, saying on Twitter that Commissioner "Roger Goodell has announced that based on new video evidence that became available today he has indefinitely suspended Ray Rice."

McArtor is one of the few agents in the Baltimore region talking about his activities — at least in part because using a drone for a commercial purpose is officially outlawed by the Federal Aviation Administration, which is authorized to regulate unmanned aircraft and has been working on rules to govern systems weighing less than 55 pounds since 2008. (Hobbyists are allowed to fly drones up to 400 feet in the air.)

If you're worried about the planet, please make sure your trash is buried in a landfill; there's plenty of space available.

The rate varies by the type of waste, and by state and city. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that we recycle 99 percent of lead acid batteries, 67 percent of paper, and 55 percent of aluminum cans, but only 40 percent of the rapidly increasing quantity of consumer electronics such as cellphones and computers, only 34 percent of glass containers, and 30 percent of plastic bottles and jars.

Seattle had a 50 percent recycling rate in 2014, and 71 percent for single family households, and the rate continues to improve. The city has set a goal of eliminating the "maximum possible amount of waste." Few other cities are so ambitious.



LONDON — Want to sell that masterpiece for a fortune? It might help if it's red.

That's just one trend from an art market that has come roaring back from the global financial crisis, with buyers from emerging markets such as China molding tastes and driving top-end prices ever higher.

Sales next week at London's Sotheby's and Christie's auction houses are expected to generate at least 400 million pounds ($658 million) amid an insatiable global appetite for works by [Picasso](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Picasso), Matisse and other modern masters.

Sotheby's put its works on public display in London Thursday, and there was a distinct scarlet hue to the star lots — Gerhard Richter's cadmium-colored abstract "Wall," expected to sell for at least 15 million pounds; an Andy Warhol portrait of Chairman Mao valued at 5 million pounds to 7 million pounds; a vivid red piece in molten plastic by Alberto Burri that could break the 3-million-pound record for the Italian artist.

Auctioneers are already looking to woo the next wave of wealthy art buyers. Christie's held its first sale in India last month, and Sotheby's opens an exhibition of Indian and international art in New Delhi on Friday.

"We're not seeing any evidence of declining growth rates," said Steve Sillett, a forestry professor at Humboldt State University and nationally known redwoods expert. "In fact, a lot of the sites are exhibiting increasing rates of growth over the last 100 years."

In a two-year span, referees in Utah and Michigan died after they were punched by angry players during games. In September, two San Antonio football players blindsided a referee on purpose, an incident that drew widespread condemnation.

Sol Messinger was just 7 when he stood with his father at the rail of the ocean liner St. Louis and stared into the gathering darkness. But nearly eight decades later, Messinger still recalls the lights of Miami glittering off the bow, so near to him and more than 900 fellow Jewish refugees aboard, yet beyond their reach.

"This is prima facie nonsense," Ian Tuttle wrote Wednesday in the conservative journal National Review. "The first and most obvious difference: There was no international conspiracy of German Jews in the 1930s attempting to carry out daily attacks on civilians on several continents."

"When I get here, I'm so happy," said Matun Myint, 43, a refugee from Burma, through an interpreter. "I don't have any anxiety; I don't have any worries."

The Bhutanese refugees are ethnic Nepalese who fled Bhutan after the 1989 "One Nation, One People" campaign forbade expressions of their culture. They spent years in refugee camps in Nepal before being resettled in the U.S. beginning in 2008.

"These are people who never chose to leave their homes; they were kicked out, and then invited to come here," said farm manager Linda Seyler. "They come with no material resources. When they arrive here, they don't speak English."

Along with reconnecting them with the land, she said, the farm encourages social interactions among refugees and with neighbors at the twice-weekly farmers market.

"You come to the market stand … and there is so much that happens between the farmers and their neighbors," she said. "They're sharing recipes, they're meeting people from other ethnicities — people who use the same vegetables in different ways."

The farm is a boon for refugees' physical and mental health, said Yvette Kyaw, a health promoter for the Heartland Alliance who serves as an interpreter for families from Burma.

SEATTLE — Are Washington employers obligated to accommodate their employees' religious practices — giving days off for holidays, for example, or allowing time to pray during work hours?

The lawsuit before them was brought by four employees of Gate Gourmet, an international company that prepares food for airline passengers, and which, for security reasons, prohibits its workers from bringing their own meals to work.

Yu wrote that her order was based on a state Court of Appeals decision in an earlier case in which a devout Christian woman sued the Battle Ground School District in Clark County for religious accommodation, saying her supervisor told her to relay false information to another employee against her religious beliefs.

WASHINGTON — It began as an irresistible story: a flea market find in the West Virginia panhandle of a tiny, long-forgotten painting by a French master.

The back story was equally irresistible: Impressionist artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir was at lunch in Paris by the Seine River in 1879 with his mistress when he grabbed a linen napkin and used it to paint her a keepsake.

Since the announcement last September that the painting — "Paysage Bords de Seine," or "On the Shore of the Seine" — bought in a $7 box of knickknacks was being put up for auction in Alexandria, Virginia, an intriguing mystery has unfolded with an assortment of characters.

Further compounding the mystery was why the painting wasn't listed on the Art Loss Register, an international database for missing and stolen works.

May's death in 1951 — the same year as the theft — after which her will bequeathed virtually all her artworks to the museum, seems to have only added to the painting's confusing history.

There's yet another twist: The Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., which insured the Renoir and the museum itself until 1991, contends that it's the legal owner of the painting because it had paid a claim of $2,500 on it after the theft. But the company, after initially filing a claim in federal court, has said it will relinquish its claim and transfer the work to the museum, at no cost.

LAS VEGAS — Defiant Republican governors on Wednesday demanded the Obama administration suspend plans to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees in their states. They are charging that screening challenges make it all but impossible to identify terrorists among those seeking refuge in the United States so soon after a series of deadly attacks in Paris.

WASHINGTON — Republicans seized control of the Senate on Tuesday, riding a wave of discontent with President Barack Obama to majority power in both houses of Congress for the final two years of his presidency.

They also held their majority control of the House of Representatives and looked to add as many as a dozen seats, which would swell their ranks to a level Republicans haven't achieved since 1949.

WASHINGTON — When 911 dispatchers get a call that someone has collapsed and stopped breathing, they quickly notify first responders. In hundreds of communities across the U.S., they now also send out a smartphone app alert summoning citizens trained in CPR.

If those Good Samaritans arrive at the scene first, they can start resuscitation efforts until the professionals get there.

The mobile app is called PulsePoint, and it was devised to aid victims who have suffered cardiac arrest. It's one of a number of apps that rescue workers, hospital staffers and patients themselves are using to try and improve responses to health emergencies and help save lives.

About 500 people, including workers, activists, religious leaders, news crews and local politicians, gathered outside the McDonald's on Fifth Avenue. The protesters chanted "Si Se Puede" ("Yes, We Can") and "Hey, hey, ho, ho $7.25 has got to go," holding signs saying "On Strike: Can't Survive on $7.25," referring to the [federal minimum wage](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=minimum+wage).

This leads to a lot of odd phenomena, including the "return-trip effect." You're probably familiar with the sensation: When you go to an unfamiliar destination and come back again, it often seems that the way back takes less time than the initial trip, even though you traveled the same distance.

Now, new research published in the journal PLOS ONE adds weight to the idea that the return trip effect actually exists.

This idea is certainly present in old adages - "a watched pot never boils," and "time flies when you're having fun." It also helps to explain the phenomenon of time seeming to slow down when our lives are at risk. This also apparently happens in our memory: When we devote more attention to a period of time, we tend to remember that period of time as being longer.

This leads to an interesting idea: That by "mindful," or paying attention to the here and now, we can actually slow the brain's perception of time and make our lives seem longer.

But this may not be the whole explanation for the return-trip effect. Some research has found that people can experience the effect even when they're in unfamiliar territory. In a 2011 study, psychologists asked a group of cyclists to ride to a fair. They then split the group in half; one half rode home by the same route, while the other group took an equidistant, unfamiliar route. Both groups reported feeling the return- trip effect.

HOUSTON — Plans to auction a rare permit that will allow a hunter to take down an endangered black rhino are drawing criticism from some conservationists, but the organizer says the fundraiser could bring in more than $1 million that would go toward protecting the species.

"We don't want it to be on our shoulders, to be the ones responsible for the extinction of a species that's been on Earth for millions of years," Lewis said. "I think we should just pull out all stops and say this cannot happen on our watch, and we cannot let rhinos go extinct. We cannot be the ones to let that happen."

LONDON — Nearly 530 years after the death of Richard III in battle, Britain's high court ruled Friday that the king immortalized by Shakespeare as a misshapen, murderous villain is to be buried in Leicester, the city where his skeleton was found beneath a parking lot in 2012.

DNA and other tests proved that the remains belonged to Richard, the final Plantagenet king and the last English monarch to die in combat. He was killed Aug. 22, 1485, at Bosworth Field, outside Leicester, in a climactic fight that ushered in the long reign of the Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.

At the heart of the controversy is the supposed murder of his young nephews, two princes housed and then disappeared at the Tower of London. This supposed act of regicide haunts Richard III's legacy to this day.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140120_Wealth_inequality.jpg" />BERLIN — The world's richest 85 people control the same amount of wealth as half the world's population, according to a report issued Monday by the British-based anti-poverty charity Oxfam.

In announcing the study, Oxfam's website said that what it sees as the growing wealth gap undermines democracy.

Oxfam urged countries to take steps to make certain policies didn't make the situation worse. "When there is growth and diminishing inequality, the rules governing markets are working in favor of the middle classes and the poorest sections of society," the report said. "However, when only the rich are gaining, the rules start bending towards their interests exclusively."
RIO DE JANEIRO — A stout green catamaran plied the polluted waters of Rio de Janeiro's Guanabara Bay Monday alongside the local fishing boats, but instead of grouper and swordfish its catch consisted of plastic bags, soda bottles and a discarded toilet seat.

With limited trash and sewage services in this sprawling metropolis of 6 million people, tons of garbage and raw waste flow daily from sludge-filled rivers into the bay, where Olympic and Paralympic sailing events will be held. At low tide, mountains of household refuse, old sofas and even washing machines are seen.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140603_Rip_current.jpg" />CAROLINA BEACH, N.C. — For much of Wednesday, a small group of volunteers and researchers walked in and out of the surf, testing a new form of surveillance on the biggest killer of beach swimmers — rip currents.

The gadgets float along more or less as swimmers would and let researchers precisely and repeatedly track where the rip currents take them. They also gather other data on the currents' behavior, said Spencer Rogers, the coastal erosion and construction specialist from North Carolina Sea Grant who led the construction of the drifters.

The rip current clearly was happening, with a dark patch of more or less calm water showing where the current split the surf on its way out to sea. The current was weak, though, and several swimmers and surfers bobbed cheerfully right in the middle of it.

The lack of danger actually underlined one reason why the research that could improve forecasting rip currents is important: They are unpredictable.

The currents develop constantly, but a given stretch of beach in North Carolina may develop the right combination of conditions — such as wave size and frequency, tides and sandbar shape — to create lethally strong ones only five to 10 days a year, said Rogers.

That, Brander said, started a debate among experts about whether to continue telling people to swim parallel to shore or to float and wait.

At a Senate hearing Wednesday, lawmakers grappled with the policy implications and risks posed by the latest advancements in vehicle technology, and pondered what rules or standards might be needed nationwide.

HUNTERSVILLE, N.C. — It took a group of Huntersville Elementary School third-graders roughly 10 minutes to build a pyramid using plastic cups as part of a team-building exercise. The challenge is that they cannot touch the cups with their hands and can only use a rubber band attached to several strings.

Students are tasked with creating something with commercial value. It can be something new, or they can choose to improve on something that already exists.

The classes haven't committed to a specific project yet, but ideas range from lofty (creating a skateboard that teaches people how to learn) to fun (a remote-controlled car) to practical and educational. The competition will be held May 30.

Last year, six teams of roughly 10 students each participated. Walters, who was teaching at another school at the time, and her class took home second place by creating an electric guitar. The winners made an automatic dog-feeder.

Fanciful illustrations from a circa-1530 manual on artillery and siege warfare seem to show jet packs strapped to the backs of cats and doves, with the German-language text helpfully advising military commanders to use them to "set fire to a castle or city which you can't get at otherwise."

WOODSTOCK, N.Y. — It's a syllabus you can head bang to.

A team of cardiovascular researchers at the esteemed clinic in Rochester, Minn., reported that a single can of Rockstar energy drink can boost your blood pressure and cause the fight-or-flight hormone norepinephrine to increase in just 30 minutes.

Even so, the findings caused the researchers to fret. The increases in blood pressure and norepinephrine after consuming an energy drink may make people more vulnerable to cardiovascular problems, they wrote in a study published online Sunday by the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Rodman's squad — featuring ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker — will play against a team of North Koreans on Wednesday, which is believed to be Kim's birthday. The former NBA players, who arrived in Pyongyang on Monday, also include Eric "Sleepy" Floyd, guard Doug Christie and Charles D. Smith, who played for the New York Knicks. Four streetballers are also on the squad.

Rodman told The Associated Press he was glad to be in North Korea for the game, though he said he has gotten death threats for his repeated visits. He said proceeds from the game would go to a charity for the deaf in North Korea.

"The marshal is actually trying to change this country in a great way," Rodman said of Kim, using the leader's official title. "I think that people thought that this was a joke, and Dennis Rodman is just doing this because fame and fortune." Instead, he said, he sees the game as a "birthday present" for Kim and his country.

The story of Leonarda Dibrani's expulsion from France took a surprising turn. Hundreds of French students and supporters flooded the streets of Paris to demand that she be allowed to return in what many thought might mark a turning point in deeply negative views Europeans hold of their centuries-old neighbors.

Rooftop farms are popping up around the city, from the McCormick Place convention center, which has grown tens of thousands of pounds of produce since 2013, to a historic Pullman neiborhood factory — expected to have the world's largest operation when it's completed this summer — to small businesses and educational programs.

FORT WORTH, Texas — Fleeing rural poverty in Kentucky, Rose Will Monroe piled her son and daughter into a bus in 1942, not long after her husband was killed in a car wreck.

So Monroe, a "tomboy" daughter of a carpenter, went to work wielding a 6.8-pound rivet hammer on the mammoth assembly line devised by Henry Ford to produce B-24 bombers.

Rubio faces steep challenges to the nomination, including a well-funded one that Bush is expected to offer. The son of one president and brother of another, Jeb Bush was governor while Rubio was speaker of the Florida House. The two formed a close bond, but a presidential campaign was certain to test the strength of their friendship.

After the U.S. and the European Union ratcheted up sanctions against Russia last month, retaliation was expected. Sanderson's sales force actively sought new markets for dark chicken and turkey meat for weeks before Wednesday's announced retaliation.

"We don't sell chicken to Putin. We sell chicken to Russian consumers, and they are going to be the ones that suffer from this," predicted Cockrell. "If that's what Putin wants to do, it's his consumers suffering as a result."

"What the Russians have done here is essentially to impose sanctions on their own people," David Cohen, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a call with reporters.

Russia's government is limiting access to food, a move, said Cohen, "that the U.S. and our allies would never do."

"I have nothing anymore, nowhere to go, no apartment … and all my documents and personal belongings were burned," Poludnitsina, 25, said as she sat in a tent she shares with a family of four.

The population dropped to 130 in recent weeks as many refugees found shelter with friends, relatives or host families or managed to rent apartments. Most who remain lack passports or other official documents that would allow them to move on or be resettled by the Russian government in cities elsewhere, said Natalya Vyacheslavovna Kim, a senior camp manager.

"We wash our hair with cold water," said Yevgenia Melikyan, 35, who arrived at the camp from Luhansk in early August with her 76-year-old father and teenage son and daughter. "Mothers heat the water to bathe their children."

There are no books, no television, no Internet. Youngsters play in the dirt. Many appear frightened by loud noises, camp administrators said.

Meals include millet porridge enhanced with stewed canned meat. Poludnitsina said she longed for a hot dog.

LONDON — Russian football is plagued by a racist and far-right extremist fan culture that threatens the safety of visitors to the 2018 World Cup, according to a report provided to The Associated Press.

Rwanda has made stunning progress since what was one of the 20th century's greatest crimes, when more than 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were slaughtered by Hutu extremists. Life expectancy has doubled since 1994 to more than 60 years. Economic growth consistently reaches 8 percent annually. And the number of deaths of children under 5 has plummeted in the past two decades from 230 per 1,000 to 55.

Kagame says that improved education and an end to poverty are the most effective ways to prevent a return of violence. The government spends a quarter of its budget on health and 17 percent on education, according to the World Bank.

"We must work hard because if we wait for others to develop our country, we will not make progress," Kagame said last month. "Any external help must only come as an addition to our own efforts to better ourselves."
WASHINGTON - Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, was elected speaker of the House Thursday and proceeded to declare the institution he now leads "broken" and in need of reform.

Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-California), who abandoned his own hopes of becoming speaker earlier this month in the face of conservative opposition, said Ryan would be able to meet those challenges: "The future looks brighter," he said Thursday. "Yeah, there's work involved in that, but the hurdles are not as high as they were a week ago."

The demonstration was the latest skirmish in Jerusalem's long-running "Sabbath wars," which for decades have pitted the city's secular Jewish population against its ultra-Orthodox community over whether shops, theaters and other public spaces can remain open on the Jewish day of rest.

Mostly Jewish West Jerusalem essentially shuts down every Friday afternoon, in keeping with Orthodox strictures that prohibit observant Jews from working on the Sabbath. Stores are closed, bus service is suspended and cars are banned from the streets in and around many neighborhoods. Some ultra-Orthodox, who tend to vote as a bloc in city elections and are heavily represented on the city council, have thrown stones at drivers who challenge the status quo.

BILLINGS, Mont. — American Indians across the Western U.S. are challenging moves by federal wildlife officials to lift protections for grizzly bears that roam a vast wilderness centered on Yellowstone National Park, citing worries over potential trophy hunting of a species many tribes consider sacred.

A former chairman of Arizona's Hopi Tribe, Ben Nuvamsa, says his people regard the grizzly as an "uncle" who possesses strong healing powers and plays a central role in traditional ceremonies. He said tribes want to "keep it from being a trophy animal and prevent the industrialization of bear habitat."

"We regard him as part of our family, and it's really important to all of us natives to keep him around," Nuvamsa added. "It doesn't matter where the bears are. We pray to them when we see them."

A decision on whether to propose a rule to lift protections is expected in the next several months. No such proposal is pending for the only other large concentration of grizzlies in the Lower 48, an area around Glacier National Park in northwest Montana and southern Canada with an estimated 1,000 bears.

Salem's witch trials started in January of 1692, when the 9-year-old Elizabeth Parris and her 11-year-old cousin Abigail Williams — the daughter and niece of Salem's minister — began having strange fits. A doctor diagnosed the cause as supernatural, and under pressure from local officials, the girls blamed three local women for their affliction.

The hysteria was contagious, as was the girls' mysterious illness, apparently. Before long, the "affliction" spread to nearly a dozen girls, and more than 200 people would be accused of witchcraft, according to Smithsonian Magazine.

The turmoil among judges was just one piece of the convulsion, celebration, rebellion and, sometimes, bored shrugs that swept the state in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to stay U.S. District Judge Callie Granade's order, opening the way for gay marriages in Alabama.

"I'm going to talk about this on a regular basis. And I will politicize this. Because our inaction is a political decision that we're making," Obama said at a news conference. "Unless we change that political dynamic, we're not going to be able to make a big dent in this problem."

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — The term "sanctuary city" has become a rallying cry for conservative Republicans seeking stiffer immigration laws. They characterize such places as havens where those in the country illegally are protected from immigration authorities.

While notably liberal San Francisco has openly declared itself a haven for all immigrants regardless of their legal status, some of the cities and counties that have stopped detaining immigrants for ICE are politically conservative and are not trying to shield residents from deportation.

The localities span a broad spectrum on how far they go to welcome immigrants or whether they're trying to assist them at all. A big distinction is the reasoning behind local detainer policies. Places like Cook County, Illinois, and Santa Clara County, California, are trying to cultivate trust of police in immigrant communities. Others, such as San Bernardino and Riverside counties in California, cite fear of getting sued.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the anti-illegal immigration Center for Immigration Cities, acknowledged the difference but said the net effect was similar whether a city wanted to work with ICE or not.

"Some may cooperate here but not there. Some may cooperate on certain matters but not other matters. But any jurisdiction that does not cooperate fully with federal immigration authorities seems to me qualifies as a sanctuary city," he said.

In the Orange County jail, deputies regularly interview immigrants about their legal status as part of a close collaboration with federal immigration agents. They tell them when someone they've flagged for possible deportation is due to be released. But the agency doesn't hold people on the detainers due to legal concerns, said Steve Kea, assistant sheriff of custody operations.

"What we're seeing in our rallies and in social media and in every metric that's out there is that young people are, many of them for the first time in their lives, getting really excited about the senator's candidacy," Pennington said. "And it's not because the senator is some cool hip guy, it's just because his ideas are really appealing to millennials." Sanders will likely use the account to focus on issues young voters care about, such as college costs, LGBT rights, and racial justice, Pennington said.

WASHINGTON - Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's front-runner status in the Democratic presidential primary fight was jolted Wednesday by a new and unexpected vulnerability: a financial one. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/AP_204149746782.jpg" />

The more than $28 million that Clinton's campaign announced Wednesday it had raised in the third quarter was nearly matched by the $26 million that Sen. Bernie Sanders brought in, thanks to small contributions that came in for him at a faster clip than even in President Obama's campaigns.

While the ever-secretive company has been mum on its plans, Apple has been stockpiling patents regarding its use and signed a $578 million deal with a specialized manufacturer to grow a synthetic version of the mineral at a massive Mesa, Arizona, plant. The facility will pump out more sapphire than the rest of the producers in the world combined when it reaches full capacity, said Eric Virey, an analyst at research company Yole Développement.

Touch-screen technology is already sophisticated, but analysts see ample room for improvement. With a sapphire screen, Apple might be able to extend fingerprint sensing across the display. That could make mobile payments easier by letting users register the prints of multiple fingers or sign their signature more easily on their smartphone screens, Margolis said.

Analysts say smartphone manufacturers will be watching Apple as they assess whether to use sapphire in their own devices. Of course, if sapphire spreads across the market, Apple would have to find a new way to wow consumers. Could a diamond-encrusted screen be next?

LOS ANGELES — The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish.

"Tonight's pretty reflective of how things have been going," Hanson said. "Not very well."

To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food.

If sardines don't recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast's marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years.

The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools.

Tickets sold so quickly that Cinemark and other chains showing the episode had to add theaters to keep up with demand. The event convinced Warner that what happened with "Dr. Who" was just the tip of the iceberg in terms of TV shows, sports programs and other types of so-called alternative entertainment that could help redefine the way Americans think about the multiplex.

Theaters have been experimenting for several years with alternative programming, helping to fill up normally empty theaters during slow midweek periods. They've enjoyed success with sold-out screenings of the Metropolitan Opera, World Cup soccer games in 3-D, boxing matches and mixed martial arts bouts.

Until recently, however, technological hurdles limited the screenings to a few hundred theaters at a time, making it costly to program such content.

With the expanding satellite network, theater executives such as Warner are broadening their conversations with the heads of major studios, pitching them on the idea of the multiplex as a kind of vast TV network that could be programmed with specialized content, whether it be a live screening of "American Idol" or an NCAA championship basketball game.

There is no specific law to prevent women from driving in the kingdom, but they cannot apply for driving licenses and have previously been arrested on charges relating to public order or political protest after getting behind the wheel.

The photos and footage showed various women driving on busy streets in the capital Riyadh. One clip, dated Wednesday, showed a woman driving in the traditional veil, with only her eyes showing, as other motorists slowed and gave a thumbs-up sign.

MECCA, Saudi Arabia — Muslims from across the world poured Sunday into a sprawling tent city in the Saudi desert before the start of the annual Islamic hajj pilgrimage, but the number of the pilgrims this year has been reduced in part by concerns over a respiratory virus centered in the Arabian peninsula.

More than 2 million pilgrims — about 1 million fewer than last year — streamed from the holy city of Mecca to a huge tent encampment in Mina about 5 kilometers (3 miles) away to begin preparations for the hajj with a day of prayer and supplication.

Saudi authorities sharply cut back on visas for groups such as the elderly, pregnant women and those with chronic illnesses as a precaution against a new respiratory virus related to SARS that has killed more than 50 people in the kingdom this past year. The Saudi health minister, Abdullah al-Rabiah, said late Saturday that no cases of the coronavirus infection have been detected among pilgrims.

This year, though, some pilgrims are wearing masks as a precaution against the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which has stricken nearly 100 people, most of them in Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. The new virus is related to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed hundreds in a global outbreak in 2003. It belongs to a family of viruses that most often causes the common cold.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A growing number of men are quietly helping steer a campaign to end Saudi Arabia's ban on allowing women to drive, risking their jobs and social condemnation in the conservative kingdom.

Some of the men have even been questioned by authorities, and one was detained by a branch of the Saudi Interior Ministry — a move that sent a chill through some of the activists working to put women behind the wheel.

On Saturday, more than 60 women said they defied the ban, although they faced little action from police.

"They don't want women driving because it opens the door to a flood of other demands that will lead to calls for political reforms," he said. "It will evolve from a call for the rights of a segment of society to the rights of all society."

King Abdullah has gradually introduced reforms in Saudi Arabia, allowing women to sit on the national advisory council and permitting them to vote and run in municipal elections. But the stringent male guardian system is still in place, requiring women to obtain permission from a male relative to travel, get married, enroll in higher education or undergo surgery in some cases.

Rather than arrest the women, which could lead to an international outcry — as was the case in 2011 and 1990 — authorities have instead increased pressure on their male supporters. A handful of men have been questioned since Saturday, activists said, and other campaigners have had to sign pledges not to allow their female relatives to drive again.

On Sunday, elementary school teacher Tariq al-Mubarak was detained by the Interior Ministry's Criminal Investigation Department in Riyadh, although he has not been charged, said his lawyer, Abdel-Aziz al-Qassem.

A male campaigner who asked not to be identified for fear of losing his job at a multinational company in Saudi Arabia said he is afraid he may be detained before his upcoming wedding. He said he closed his Twitter account at the request of his worried fiancé.

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — When Sofana Dahlan wanted to study law, she had to go to Egypt to do it. The subject wasn't offered to women at universities in her native Saudi Arabia.

The so-called Saudization program, an attempt to reduce unemployment among the growing number of young Saudis entering the workforce, has opened doors to women in sectors that can accommodate the kingdom's strict rules on gender segregation, said Steffen Hertog, an expert on labor reform at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Women's basketball is gaining in popularity in a kingdom rife with public restrictions on female movement and activity. With the help of some U.S.-trained coaches, female enthusiasts are using basketball to push for greater rights for women on and off the courts in Saudi Arabia.

"We are an activist team," said Lina Almaeena, who started the first women's basketball team here 11 years ago. That led to the creation of Jiddah United in 2006, the first sports club in Saudi Arabia to include women. "We took it upon ourselves to really promote the sport at a time when it was a big time taboo ... when there was a self-imposed censorship on women's sports."

For now, women's basketball in Saudi Arabia remains a fringe phenomenon, but for enthusiastic players and parents, its presence is a much-welcome source of both exercise and confidence-building life lessons.

The mass transit options are notoriously poor. The cost of hiring a chauffeur was prohibitive. And she didn't want to deal with the negative comments she would face if she tried to hail a cab in the conservative kingdom, where a woman using public transportation on her own is often seen as lacking morals.

The cost is slightly higher than for a taxi, but she finds the apps safer and more reliable. Both Uber and Careem use GPS technology to track their cars. With a few taps, she can see who will be driving her, the type of vehicle he uses and his customer ratings.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — The swirling lines from Linden Bateman's pen have been conscripted into a national fight to keep cursive writing in American classrooms.

"Modern research indicates that more areas of the human brain are engaged when children use cursive handwriting than when they keyboard," said Bateman, who handwrites 125 ornate letters each year. "We're not thinking this through. It's beyond belief to me that states have allowed cursive to slip from the standards."

Since the 1990s, educators and parents have demanded "zero tolerance" policies in response to school shootings, drugs and gang tensions. Creating safe schools became a mantra for elected school boards. One result has been the deployment of an estimated 14,000 officers on campuses across the country, a number of them carrying weapons, and a number of them now tasked with duties that go well beyond holding shooters and gangsters at bay.

PHILADELPHIA — Christopher Gray couldn't even afford college application fees, let alone tuition. His single mother was out of work, and there were two siblings to think about, then ages 2 and 3.

He received 34 scholarships worth $1.3 million — enough to get his bachelor's, his master's, and his doctorate, plus cover his living expenses with some left over to invest. Now, Gray — since dubbed "the Million Dollar Scholar" — has found a way to help other teens find scholarship money. He and two associates have developed a mobile app called Scholly — shorthand for "scholarships" — for both the iPhone and Android.

Instead of providing low-income students free or reduced-price meals in the cafeteria, they're increasingly serving all children in the classroom. Food policy advocates say the change increases equity, however, it's fueled a backlash from parents and teachers. They contend that it takes up class time that should be devoted to learning and wastes food by serving it to kids who don't want or need it.

WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Wednesday pressed the nation's schools to abandon what it described as overly zealous discipline policies that send students to court instead of the principal's office. Even before the announcement, school districts around the country have been taking action to adjust the policies that disproportionately affect minority students.

Attorney General Eric Holder said problems often stem from well-intentioned "zero-tolerance" policies that can inject the criminal justice system into school matters.

"A routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal's office, not in a police precinct," Holder said.

"In our investigations, we have found cases where African-American students were disciplined more harshly and more frequently because of their race than similarly situated white students," the Justice Department and Education Department said in the letter to school districts. "In short, racial discrimination in school discipline is a real problem."

The federal school discipline recommendations are nonbinding. They encourage schools to ensure that all school personnel are trained in classroom management, conflict resolution and approaches to de-escalate classroom disruptions — and understand that they are responsible for administering routine student discipline instead of security or police officers.

In many parts of the country, there already has been a shift toward recognizing that school discipline polices can be discriminatory, said Judith Browne Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a think tank that specializes in social issues affecting minority communities.

BATES COUNTY, Mo. — Ever-increasing global competition in job markets and research fields has pumped up pressure on American schools to churn out smarter and better-prepared students.

Some education experts advocate year-round schools. Others say we need longer school days. Some schools have even added Saturday classes.

But a growing number of school districts across the country are trying a different strategy. In fact, they're going in a completely different direction. They are taking Mondays off.

Students go longer Tuesday through Friday because they still must meet state minimums for classroom hours. And while they don't attend class on Mondays, teachers do. They come in for staff development, lesson planning and technology training.

"Our ACT scores are the best they've been in 10 years, and our teachers love it," said Chris Fine, superintendent of the Lathrop school district in Clinton County, which went to four days in 2010. It was the first district in Missouri to do so after the General Assembly passed legislation a year earlier.

Most of these are small, rural districts, such as Miami R-1, about an hour south of Kansas City. Its one school building, serving all grades, is surrounded by head-high corn this time of year and has so few students the boys play football for another school in a nearby town. Eagles by day, Bobcats on Friday night.

A 2013 report showed about 40 percent of the school's students were overweight or obese, Glassock said. Across the country, the obesity rate in children ages 2 to 19 has held around 17 percent for the last decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The kindergarten through second-graders help one another work the device and explain tough concepts — without the pressure to earn an A or fear of receiving an F. Grades don't mean much to Barrett, a veteran teacher. An A-plus in reading, for instance, won't tell parents how well their child can pronounce words with silent letters, just as a C or F can't explain how well a child understands vowels, she said.

"Just because they got an A or a 92 on their report card in no way tells a parent exactly what they did," she said. "All that tells you is a number. It doesn't really give you any kind of depth of knowledge as to what they know."

Barrett has a master's degree in early-childhood education and is constantly tweaking the class. Her room is stockpiled with iPads, storybooks, fish tanks, snacks — even hula hoops.

"Much of the country does not have sufficient coverage of school nurses," she said. "This means that school nurses are covering multiple schools, so they rely on secretaries and unlicensed personnel, even teachers and principals, to step in and do the daily duties a school nurse would do."

Nurses help children manage chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes and seizures so they don't miss school. They also treat injuries and counsel students about physical and emotional issues.

WASHINGTON — Black students are more likely to be suspended from U.S. public schools — even as tiny preschoolers.

Black children represent about 18 percent of children in preschool programs in schools, but they make up almost half of the preschoolers suspended more than once, the report said. Six percent of the nation's districts with preschools reported suspending at least one preschool child.

HARTFORD, Conn. — Taking a harder line on crimes no longer seen as juvenile pranks, state lawmakers around the United States are proposing stiffer penalties for people who threaten schools at a time of fears over terrorism and mass shootings.

While most states already have laws that allow prosecution of a school threat as a felony, there have been proposals across the U.S. to increase punishments, said Michael Dorn, executive director of the school safety nonprofit group Safe Havens International.

An analysis by National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland, Ohio-based consulting firm, found a 158 percent increase in the number of threats that schools received in a five-month span in 2014 compared with the same period the previous year. About 37 percent of the threats were sent electronically, and nearly a third resulted in schools being evacuated. Nearly 10 percent of the threats closed school for at least one day.

"It's a trend that started back in '08 when the recession hit," said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, the School Superintendents Association. "School districts' budgets were cut back severely. As an alternative to cutting a lot of programs, districts went the route of charging fees for sports events, uniforms, after-school activities — and eventually transportation."

For years, school districts in a number of states have been charging parents for transportation as a convenience if they live within a certain distance from school, often 2 miles or less. Those who live farther away traditionally have gotten free bus service.

SAN FRANCISCO — A student government election at a mostly Hispanic San Francisco middle school turned into a debate about the democratic process when the principal delayed the results because the winners did not reflect the school's diverse student body.

"We didn't see the increase in consumption immediately," Cohen said. "Schools shouldn't abandon healthy foods if students don't instantly" take to it, she added.

After observing 337 kids at a dozen schools in Houston, researchers found that the typical lunch brought from home contained far fewer vegetables, fruit, meat (or meat alternatives) and whole grains than federal nutrition standards advise. They also included too much salt, soda and dessert, according to a report published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.

The gaps between the food served at school and the food brought from home were not small:

With so little meat and potatoes (and fruit, vegetables and grains), what was in the home lunches? The elementary school lunches included 4.43 ounces of sugary drinks, 0.58 of a serving of snack chips and 0.67 of a serving of dessert — none of which may be served in cafeterias that follow the National School Lunch Program guidelines. Lunches brought by middle schoolers had a little more chips but a little less dessert and sugary drinks, on average.

"What we're asking for is flexibility so we can go back to making some of those decisions at a local level," said Ronda McCullick, director of food service operations for Park Hill School District in Kansas City.

McCullick and Kramer belong to the School Nutrition Association, a professional organization that represents school cafeteria workers as well as companies that supply food and equipment to districts. A thousand of the group's members converged on Capitol Hill this week to lobby lawmakers to change the school lunch standards.

It is the latest salvo in a food fight raging in Washington over the fate of the 2010 law that mandated the new standards. That law — the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act — is about to expire and must be renewed.

CHICAGO — Last school year, 11-year-old Ronan Schuelke wasn't sure what to do when another boy in his class shoved him and called him names in the lunchroom.

This year, Ronan has been chosen by his peers at Stratford Middle School in Bloomingdale, Illinois, to star in a music video designed to teach respect through a catchy parody of a Katy Perry song.

"I think this (concept) is something the kids will pick up … and maybe try it," Ronan said.

As students settle back into school hallways where peer pressure lurks and insults await, the new approach at Stratford underscores an ongoing shift in how educators deal with bullying.

PIKEVILLE, Ky. — When it opened in 1990 amid boom times deep in eastern Kentucky coal country, Shelby Valley High School had nearly 1,000 students, with enough demand that it built an addition the next year. Now the mines are closing, and the school big enough for 1,200 students sits at half capacity.

It's bad next door in the southern coalfields of West Virginia, too. The state has lost 26 percent of its public school student population since 1979 with declines in 42 of the state's 55 counties. Since 2001, that decline has slowed to less than 1 percent, a figure that would be much higher if not for the explosive growth in the Washington, D.C., bedroom communities.

With a $45,000 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and volunteer assistance from structural engineers, the project is evaluating the seismic safety of 15 schools in three districts. But the bigger goal is to develop a standard process that could be applied to schools across the state, said John Schelling, of Washington's Emergency Management Division.

ATLANTA — As the school year neared a close last April, officials in Georgia issued an urgent plea to add 30 minutes of exercise into the school day.

In a joint letter — sent to superintendents across the state — State Superintendent John Barge and Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Brenda Fitzgerald made their case for more exercise by pointing to the staggering results of a statewide fitness assessment: Only 16 percent of the state's students passed five tests of physical fitness, which measured flexibility, body/mass index, aerobic capacity (in a one-mile run/walk or in an interval run) and the ability to do push-ups and curl-ups.

One in five students was unable to pass any of the tests conducted last year.

With the state mired in a child [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity) epidemic, and kids not only heavy, but also weak, the message was simple: Find a way to get kids moving more.

WASHINGTON — Students, parents and teachers have long lamented the hours that kids spend taking standardized tests, especially since the introduction of the Common Core academic standards. But just how much time each year is it?

The correct answer is "B," according to a comprehensive study of 66 of the nation's big-city school districts by the Council of the Great City Schools. It said testing amounts to about 2.3 percent of classroom time for the average eighth-grader in public school. Between pre-K and 12th grade, students took about 112 mandatory standardized exams.

For example, Casserly said that researchers found some states and school districts were mandating not only end-of-year tests, but end-of-course tests in the same subjects, in the same grade.

In producing "The Martian," filmmakers were treated not to displays of weapons systems but a behind-the-scenes tour of Johnson Space Center. They got interviews with real NASA scientists and astronauts who answered hundreds of questions about the way ion engines and artificial gravity really work. Against the backdrop of the military-entertainment complex, all this makes the prospect of a deeper relationship between NASA and the film industry seem relatively non-threatening.

SEATTLE — There's little lyrical language to be found in the most recent international report on climate change. The document from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) runs to 2,200 pages and is crammed with technical details about greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels and atmospheric circulation.

Seattle oceanographer Gregory Johnson was a lead author of the chapter on marine measurements, and even he was having a hard time wrapping his head around the massive compilation. So when a bad cold kept him in the house one weekend, Johnson decided to distill the report to its essence via a centuries-old Japanese art form: haiku.

melt worldwide, speed increasing  

children will live in a world  

Cheng considered, delighted at the proposal.

But beginning last Friday, the S.C. Johnson research tower opened to the public for the first time. The prospect of seeing one of the few surviving Wright-designed corporate offices from inside has prompted intense interest with most of the free tours already reserved throughout May and into June. Two-hour tours of the administration building and research tower will be offered from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

GLASGOW, Scotland — Across Scotland, dinner table talk is getting heated as families argue over how to vote in Scotland's independence referendum. A generation gap has opened up, with younger voters more inclined to back independence and their elders tending to say they want to remain in the United Kingdom.

Salmond conceded defeat, saying "we know it is a majority for the No campaign" and called on Scots to accept the results of the vote.

These dark moments _ finding the old book, her father's fear, her brother's death _ hardened inside her as a young woman. She began work on a project on the Scottsboro Boys. A museum, a monument to their suffering. People in town expressed outrage. "They said I was disgracing the good name of Scottsboro," she said.

WASHINGTON  — The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the nationwide tax subsidies underpinning President Barack Obama's health care overhaul, rejecting a major challenge to the landmark law in a ruling that preserves health insurance for millions of Americans.

Obama greeted news of the decision by declaring the health care law "is here to stay." He said the law is no longer about politics, but the benefits millions of people are receiving.

In the challengers' view, the phrase "established by the state" demonstrated that subsidies were to be available only to people in states that set up their own exchanges.

In its defense, the company said it had a standard "look policy" for its sales staff that did not include wearing a headscarf. It also said Elauf had never informed it of her religion nor of her need for accommodation based on her faith.

At issue is the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which Obama said in late 2014 would allow people who have been in the United States more than five years and who have children who are in the country legally to "come out of the shadows and get right with the law."

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court struck down a disputed law Monday that would have allowed Americans born in Jerusalem to list their birthplace as Israel on their U.S. passports in an important ruling that underscores the president's authority in foreign affairs.

The court's consideration of the case has coincided with acute Palestinian-Israeli tension over Jerusalem and strain in Israeli-American relations highlighted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's criticism of the U.S. role in international negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program. For his part, President Barack Obama has said he remains unconvinced by Netanyahu's efforts to clarify statements the prime minister made during his campaign for re-election that rejected creation of a Palestinian state.

The U.N. agency, known by its initials ISA, presides over seabed outside the exclusive territorial waters of individual countries. So far, it has issued 27 exploration contracts, the large majority of them since 2011. The 15-year contracts allow for mineral prospecting on more than 390,000 square miles of seabed in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

So far, most of ISA's contracts have been issued for the deep abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, a sprawling area of the Pacific Ocean off Mexico and the U.S. At depths of 13,000 to nearly 20,000 feet, it is known to be rich in nodules containing copper, cobalt, manganese and significant concentrations of rare-earth elements. As part of an environmental plan, ISA has set aside nine areas in this zone, prohibiting them to contractors.

Other coveted exploration areas contain copper-rich sulfides formed around hydrothermal vents and black cobalt crusts created along the slopes of seamounts and volcanic mountain ranges. These biologically complex areas are found in the Western Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. ISA literature estimates that one site could provide up to 25 percent of the annual global market for cobalt.

SANTA ANA, Calif. — Once a year in June, sea lion mothers on the Channel Islands give birth to a pup. For the next 11 months, the mothers swim off to forage for days to provide food for themselves and milk for their progeny.

But in early 2015, calorie-dense sardines and anchovies — the best food — were hard to find. The mothers were forced to dive deeper and swim farther, and by the time they returned to the islands, they didn't have much milk to offer.

Marine mammal care centers are preparing for a rash of strandings. They do so even as some marine biologists and ocean advocates warn that such a compassion-laden response is little more than a futile attempt to wrap a Band-Aid on an oceanwide problem that could last decades and may have been worsened by overfishing.

It's what El Nino does to sea lions' food supply — specifically the nutritious sardines and anchovies they prefer — that makes them suffer.

It's long been known that a tiny toxin called domoic acid, produced by marine algae known as pseudo-nitzschia, kills brain cells. But new research by a University of California, Santa Cruz team illuminates the relationship between damage to the brain and sea lions' profound loss of memory and navigational skills. In recent years, biologists have increasingly observed a high number of California sea lions struggle onto beaches, weak, confused and trembling.

The sea lions were delivered to a psychology lab at UCSC, where their healing continued and they underwent behavioral tests.

The study "has very profound implications for an animal that to survive has to forage," said Lefebvre, who was not involved in the work. And it could eventually help in the diagnosis of humans poisoned by domoic acid, she said. Human cases are rare but may rise if warming ocean temperatures continue to support toxic algal blooms.

More than 3,400 sea lions were brought into the state's rehabilitation facilities between January and June — and the final tally, still being calculated, will likely surpass 4,000 animals, said Justin Viezbicke, the California stranding coordinator for NOAA fisheries. Additional animals likely died out at sea.

Nostalgic fans began a bizarre pilgrimage more than a week before the Gum Wall's demise. Kymberly Dempsey of nearby Snohomish, Wash., yanked her four children out of school early last Friday so they wouldn't miss this critical moment in the life and times of Puget Sound.

Carrabba owns Ghost Alley Espresso, a hole-in-the-wall coffee joint overlooking what — until recently — was around 1,000 square feet of fossilized gum that clung to both walls of Post Alley. Her parents are artists who sell their wares at Pike Place Market, and she has been a regular since she was 7 years old.

SEATTLE — More school districts around the U.S. are heeding the advice of scientists who have long said that expecting teens to show up to class before 8 a.m. isn't good for their health or their report cards.

After Brancheau's death, trainers stopped going in the water during the shows, but they continue to swim with the killer whales while training them.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. — Battered by controversy over its treatment of killer whales, SeaWorld San Diego announced Friday that it plans to double the size of its orca environment, contribute an additional $10 million to research on the species, and establish an independent advisory committee of scientists to oversee its orca program.

"Blackfish," a documentary, condemned SeaWorld's treatment of orcas.

"Our guests will be able to walk alongside the whales as if they were at the shore, watch them interact at the depths found in the ocean, or a birds-eye view from above," Atchison added.

There will be no "Free Willy" happy ending for the killer whales at SeaWorld San Diego.

Since the 2013 release of a documentary that accuses the company of neglecting and abusing its orcas, animal welfare activists have demanded that the San Diego theme park free its 11 killer whales.

But marine biologists — including SeaWorld critics — agree that the whales probably will never be released to the open seas.

Even if the whales don't spend the rest of their lives in the theme park, performing for capacity crowds, the closest they would get to freedom would be retirement in ocean coves separated from open water by netting. There, they would be fed and cared for by humans for the rest of their lives.

The most often cited example of a captive orca released to a sea pen is Keiko, the whale featured in the 1993 Warner Bros. movie "Free Willy."

Keiko was captured off Iceland in 1979 and trained to perform at theme parks. After several years at a theme park in Mexico City, the whale was transported to a sea pen in Iceland in 1998. Experts disagree on whether the move was a success.

Mark Simmons, a former SeaWorld trainer who was hired to assist with Keiko in Iceland, said the Keiko experience showed that sea pens are not a safe environment for killer whales.

WASHINGTON — Hurricane and Jordan, a pair of Secret Service dogs who were injured as they helped take down a White House fence jumper, got the all-clear to return to duty Thursday and quickly became stars for the beleaguered agency.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest hailed the duo at a daily press briefing Thursday and the Secret Service tweeted out their service pictures and mini-bios: "Jordan — black/tan Belgian Malinois, brown eyes, age 5, enjoys walks around (the) White House."

Jordan and Hurricane, age 6, were taken to a veterinarian Wednesday and treated for "minor bruising," Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said. They were later released and "cleared to return to duty by the veterinarian," Leary said.

As for Hurricane and Jordan, Earnest made it plain they are working animals and unlikely to mix with the first family, nor perhaps with Bo and Sunny, the Portuguese water dogs who often greet visitors to the mansion.

"The animals that performed so bravely last night are not something that we come into regular contact with here," Earnest said. "I think that there's probably a good reason why these animals are kept at some remove from employees and others who frequent the grounds of the White House. I think the individual last night probably saw pretty vividly why we all keep our distance."

The Secret Service uses Belgian Malinois, a short-haired breed that packs considerable speed and energy into its small frame. The service began its canine program in 1975 because it was found to be the most effective way of detecting explosives, it says on its website.

Tucked in a mountain on a remote Arctic island, beneath several hundred feet of rock and a near-constant blanket of snow, two imposing steel doors lock out the wind and bitter cold. Behind them, a long tunnel leads to a series of quiet, concrete rooms. Austere fluorescent bulbs illuminate thousands of black boxes crowded upon row after row of shelves, each box packed to the brim with dozens of heat-sealed silver packets.

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault opened in 2008 as a "backstop" for seed banks around the world, whose own archives of their agricultural heritage might be threatened by disaster. Isolated by miles of sea and acres of forbidding ice from the specter of earthquakes, heat waves and human menace, the vault and its contents will last 1,000 years. It's a sort of Noah's Ark for plants, built to withstand the storms (war, crop-disease, climate change, asteroid impact) that might wipe a species from the rest of the planet.

Mike Robinson, GM's vice president of sustainability and global regulatory affairs, told the U.S. House's Highways and Transit Subcommittee that for the "foreseeable future" drivers will "still need to be engaged and in control."

"For the most part, people assume than an autonomous vehicle will take you to your destination without any personal involvement," said Robinson. "These types of driverless systems are a significant distance into the future."

As the subcommittee noted in a report, function-specific automation — including automatic brakes and parallel parking — is already available in some cases. Integration of those technologies with throttle and steering control "will begin to reduce the need to driver control of the vehicle."

Ultimately, autonomous vehicles will navigate the road without human input, using electronic sensors and optical cameras to react to well-defined lane and curb markers. Officials said vehicles could move more smoothly and maintain a constant distance between vehicles, potentially resulting in a traffic system that is less congested and safer. It could also reduce fuel costs.

"This is technology that is going to be liberating," said Robinson.

Earlier this year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued plans for research on autonomous vehicles, including proposals to look into connected-vehicle technology that would allow self-driving cars to communicate via wireless radio signals, transmitting information on speed, lane departure and other data.

Several of the officials said one issue to getting self-driving vehicles on the road will be "social acceptance." Will customers be willing to buy expensive automobiles that don't require as much interaction with a driver?

Robinson said some autonomous technology, such as helping a vehicle maintain lane control, could be "brought to market before the decade ends." Congress should continue to let automakers develop new features to compete for customers, he said, and should work to block any move to create state-by-state "patchwork" requirements for vehicles.

Asked about how much autonomous vehicles could cost consumers, Robinson said that's not GM's concern at this point.

A glimpse of the coming revolution can be seen in the models debuting this week at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Hidden under their hoods and dashboards are sensors that take the first steps toward autonomous driving. Already, cars can park themselves, slam on the brakes to avoid crashes and adjust steering to stay centered in a lane.

But the disruption will go well beyond who is — or isn't — at the controls. For a century, cars have been symbols of freedom and status. Passengers of the future may well view vehicles as just another form of public transportation, to be purchased by the trip or in a subscription.

Automakers, too, will find themselves fending off digital disruption. Google is already building a fleet of experimental self-driving cars.

Schwartz believes that California may dedicate lanes to autonomous vehicles within 10 years.

This transformation will change how designers style and equip cars, said Harald Belker, a former Mercedes-Benz designer who now creates vehicles for science fiction movies — including "Minority Report," "Total Recall" and "Oblivion" — and Anki, a high-tech toy car company.

Gasoline may give way to hydrogen, batteries or both — or some as-yet-unimagined power source.

WASHINGTON — The elections for control of the Senate could hinge as much on where some candidates live as on how they vote.

Residency controversies are dogging Senate candidates in several pivotal states: Alaska, Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana and New Hampshire. Some list Washington, not the states that elect them, as their home addresses. Others moved into their states only recently, prompting criticism that they're just using the states as a way to get to the District of Columbia.

Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu is in a close re-election fight and facing criticism for maintaining a posh Capitol Hill home with her husband, listing that address on her statement of candidacy filed Aug. 11 with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

In his statement of candidacy with the FEC on May 9, Republican Senator Thad Cochran listed his address as 218-A Maryland Ave. on Capitol Hill in Washington. In February, in a new filing, he listed his address as Oxford, Mississippi, where he owns a home.

Republican primary challenger Chris McDaniel based his campaign on Cochran being too intimate with Washington. Elect me, McDaniel would say, and I'll return to the state frequently. Cochran won a runoff, however.

ORLANDO, Fla.—Public confusion, legal loopholes and shady Internet businesses have led to an "epidemic" of fake service-dog certificates, vests and harnesses for use on ordinary pets. And advocates for the disabled say the issue is creating big headaches for those who truly need the canines' assistance.

The problem has gotten so bad that Canine Companions for Independence — the nation's largest breeding and training service-dog program — launched an online petition last week asking the U.S. Department of Justice to take action.

"Unfortunately, people are trading on the fact these harnesses and vests have become distinguishing marks of service dogs, so now you find unscrupulous businesses who sell these things to people who want to take their dogs into the store or restaurant or in the passenger cabin of the plane," said Paul Mundell, national director of canine programs for CCI. "It happens all the time."

"There's no penalty for people in Florida who fraudulently claim their dog is a service animal," said Paul Edwards of Miami, president of the Florida Council of the Blind. "There are some of us who feel it isn't unreasonable to ask folks to carry identification for dogs that shows them to be a trained service animal — and most legitimate service-dog organizations do issue those. The danger is that you may throw the baby out with the bathwater."

Some advocates, for instance, are concerned that doing so may put an unreasonable burden on those with disabilities to "prove" their dog is legitimate. But others say that, because of the fraud, humans are already facing more hassles.

"It has become an epidemic," said Kris Baker, 63, who lives in Orlando. "And what we're getting is the aftermath. Somebody will take Fluffy with them into a restaurant, and the dog will bark or snap at someone or poop on the floor. So when we come in with a legitimate dog, we get the questions and the resentment. It's harder for us."

Baker, who had polio as a child and has used a wheelchair for 30 years, needs her CCI dog to help pull her along when she gets fatigued. The dog also opens and shuts doors, retrieves the phone, picks up objects she drops and helps open the refrigerator and cabinets. So when people ask her in ignorance, "Hey, where can I get one of those vests for my dog?" she educates them.

A search of eBay under "service dog patches," for instance, reveals more than 22,000 sellers. While some can certainly be used for legitimate purposes, advocates for the disabled say many are not.

CCI.org is seeking to get 10,000 signers in the next week to say the problem needs to be stopped. "That's the exact purpose of our petition," said Martha Johnson, a CCI spokeswoman for the Southeast region. "We want to go to the Department of Justice and say: 'Look at how many people agree this is a problem, and something needs to be done.'"
Then came Sweet Baby Jo, part of a project called PHARM Dog, for Pets Helping Agriculture in Rural Missouri, which may be the only program like it in the country. Plenty of others train service dogs, but this program is specifically for farmers who don't want to give up farm life because of disability or sickness.

Meet Julia. As you might have heard, she's Sesame Street's newest Muppet. She has bright orange hair, big green eyes, and sometimes takes a long time to answer questions. She's autistic.

Which might seem odd: Autism spectrum disorders affect 1 in 68 American children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But 1 in 42 boys are diagnosed with autism, compared with 1 in 189 girls — meaning about five times as many boys as girls are diagnosed with autism.

So if Sesame, whose mission is "to help all children grow smarter, stronger and kinder," were truly interested in representing autism most accurately, wouldn't its new character be a boy?

Children with autism vary in their traits significantly: some can talk, while others can't. Many of them are sensitive to noise. Some have trouble keeping eye contact, and many of them experience the world differently, so they'll touch different objects to explore the sensation of texture. Perhaps because of this range, autism is also extremely controversial. While some organizations, such as Autism Speaks, consider autism a syndrome that calls for research to help mitigate its effects, others, such as the Autism Self-Advocacy Network, simply view autism as an alternative way of expressing oneself.

The storybook doesn't explain autism explicitly but rather shows Julia playing with Elmo. It mentions things like how when she plays with a toy bus, "she especially likes spinning the wheels around and around."

Sesame also shows Julia's autism in how she communicates with other Muppets. In one scene, as she swings with Elmo, Elmo introduces her to his friend Abby. But Julia keeps swinging and doesn't look in Abby's direction, prompting Abby to say, "Your friend doesn't like me."

But that's not true, Elmo responds. "It's just hard for her to talk when she's swinging," he explains. Once Julia finishes swinging, Abby tries again, and asks if they can play together, but Julia just looks down.

Again, Elmo has the answers. "Elmo's daddy told Elmo that Julia has autism," he says. "So she does things a little differently. Sometimes Elmo talks to Julia using fewer words and says the same things a few times."

NEW YORK — Most Americans born since the mid-1960s have a favorite "Sesame Street" skit. Jennifer Kotler Clarke watched hers on a black-and-white television set in her family's Bronx apartment. There were two aliens: One of them had long arms that didn't move, while the other had short, moving arms. The aliens wished to eat apples from a tree, and they succeeded, after a couple of minutes, by working together. "Let's call this cooperation," one of them says. "No," the other replies, "let's call it Shirley."

"Double Falsehood," a play said to have been written by William Shakespeare but whose authorship has been disputed for close to three centuries, is almost certainly the work of the 16th-century poet and playwright, new research finds.

Shakespeare appears to have had some assistance in the project from John Fletcher, a contemporary who is thought to have co-written three plays with the Bard — including one on a theme similar to that of "Double Falsehood" — near the end of Shakespeare's life.

Nevertheless, "the entire play was consistently linked to Shakespeare with a high probability," the authors of the new study wrote.

For Shakespeare, much of whose life remains a mystery, the analysis offers a bit of insight: his frequent use of prepositions suggests he was rigorously educated in grammar. His heavy use of "social content words" (vs. words related to thought processes or emotion) suggests he was more attuned to social niceties and advancement than he was either cerebral or preoccupied by his own or others' feelings, the authors wrote.
TV's celebration recently of everything sharky came during a summer with a record-high number of shark bites to swimmers in North Carolina. But that doesn't mean the risk of getting bitten by a shark is getting worse in North Carolina or anywhere else in the world. In fact, a new study suggests that the risk might be dropping globally, just as it is for white shark bites off the California coast.

The risk of any shark bite is already incredibly low — far less likely than drowning or many other rare risks, he said. But, "the more people you have going into the water, the better the odds are that something bad is going to happen," he said, "whether it's a shark bite or getting pulled under on a riptide."

Much research has documented the decline of shark populations across the world, though it's unclear whether that's the case for white sharks in California. But the number of scuba divers, surfers and beachgoers has exploded in California over the past six decades.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — After a difficult nighttime battle from a Broward County beach, Viktor Hluben hauled a 14-foot great hammerhead shark into the surf.

His friends looped a line around the shark's tail and dragged it ashore. As the shark lay motionless, its snout in the water, five of them posed for photos and video. Moving quickly, they cut the fishing line and hauled the shark into waist-deep water, its mouth streaked with blood.

The shark swam off, and over the next few weeks a YouTube video of the event notched more than 1 million hits, with Hluben and his friends receiving international newspaper and broadcast coverage.

Such videos have become increasingly popular, as land-based anglers in South Florida catch great hammerheads, tiger sharks and other formidable predators. But questions have arisen over whether these activities are legal and whether they leave the shark with much chance of survival.

Capt. Rama Shuster, of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission's Division of Law Enforcement, acknowledged it is not legal to land a species for which only catch-and-release fishing is allowed. He said state wildlife officers are cautious about second-guessing the actions of anglers at the moment of releasing a shark, however, since human safety is involved. But he said, "There's never a time when it's OK to drag it up on the beach and pose for pictures."

It's a mystery of the sea: How many great white sharks are prowling near California's surf lines?

Some scientists say the population is large and healthy. Others say it is alarmingly small. No one has ever known for certain, but the question has become crucial this year.

"This is a tough one — we are keenly aware that the scientific community is polarized on this issue," said Adrianna Shea, deputy chief of the California Department of Fish and Game Commission.

"We know that South Florida is the terminus of this annual migration," he said. "As global temperatures continue to rise, their preferred temperature may be found not here but farther north. Maybe a decade or two down the road, we're not going to have these tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of top predators cleaning out the reefs. What's going to happen then?"

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. — "Yeehaw!" the sport fishermen yelled when they saw the fins slice the gray channel water off Huntington Beach.

The chum of chopped mackerel and sardines had worked. The fight was on — and so were the cameras.

The six men had motored out in the June gloom Monday morning for more than a day of fun. They were filming a reality show called "The Professionals" for the Outdoor Channel.

The way they tell it, they hooked a giant mako and Jason Johnston, from Mesquite, Texas, got in the pole harness to reel it in. He grunted and slipped and slid for 2 1/2 hours as the shark ran the line out almost a mile, thrashing and jumping 20 feet in the air. They finally pulled it to the side of the boat, the Breakaway, and tied it up with a steel cable.

By the time they hauled it to Huntington Harbour and had it weighed at a processing plant in Gardena, south of Los Angeles, they realized they appeared to have broken a record for the largest mako to be caught by line, 1,323.5 pounds.

One of earth's most ancient and mythologized creatures still manages to stir humans' imaginations, scratching that atavistic urge to bring in a monster. But even before it became clear that the catch was for a reality show, plenty of people wondered why they really had to kill such a magnificent animal.

Ben Ahadpour, who owns the marina the fisherman left from, said the captain of the boat, Matt Potter, 33, of Huntington Beach, knew the dock rules prohibited bringing in sharks.

"He shouldn't have done that," Ahadpour said. "They could have done a catch and release. They can bring it up close, take a picture and let the shark go. But I guess they're so excited about their catch and getting his two minutes of fame."

David McGuire, the director of Shark Stewards, a San Francisco Bay Area nonprofit that advocates for the protection of sharks, said he was shocked.

He lamented that so many shows about sharks continue to evoke Jaws-like terror rather than science. "These kind of reality shows are not reality. The reality is we're overfishing sharks, and this macho big-game attitude should be a relic of the past."

Keith Poe, a sport fisherman who tags and releases sharks for conservationists, said that most anglers are releasing sharks these days, but might keep a potential record breaker.

"I wouldn't keep it, but the general sportfishing community would say it's acceptable."

Potter, whose nickname is "Mako Matt," doesn't buy any of the criticism, adding that he unloaded the shark at a public dock — not the marina. "It's just like any other fishing. The state limit for mako is two per person per day."

Across the street from Gian's shop, Wing Hop Fung Ginseng & China Products was down to its last three bins of dried shark fins, including one marked by an eye-catching sign: "Father's Day Special! 20 percent off. $999 a pound."

As for Gian, she still had a lot of fins to move.

"Maybe we'll reduce the prices even more, or eat them ourselves, or maybe move them to a state where they are still legal," she said.
It was an 8-foot tiger shark, one of the most aggressive shark species in Hawaii's waters and the likely culprit for many of the 14 attacks in 2013, eight of which occurred around Maui, near Makena's beaches and elsewhere. Releasing his net, the fisherman took off running down the shoreline, shouting for swimmers to get out of the water.

"By then everyone was kind of running," Dececco said in an interview moments after he and his daughter had scrambled up the rocky cliff above the cove for a better view. "Tiger sharks — you don't play with them."

"I went in waist-deep, that was it," said Karen O'Brien, a 49-year-old tourist from Toronto. Last year, O'Brien snorkeled off Molokini, a small island off the southwest coast of Maui. But after reading that the kayak fisherman was attacked near Molokini, she said, "I wasn't interested."

Unlike their great white cousins, leopard sharks don't eat people. "They have very tiny teeth. It's like sandpaper," Hobbs said. "At most, they might give you a scrape."

Similarly, the scientists aren't killing leopard sharks. The worst they do is make them vomit.

Scientists could catch the sharks and cut them open to study what the sharks eat when they swim into the former salt ponds. But to avoid that fate, instead they catch them in nets and with barbless hooks. They take pump sprayers, similar to what backyard gardeners use to spray weed killer on dandelions, and place the nozzles in the sharks' mouths to spray water into their stomachs. That makes them throw up.

The researchers and their students catch the contents in a bucket — think lots of chewed up little fish and worms — and return the sharks to the water.

"It doesn't hurt them," Hobbs said. "We throw them back within two or three minutes, they swim away, and they start eating again."

The UC Davis researchers preserve the regurgitated shark food in ethanol to carefully catalog the sharks' diets.

No two leopard sharks have the same spots. They aren't [endangered](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), Slager said, but face threats, from fishing to mercury pollution. They never get the attention great whites get. "If Steven Spielberg would do a movie about leopard sharks that would be wonderful," Slager said. "They are delightful. They have beautiful patterns. And they are a pleasure to work with."
Family members of the dead Sherpas said they are angry at the government and worried about their future.

Because of their additional work, many have to pass through the Khumbu Icefall dozens of times, each time exposing themselves to the treacherous conditions there.

ROME — The Costa Concordia is set to be removed from the shoreline of the Italian island of Giglio by mid-2014, experts said Tuesday, after the wrecked cruise liner was successfully pried from the rocks it had been wedged against for the last 20 months.

The operation to straighten the 300-meter, 114,000-ton vessel by 65 degrees took 19 hours. Engineers had hoped it could be done in 10 to 12 hours, but always insisted that getting it right was more important that doing it fast.

"I am relieved and I am a bit tired. I will have a beer and go to sleep. I am sending a kiss to my wife," the South African-born chief salvage master, Nick Sloane, said as he emerged from the barge from which he commanded the operation.

The listing hull was lifted using steel cables and tanks attached to its exposed side, which were filled with water and used as counterweights in the effort to pull up the wreck, which was rested on a false seabed.

Engineers were next planning to inspect the side that emerged from the waters, which was covered in brown mud and was heavily deformed. The idea is to attach tanks also on that side, and use them to refloat the ship by emptying them of water and filling them with air.

The Concordia's rotation was a major engineering feat. The risk was that the rusting hull could snap or sink entirely, jeopardizing the entire salvage operation and causing a likely environmental disaster.

"It could not have gone any better," Porcellacchia said, while Italian Civil Protection agency chief Franco Gabrielli attacked doomsayers. He singled out a member of the Italian chapter of Greenpeace, who had predicted the spillage of vast quantities of sewage.

Instead, there was no release of toxic liquids. The Concordia was emptied of fuel two months after its shipwreck, but seawater inside its hull is thought to have been contaminated by residual fuel, chemicals and rotting food on board.

As the straightening was completed, salvage team members hugged and applause broke out in the press briefing room, while sirens in the port of Giglio, the tiny Italian island where the Concordia ran aground, blared in celebration.

The disgraced captain is accused of having taken the ship dangerously close to the shore to perform a stunt, and to have badly mishandled emergency procedures on the night of the disaster. He left the Concordia before all passengers had been evacuated.

Much attention has been paid to the issue over the years — Oprah Winfrey complained that a Swiss clerk did not think she could afford a $38,000 handbag, and even President Barack Obama has said he was once followed in stores. But according to shoppers interviewed Monday, many people don't recognize how prevalent retail discrimination is, and how the consistent stream of small insults adds up to a large problem.

Those skewed views can affect who gets arrested for retail theft, said Jerome Williams, a business professor at Rutgers University who has studied marketplace discrimination.

On Thursday, the snowpack was a paltry 25 percent of average for this time of year. A parched January is partly to blame. But the snowpack is also skimpy because warm storms that hit the state in December dumped copious amounts of rain, not snow.

The loss of snowpack is "definitely going to be a problem," said Jay Lund, director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at University of California, Davis. "But if it's managed well, it should not be a catastrophe."
After weeks of gridlock, the measure had support from the White House, most if not all Democrats in Congress and many Republicans fearful of the economic impact of a default. As a result, there was little or no doubt it would pass both houses and reach the White House in time for Obama's signature before the administration's Oct. 17 deadline.

WASHINGTON — A broad swath of the public might not even notice the partial shutdown of the federal government Tuesday, but many federal employees, government contractors and users of government services are likely to feel the pain.

Unable to reach an agreement last night as the House and Senate played political tennis over a plan to temporarily fund the budget, the nation will wake up to an altered government landscape. Some of the services immediately affected are largely invisible, but important, nonetheless.

— The Medicare program will continue uninterrupted, but if the shutdown lasts more than a month, reimbursements to doctors and hospitals could be delayed. A shutdown also will not affect the Tuesday launch of the new federally run insurance marketplaces in 30-plus states as part of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.

The iconic Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor is part of the National Park System's 401 national parks that will also close, including Philadelphia's Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, and Yellowstone National Park, where guests in hotels and campgrounds will have 48 hours to leave.

YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. — Clare Cogan and Daniel Mohally stood forlornly inside the Yosemite Visitors Bureau, trying to determine how to salvage their honeymoon.

The Cork, Ireland, couple had flown to the United States last week for a honeymoon that started in San Diego and will end in San Francisco. In between — the highlight of their trip — was an excursion to Yosemite.

On Wednesday, Yosemite National Park was nearly empty, an emblem of the bitter, partisan battle in Washington that has shut down parts of the federal government for the first time in 17 years, including all 401 National Park Service sites.

Early October is a far cry from the crush of visitors during the height of summer, but still a bustling time in Yosemite.

"It's when everybody who doesn't come in the summer comes," chuckled Tollefson, now president of the nonprofit Yosemite Conservancy. As many as 20,000 people a day would normally be in the park, many of them foreigners who time their trips long in advance and specifically for the late season.

"They don't understand it," said Jan Quistad, a retired principal who works at the front desk of the visitors bureau in Oakhurst, about a 30-minute drive from the park. In a typical week, the bureau will receive 60 visitors. This week, it was overrun by 200 a day — many of them foreign visitors who didn't know where else to turn.

Gediman said he had just met a couple from Israel who had planned a 14-day trip — first Yosemite, followed by Death Valley, Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park.

Yosemite's tourism economy is responsible for 5,000 jobs, and there were already indications that an extended shutdown could represent a cascade of trouble. In Oakhurst, the Best Western Plus Yosemite Gateway Inn's 133 rooms were scheduled at near-capacity, said manager Bill Putnam. Then came the shutdown — and 25 cancellations by Wednesday afternoon.

"We've had 67 strandings of sea lions of all different ages," said Johnson, whose center would normally see one, maybe two, sea lions in the entire month of January. "The whole population is getting hit hard."

He added, "It's a real shock to us."

It's the Friday night of a long weekend and summer is almost here. A brand-new meteor shower is supposed to peak tonight, and in just a few minutes these teens will release a high-altitude balloon to the edge of space, hoping to photograph a shooting star.

As the first stars emerge, the students secure the payload — a soft, insulated lunchbox — to the bottom of the balloon. Inside is a low-light camera to record the meteors, an altimeter to measure altitude and a thermometer to gauge the changes along an ascent that could take the balloon as high as 22 miles above ground. Two GPS trackers are mounted on the outside of the payload to help them find it later.

Over the last four years, this tight-knit group has launched 53 balloons into the stratosphere. It's a long-running science project with a twist: part astronomy experiment, part backcountry adventure.

"Five, four, three, two, one," they chant, and the balloon begins to rise. Reid follows it with a powerful flashlight for a few moments, illuminating the creamy orb in the moonless sky.

There is quiet, and a palpable feeling of collective wonder. Then the balloon disappears into the night.

"For us it does not matter who they're targeting," said Kaleka, a former Milwaukee police officer and teacher whose father was one of six people killed in 2012 when a white supremacist opened fire at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. "This time we cannot differentiate ourselves; when hate rhetoric is being spewed we cannot be on the sidelines."

As a result, some Sikhs have encountered violence.

In 2013, a Green Bay, Wisconsin, man was charged with a hate crime for allegedly setting fire to a convenience store owned by a Sikh-American.

Although some single-sex colleges face uncertainties, they are not doomed, according to David L. Warren, president of the National Association of Independent College and Universities.

"There is no doubt there has been a winnowing in the number of these institutions nationally. But good leadership by boards and college leaders, and a continued commitment to single-sex education combined with smart business plans and innovative curriculum will enable many of the current institutions to thrive in the years to come," he said.

The survival of women's colleges is important to help produce the next generation of female leaders, especially among minorities and students who are the first in their families to attend college, said Michele Ozumba, president of the Women's College Coalition. While such schools don't appeal to a large swath of high school seniors, enough young women would consider single-gender colleges as "a pathway to success" if colleges work hard enough to recruit them and explain the educational advantages they can find there, she said.

ORLANDO, Fla. — First came the cracking sounds. Then windows started blowing out. And before they knew it, guests felt the ground beneath their Lake County resort near Disney World sink into the ground.

No one was injured but about three dozen resort goers left behind car keys, medication and other personal belongings inside their luxury condominiums after the crumbling edifices were evacuated.

About 20 individuals — men, women and children — left behind everything they brought to their vacation rental. The American Red Cross is on scene to assist the displaced guests.

The most famous mass extinction came from space, but the biggest might have been because of carbon dioxide. Cataclysms, whether the asteroid that ended the dinosaurs' reign or the volcanism that may have caused the Great Dying, drove the first five mass extinctions in Earth's history, in which 75 percent or more of the planet's life died out. The sixth mass extinction may now be beginning — and the apocalypse this time is us.

The biggest, fiercest animals still left on the planet — elephants, tigers, whales, among others — are most at risk. And we humans have shown no inclination to stop the activities — overexploitation for food, habitat destruction and others — that drive extinction.

The stellar search was a welcome diversion for Sandoval, whose mother, Holly Houser, died of cancer in October. In the last years of his mom's life, the physics major lived at home, juggling her care with his education, sometimes rushing her to the emergency room at night and dragging himself to class the next day from Fremont.

MALAM JABBA, Pakistan — Boys in tattered coats schuss down Malam Jabba's powdery slope on homemade pine skis. Galoshes nailed to the planks suffice as ski boots. Bamboo sticks serve as poles.

A few hundred yards away, jobless men trudge to the top of a snowy ridge to scavenge scrap metal from the mounds of rubble at what was long the country's only ski resort, a posh winter getaway that drew moneyed businessmen and European diplomats to this rugged northwestern region known as "the Switzerland of Pakistan."

That changed five years ago, when the Taliban temporarily took control of the Swat Valley. During its brutal reign in the shadow of the white-capped peaks of the Hindu Kush mountains, the Islamist militant group beheaded those it viewed as opponents, burned down schools and forbade girls to attend classes.

"It was a beautiful, huge hotel, and it was always full," Ali said. He and his family fled Swat during the military offensive and returned four months later to find the hotel destroyed. "When I saw it, my heart sank. It was so beautiful, but it also meant we had jobs."

SEOUL — It is not unusual this week to see children and adults wearing face masks here as they walk the streets and subway stations. People are taking this precaution due to an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) that began in May after a man infected with the disease returned to Seoul from the Middle East, initiating the first outbreak beyond that region.

CHARLESTON, S.C. — A grand jury affirmed the state of South Carolina's murder charge on Monday against a white former North Charleston police officer who fatally shot an unarmed black man trying to run from a traffic stop.

The United Nations on Wednesday remembered the millions of victims of the largest forced migration in history with the unveiling of a slavery memorial on its visitors plaza before global ambassadors and Jamaica Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller.

Designed by Haitian-American architect Rodney Leon, The Ark of Return memorializes the estimated 15 million African men, women and children who died during the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the millions of others forced into plantation slavery in the Americas. Leon beat out 310 architects and designers for the chance to design the permanent structure at the U.N.'s New York headquarters.

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the memorial stands as a reminder of not just the brutal crossing of the Atlantic Ocean but also recognizes "the significant contributions that slaves and their descendants have made."

UNITED NATIONS — There are no shortages of challenges facing Caribbean countries — burgeoning unemployment, high crime, a chronic health crisis.

But for almost every Caribbean leader who spoke to the United Nations General Assembly last week, one issue came up time and again: compensating descendants of enslaved and oppressed Africans in Europe's former colonies for the generational and, arguably, irreparable damage of slavery.

For decades, cultural leaders, black scholars and others across the United States, Caribbean and Africa have unsuccessfully sought reparations from Britain, France and the Netherlands for sponsoring and endorsing kidnapping, enslaving and selling Africans. But their calls have always lacked a groundswell of support from a majority of citizens, and political leaders — until now.

In recent weeks, the movement for reparations has been gaining momentum, occupying the attention of leaders of the 15-member Caribbean Community regional bloc, who have unanimously agreed to make a moral, ethical and — if necessary — legal case for the former colonial powers to pay up. They have consulted with a British law firm, called for apologies and even talked of going to the International Court of Justice should efforts to bring their former colonizers to the negotiating table fail.

Ralph Gonsalves, prime minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, who this month hosted a three-day Regional Reparations Conference, is helping to lead the movement.

It was Beckles' recently published book, "Britain's Black Debt: Reparations for Caribbean Slavery and Native Genocide," from which the conference's title was drawn. The book argues that Britain built its economic empire on slave labor, and the legacy of slavery continues to play out in the region's ongoing development challenges.

It is unclear whether other nations will join the Caribbean's call. On Monday, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and newly elected President of the General Assembly John William Ashe joined global leaders for the unveiling of the winning design of a permanent memorial at U.N. headquarters to honor victims of slavery.

French President François Hollande has continued to resist demands on his nation to pay reparations for its role in Haiti's independence and the slave trade. His refusal was consistent with that of Jacques Chirac, the president who on the eve of Haiti's Jan. 1, 2004, bicentennial, quickly rejected a demand by Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that France pay restitution to Haiti for the amount it was forced to pay for its freedom in 1804.

Meanwhile, blacks in America have had no more success than their counterparts. Attempts to have the courts force the U.S. to pay reparations or to cash in on the 40 acres and a mule promised to former slaves after the Civil War ended in 1865 have gone nowhere.

Still, Heather Russell, a professor of Caribbean and African-American literature at Florida International University, says she is "cautiously hopeful" by the Caribbean Community's latest efforts.

"You have 15 heads of government who have signed on for this proposition," said Russell, a Jamaica native. "You have to make the moral stakes really high and so you do that through raising awareness. This issue has never been squarely put on the table."

Verene Shepherd, a historian and longtime militant in the fight for reparations, said unlike 20 years ago there is today "a heightened consciousness" on the impact of slavery and a widening movement to address its legacy and ways colonizers can provide reparations beyond a dollar amount. Also, the circle of activists has grown beyond the Rastafarians in Jamaica and academics.

"Ongoing conflicts, extremes of poverty, high levels of corruption and the impact of resource exploitation to feed global markets all increase the risk of enslavement in many African countries. Child and forced marriages are still tolerated in the context of informal or 'traditional' legal systems in many countries," the report said.

Boat captains and managers, along with workers, confirmed violence and danger in the Thai seafood sector, a booming industry that exports $7 billion of products a year, although managers said workers sometimes got hurt because they were drunk and fighting. Boat captains rarely checked ages of workers, and Verite found underage workers forced to fish. Workers said they labor without rest, their food and water are minimal, outside contact is cut off, and they are given fake identities to hide that they are working illegally.

In fact, Nestle is already being sued: In August, pet food buyers filed a class-action lawsuit alleging Fancy Feast cat food was the product of slave labor associated with Thai Union Frozen Products, a major distributor. It's one of several lawsuits filed in recent months against major U.S. retailers importing seafood from Thailand.

Some of the litigation cites the reports from the AP, which tracked slave-caught fish to the supply chains of giant food sellers, such as Wal-Mart, Sysco and Kroger, and popular brands of canned pet food, such as Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. It can turn up as calamari at fine restaurants, as imitation crab in a sushi roll or as packages of frozen snapper relabeled with store brands that land on dinner tables. The U.S. companies have all said they strongly condemn labor abuse and are taking steps to prevent it.

WASHINGTON — In the final days of 1794, a Portuguese ship taking about 400 slaves from Mozambique to Brazil crashed on the rocks off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa. About half of the slaves died in the rough surf, while the survivors were resold and sent on to work on Brazil's sugar plantations.

Now an iron ballast and a wooden pulley block retrieved from the shipwreck of the São José-Paquete de Africa are coming to Washington, where next year they will be on view in an exhibition on slavery in the new National Museum of African American History and Culture.

"These will be part of the list of 'I've got to see this,'" predicted Lonnie Bunch, the museum's founding director, who was in South Africa for a formal announcement Monday of the long-term loan of the objects from the Iziko Museums.

The artifacts represent a significant addition to the 33,000-item collection of the newest Smithsonian museum, which is set to open next year on the Mall.

Created by Congress in 2003, the National Museum of African American History and Culture will open its $540 million facility with 11 exhibitions, including the one on slavery. The museum has already collected important slave-related items, including iron shackles for a child, a bill of sale for a 10-year-old slave boy, and a 19th-century slave cabin from Edisto Island, South Carolina.

The loan agreement represents a milestone for the Slave Wreck Project, a global effort launched in 2008 to study the slave trade through the discovery and archeological study of shipwrecks.

"It's a great collaboration that brings us across the ocean," Gardullo said. "We've created this new model, engaging in these conversations and looking at new ways to do this work."

The São José shipwreck was first discovered in the 1980s but was misidentified as an earlier Dutch vessel. In 2008, researchers with the Slave Wreck Project chose the site as its pilot project and began to explore the underwater location and conduct research in the archives of cities it was thought to have visited.

Since 2010, project researchers have uncovered documents in Portugal that have revealed the ship's owners, its cargo when it departed from Mozambique and evidence of the sale of a slave by a local sheikh to the ship's captain.

"Sledding is a risky activity," Dubuque's city attorney wrote in proposing the ban. "It's not unusual for people to talk about their accidents or near accidents along with the fun times they've had."

Nationwide, sledding injuries sent nearly 230,000 kids to emergency rooms between 1997 and 2007, according to the Center for Injury Research and Policy, based in Columbus, Ohio.

But for some cities, banning sledding is not so easy. Omaha prohibited sledding at a popular hill as a test after settling its lawsuit but allowed it again after residents ignored the ban. As city attorney Tom Mumgaard put it: "It wasn't practical."

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) declared the chronic sleepiness of our nation's teenagers a public health problem in a policy statement Monday. And to help fix the problem, the organization called for middle and high schools to push back their start times 30 minutes to an hour to allow students to get more rest.

With the school year just underway, students like Bankowski are already sleep-deprived. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued what it hopes will be a wake-up call to the nation's educators: Push back school start times to 8:30 a.m. or later.

Slopestyle, the newest Olympic event, was always going to be a flashy addition to the Games — an acrobatic, free-form assault on a snowy obstacle course of rails and jumps. Elements of danger wouldn't just be evident. They would be a selling point, a path that would lead "slope" from X Games curiosity to legitimacy at the highest levels of international sport.

On Wednesday, Shaun White, the most famous snowboarder in the world and one of the Games' seminal faces, abruptly withdrew from slopestyle, a day before competition would begin for the first time at the Olympic level.

Industry experts and theme park visitors say the low-tech attraction's popularity hinges on its simplicity and sunny message of peace. Plus, the indoor musical boat trip is fully air-conditioned, the lines usually move fast and it clocks in at 15 minutes.

Loaded with pictures, some of them imprudent, David Leon Riley's Samsung Instinct was searched by police in 2009 without a warrant. He got busted. Now the justices, who sometimes seem uncomfortable with new technologies, will consider a quintessentially 21st-century problem.

WASHINGTON — Flashback to a 1940s jazz club. A saxophonist performs on stage wearing his sunglasses at night. "I'm cool," he says, relaxed in the moment.

Over the past five years, curators at the National Portrait Gallery set out to examine how that idea of cool has shaped American culture. A new exhibit opening Friday gives the concept an entertaining yet scholarly treatment with 100 photographs of people who defined cool as a word for rebellion, self-expression, charisma, edge and mystery.

"American Cool" traces the idea further back to the "granddaddies of cool," Walt Whitman and Frederick Douglass, and unfolds through the generations, leading to Jay-Z, Johnny Depp and Madonna.

"These are the successful cultural rebels of American culture," said Joel Dinerstein, a professor and jazz scholar at Tulane University who co-curated the show and teaches a college course on the history of being cool.

SEATTLE — Fifty years after the U.S. Surgeon General first warned of the health effects of smoking, a new analysis from the University of Washington shows that the number of smokers worldwide — and the number of cigarettes consumed — has never been higher.

Between 1980 and 2012, the number of adults who smoke increased from 721 million to nearly 1 billion, reports the study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The number of cigarettes smoked globally jumped from about 5 trillion to 6.25 trillion.

The study, which is one of the most comprehensive ever to examine global tobacco use, shows that the remarkable reductions in smoking rates in the United States and other wealthy countries have been offset by a growing epidemic in the developing world.

"The University of Washington study demonstrated clearly how much further the world, particularly low- and middle-income countries, still has to go," said Matthew Myers, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

The rise in the number of smokers reflects both population growth — particularly in nations such as China and Indonesia — and the tobacco industry's heavy marketing in poorer nations, experts say.

Smoking statistics are usually reported in terms of rates — or the percentage of people who smoke. The UW analysis confirmed that the global smoking rate dropped from 26 percent to 18.7 percent during the study period.

Most snakebites involve native species and bad judgment, commented Bradley Lawrence, the zoo's reptile and amphibian supervisor.

"Most of the time it's native venomous snakes that somebody has decided to mess around with, late at night, probably because they've had a few too many," he said. "Like, 'Oh, look, there's a snake. Let's pick it up!'"

The most recent call for help came in January, when a man in the Dallas-Fort Worth area was bitten by his African bush viper, an exotic species without its own antivenom.

Although pollsters find many younger Americans applaud his whistleblowing, the majority express dislike for him, which probably will discourage leading candidates in the looming presidential election from expending political capital on a call for clemency. In a U.S. News &amp; World Report poll in April, 64 percent of respondents familiar with Snowden said they held a negative view of him.

"Edward loves America and he would definitely like to return home," Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden's Moscow lawyer, said in an interview at his ornate central Moscow office. "But it is our position, and a very simple one, that as long as his case is politicized and commented on as it is by politicians of all levels, that his return to his motherland is impossible."

WASHINGTON — Edward Snowden is a courageous American hero and will be remembered as one long after the "war on terror" is replaced by some other pretext for violating Americans' constitutional rights and the rest of the world's national sovereignty, privacy and, sometimes, security.

However, there is a mountain of evidence that this massive data-gathering is in fact being used against citizens who are involved in constitutionally protected activity, such as political organizing and public education.

### CON: He is a traitor in all but name

WASHINGTON — Edward Snowden stole hundreds of thousands of American secrets and sprinkled them across the Internet. Should he be considered a traitor?

The Australian government thinks so. Snowden's revelation of highly sensitive intelligence operations "down under" led Australian Federal Attorney-General George Brandis to brand the ex-NSA contractor an "American traitor."

But behind the curtain, the two democracies had worked out a practical, mutually beneficial information-sharing deal that helped them deal with sensitive issues like refugees and human trafficking. Snowden's disclosures have now jeopardized this valuable cooperative effort.

In a strictly legal sense, under U.S. law Snowden might not meet the definition of the word "traitor." But the common understanding of the term would certainly apply.

Instead, they've mostly spilled secrets from nations ranked at the top of the Freedom House "Index of Freedom in the World." These are the countries that organize the peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, combat nuclear proliferation, champion human rights, fight terrorism and human trafficking, and hold free and fair elections. Regardless of their stated intentions, Snowden's and Assange's actions have undercut the world's champions of freedom and given aid and comfort to the world's totalitarian regimes.

Further, they have betrayed the idea of freedom. The Assange/Snowden doctrine asserts that complete transparency equals freedom. That's not just naïve. It's as pornographic a description of freedom as Auschwitz's "Work Makes You Free" sign.

Respect for individual privacy is an inherent component of freedom. The government of free peoples is an extension of the people, exercising sovereignty on their behalf. Free societies recognize that keeping legitimate secrets is a legitimate function of government.



Snowden is neither "freedom fighter" nor "whistle-blower." His leaks are indiscriminate. The vast majority expose no wrongdoing whatsoever.

What about those cases where Snowden might argue he has revealed practices that might cross the line? His actions are still, at best, irresponsible.

The United States system of ordered liberty offers multiple ways to raise claims of malfeasance or abuse of power without compromising national security. Federal agencies have inspector generals. Congress routinely investigates such claims. And, yes, we have "whistle-blower" protection laws. The notion that Snowden had no option but to leak is indefensible.

Finally, Snowden betrayed the trust he was given by the U.S. government to safeguard the nation's secrets.

Free societies depend on a trustworthy citizenry. If bank tellers, lawyers, doctors, police officials and others in positions of trust were to decide they were, individually, the best arbitrators of what information should or should not be dumped in the public sphere, we wouldn't be living in Assange's paradise. We would be living in North Korea, where no one is trusted … ever.

Edward Snowden has betrayed freedom. In the end, that's a much greater offense than intentionally acting like an enemy agent.

>ABOUT THE WRITER:

Snowden's attempt to avoid facing criminal charges in the United States has become an international game of hide-and-seek, with the Obama administration getting little help from the governments of Hong Kong and Russia.

U.S. authorities want to arrest Snowden on charges of espionage and theft, and have revoked his passport.

Snowden, 29, has received help from WikiLeaks, the group that has made a reputation by leaking the secrets of governments of many countries on the Internet.  WikiLeaks' leader, Julian Assange, has been living under asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for a year, trying to avoid legal problems of his own.

## Snowden Sought Asylum In Ecuador

Much to the Obama administration's chagrin, Hong Kong let Snowden fly to Russia on Sunday. Hong Kong authorities said they had asked the United States for more information regarding the request to extradite Snowden, and could not legally stop him from leaving.

U.S. officials have expressed their displeasure with Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous Chinese territory, and with China itself. They said that they had been answering Hong Kong's questions when Snowden left.

Once he arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, things became even more interesting. There is no direct flight from Moscow to Ecuador. Reports said that Snowden was taking a flight to Cuba on Monday.

The gate where the flight was boarding was mobbed by reporters and television cameras, with some journalists going as far as to book seats on the flight. But Snowden never boarded the aircraft.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday said that Russia should turn Snowden over to the U.S. "I would urge them to live by the standards of the law because that is in the interest of everybody," he said.

But Russian officials were playing coy. "Overall, we have no information about him," Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary told Reuters.

## Who's The Spy Here?

"The U.S. government is spying on each and every one of us, but it is Edward Snowden who is charged with espionage for tipping us off," he said in a speech published over the weekend.
WASHINGTON, D.C. — As state transportation officials across the U.S. prepare for this season's onslaught of winter blizzards and ice storms, many of them will be using technology in new ways to help clear the roads and make them safer for drivers.

From Pennsylvania to Nevada, states will be battling the elements by using tools such as road sensors, tracking gear on snowplows and onboard cameras that upload photos of current conditions.

"So many people think there isn't anything you can do about the winter — it snows and you just accept it," Nelson said. "But as a country, we are so dependent on our mobility. There's a lot of pressure on states to maintain mobility 24/7, 365 days a year, regardless of what the weather throws their way."

SAN DIEGO — Brush fires broke out Wednesday in more than half a dozen spots in northern San Diego County and spread at a dangerous pace as hot, dry, erratic winds, backed by record temperatures, raked Southern California for a second day.

Elsewhere, crews battled flames in Lompoc, Santa Paula, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Anaheim.

The San Diego fires forced evacuations of schools, businesses, homes, a mobile-home park and California State University, San Marcos, along with causing massive traffic jams and stretching firefighting resources almost to the breaking point.

The team will be owned by Blank, who also controls the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. He said it was the culmination of a process that started about a decade ago, when he first started talks with MLS about bringing a team to the city.

While the new stadium is primarily designed for the Falcons, Blank stressed that it will be soccer-friendly. The stands along the sideline will have the capability to retract, accommodating the larger soccer pitch while maintaining sightlines.

BOYLE HEIGHTS, Calif. — Luisa Hilario's ponytail swings from side to side as she races for the train.

Luisa carries her soccer ball and cleats. Her little brother, the first-aid kit. Her mother, Erika, the ice chest, blanket and chair.

Most weekdays, they commute for five hours round-trip — by train, bus and on foot — from Boyle Heights to northeast Pasadena, California, so Luisa can play. The 11-year-old plays for one of California's most elite soccer clubs. Someday, she hopes to compete professionally.

But the family doesn't hustle for the sake of soccer. They hustle for a glimpse of another world.

LOS ANGELES—Heading the ball is a key soccer skill, but a new study finds that players who headed the ball frequently were more likely to suffer brain injury and damage their memory than players who were a little less headstrong, so to speak.

To investigate the issue, Lipton and his colleagues interviewed 37 adult league soccer players from New York City and took high-tech scans of their brains using an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging. They also asked the players how often they played soccer and approximately how often they headed the ball, and they gave the players a battery of neurocognitive tests.

However, Lipton cautioned players not to dismiss the potential risks of excessive headers.

It's a Tower of Babel where unity comes in part through Soccer Without Borders, a program that got its start at this 7-year-old campus and has since spread globally. Founder Ben Gucciardi crafted it precisely to help youths bond across cultural chasms and blossom as leaders in and out of the classroom.

In recent weeks, television ratings for the sport have soared, with games involving Team USA equaling the recent NBA finals and surpassing baseball's World Series. "Watch Parties" drew tens of thousands nationwide and huge crowds at AT&amp;T Stadium in Dallas and Soldier Field in Chicago.

This time around America embraced the "beautiful game" of stunning goals and incomprehensible offsides, joyous nationalism and comic-looking flops due to several key reasons:

Convenient starting times: First-round group games from Brazil began at noon, with another contest to follow and the finale at early evening on the East Coast. They soon became a great reason for an early slide from work.

Short durations: The games take two and a half hours to play. Without timeouts, except for an occasional water break due to the jungle heat, you can set your watch by soccer. Less than three hours to watch a sporting event? That's been downright delightful and makes you realize what time-vampires baseball, football and even college basketball have become with their commercial breaks and incessant timeout during the stretch.

To his credit, American coach Jurgen Klinsmann urged his team to go toe-to-toe with the traditional soccer powers and thanks to scoring star Clint Dempsey and such youngsters as DeAndre Yedlin (20 years old) and Julian Green (19) that often happened. No more siege mentality for this crew, and that's a far cry from former American squads in the World Cup.

Most of the concussions sustained by high school soccer players aren't the result of heading the ball, new research shows. Instead, most head injuries come from athlete-to-athlete contact, the kind of rough play that is against the rules.

The findings challenge the conventional wisdom that heading the ball is the most dangerous part of soccer. Though heading was the most common single activity that led to a concussion, the majority of concussions — 69 percent for boys and 51 percent for girls — came from crashing into another player while defending, goaltending, chasing a loose ball, receiving a pass or dribbling down the field, the researchers reported.

"Consistently in gender-comparable sports like soccer and basketball, where girls and boys play by the same rules using the same equipment, we see higher rates of concussion in girls," Comstock said. "Nobody honestly knows why."

SOCHI, Russia — Flushed with pride after a spectacular showing at the costliest Olympics ever, Russia celebrated 17 days of sport-driven global unity on Sunday night with a farewell show that hands off the Winter Games to their next host, Pyeongchang in South Korea.

Winners of Russia's record 13 gold medals marched into the stadium carrying the country's white, blue and red flag, which was raised alongside the Olympic flag. Athletes streamed by their hundreds into the stadium, dancing and taking photos of themselves. Earlier, giant screens flashed highlights of their Olympic exploits. With a 3-0 victory over Sweden in the men's hockey final Sunday, Canada claimed the last gold from the 98 medal events.

Russia's athletes topped the Sochi medals table, both in golds and total — 33. That represented a stunning turnaround from the 2010 Vancouver Games. There, a meager three golds and 15 total for Russia seemed proof of its gradual decline as a winter sports power since Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Russia's bag of Sochi gold was the biggest-ever haul by a non-Soviet team.

In an Associated Press interview on Saturday, Bach singled out Ukraine's victory in women's biathlon relay as "really an emotional moment" of the games, praising Ukrainian athletes for staying to compete despite the scores dead in protests back home.

"Mourning on the one hand, but knowing what really is going on in your country, seeing your capital burning, and feeling this responsibility, and then winning the gold medal," he said, "this really stands out for me."
The researchers gave the same test to a control group of 54 sixth-graders from the same school who had not yet attended the camp. That group had an average of 12.24 mistakes the first time they took the face-recognition test and 9.81 mistakes when they took it again five days later. For the video test, the students' scores stayed flat, getting an average of 28 percent of the emotions correct both times they were tested.

"I noticed that too," said Uhls, "but even though the kids ended up in the same place, they started at different places, so the change is what we are really looking at."

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California would become the first state to require warning labels on sodas and other sugary drinks under a proposal a state lawmaker announced Thursday.

SB1000 would require the warning on the front of all beverage containers with added sweeteners that have 75 or more calories in every 12 ounces. The label would read: "STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAFETY WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to [obesity](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity), diabetes, and tooth decay."

Democratic Sen. William Monning, who proposed the bill, said there is overwhelming research showing the link between sugary drinks and those health problems, adding that the wording was developed by a national panel of nutrition and public health experts. The bill has the backing of the California Medical Association and the California Center for Public Health Advocacy.

"We agree that obesity is a serious and complex issue," the group said in a statement, but it called Monning's bill "misleading" because it said just 6 percent of calories in the average American's diet come from soda, fruit, sports and energy drinks, compared with 11 percent in sweets and deserts. Moreover, it said most calories are consumed in the form of fats, oils and starches in food.

The medical groups backing Monning's bill countered with their own data, saying sugary drinks are the largest source of added calories in American's diet in the last three decades. They also said one soda a day boosts an adult's chances of being overweight by 27 percent and a child's by 55 percent, and it can increase the risk of diabetes by 26 percent.

Monning equated the warning labels to similar efforts to control alcohol and tobacco and dismissed suggestions that the labeling would be another example of nanny government.

"It is not the responsibility of industry to protect the public health. It is the responsibility of government," he said, noting that consumers could still choose to drink the beverages. "We believe it's an appropriate role for government to play."

Duke University researchers looked at a program called Fast Track, which was started in the early 1990s for children who were identified by their teachers and parents to be at high risk for developing aggressive behavioral problems.

The students were randomized into two groups; half took part in the intervention, which included a teacher-led curriculum, parent training groups, academic tutoring and lessons in self-control and social skills. The program, which lasted from first grade through 10th grade, reduced delinquency, arrests and use of health and mental health services as the students aged through adolescence and young adulthood, as researchers explained in a separate study published earlier this year.

The manufacture of the material involved a multistep process of grinding and heating. By adding different amounts of barium and nickel, the scientists found they could tweak the material so that it could absorb varying wavelengths of visible light.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Researchers are looking to the sun to give hunted and overfished sharks a new ray of hope.

Two dozen fourth- and fifth-grade students at Tildenville Elementary School clustered around him, hoping the panel would power the portable generators they've been building to send to an orphanage in Africa.

WASHINGTON — One of the most broadcast songs of the 20th century, Ben E. King's "Stand by Me," has been selected for preservation at the Library of Congress, along with recordings from Joan Baez, The Righteous Brothers, Steve Martin and the darker sounds of the band Radiohead.

Another referred to an attack that "will be more destructive than ever before," and warned immigrants to stay indoors. "Take (it) serious our friends r killed like Cockroaches."

Violence spread in central Durban on Tuesday, after looters attacked shops owned by immigrants, some of whom armed themselves with machetes and knives. Five have died in the recent violence near Durban, along the country's southeast coast.

Some 2,400 people fled their homes in the Durban violence this past week and have been living in makeshift camps.

JOHANNESBURG — Allyn Bagu lay in bed, listening to the creatures nesting under the roof of her new apartment in suburban Johannesburg. She could hear them scrabbling around and their ominous screeches.

One day, her sister-in-law saw one of them outside their third-floor window and screamed. It was an owl.

"I was thinking of moving," Bagu said, shuddering. "It's bad luck."

Owls are reviled in many parts of Africa as harbingers of death. In South Africa, many believe that when an owl lands on the roof and hoots, it has been sent by a sangoma, or witch doctor, delivering a fatal curse.

Explanations from the shy and soft-spoken Mduduzi seem to quell fears. After he tells people about owls and their behavior, he said, most people agree to accept breeding boxes nearby.

Many probably die of dehydration or other perils in the wild, but some lucky ones end up at The Rhino Orphanage, where workers become mothers to the traumatized young ones, feeding, walking and comforting them until they are ready to return to the bush. They learn to recognize voices, sleep in a stable, feed on a milk substitute, roll in the mud and play with each other and their human minders, who try not to get knocked over by these big, rambunctious babies.

Right now, Trump is leading in South Carolina with 25 percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls in the state. Carson is running second, with 22 percent; 11 percent support Rubio and 7.5 percent Bush.

Jim Drury was at a Trump town hall in Spartanburg last week. "We do need to make America great again," said Drury, 48, a retired firefighter from Union, S.C., who grew up in York, Pa., and relocated after an Air Force career.

"We are losing everything. We're losing the war on terrorism, we're losing our jobs," he said. And with illegal immigration out of control, Drury said, "we're losing the identity of this country."

WASHINGTON — It's a story almost as old as humanity: Braving unknown dangers, a team of explorers settles a wild frontier, and then — almost as quickly — bureaucrats tie it up with red tape.

The FAA has so far been constrained by one major loophole: Once a spacecraft reaches orbit, it is largely free of regulation — a libertarian's final refuge.

Adding to the complexity is a lack of legal precedent. Space law is not an area where the courts have carved much ground, either in the United States or internationally. Because of that, Boeing attorney Russ McMurry said regulators and lawyers might consider finding inspiration in laws once written for wooden ships.

The idea that humans will eventually travel to and inhabit other parts of our galaxy was well expressed by the early Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote, "Earth is humanity's cradle, but you're not meant to stay in your cradle forever." Since then the idea has been a staple of science fiction, and thus become part of a consensus image of humanity's future. Going to the stars is often regarded as humanity's destiny, even a measure of its success as a species. But in the century since this vision was proposed, things we have learned about the universe and ourselves combine to suggest that moving out into the galaxy might not be humanity's destiny after all.

The problem that tends to underlie all the other problems with the idea is the sheer size of the universe, which was not known when people first imagined we would go to the stars. Tau Ceti, one of the closest stars to us at around 12 light-years away, is 100 billion times farther from Earth than our moon. A quantitative difference that large turns into a qualitative difference; we can't simply send people over such immense distances in a spaceship, because a spaceship is too impoverished an environment to support humans for the time it would take, which is on the order of centuries. Instead of a spaceship, we would have to create some kind of space-traveling ark, big enough to support a community of humans and other plants and animals in a fully recycling ecological system.

On the other hand it would have to be small enough to accelerate to a fairly high speed, to shorten the voyagers' time of exposure to cosmic radiation, and to breakdowns in the ark. Regarded from some angles bigger is better, but the bigger the ark is, the proportionally more fuel it would have to carry along to slow itself down on reaching its destination; this is a vicious circle that can't be squared. For that reason and others, smaller is better, but smallness creates problems for resource metabolic flow and ecologic balance. Island biogeography suggests the kinds of problems that would result from this miniaturization, but a space ark's isolation would be far more complete than that of any island on Earth. The design imperatives for bigness and smallness may cross each other, leaving any viable craft in a non-existent middle.

Still, humans are adaptable, and ingenious. It's conceivable that all the problems outlined so far might be solved, and that people enclosed in an ark might cross space successfully to a nearby planetary system. But if so, their problems will have just begun.

So, to conclude: an interstellar voyage would present one set of extremely difficult problems, and the arrival in another system, a different set of problems. All the problems together create not an outright impossibility, but a project of extreme difficulty, with very poor chances of success. The unavoidable uncertainties suggest that an ethical pursuit of the project would require many preconditions before it was undertaken. Among them are these: first, a demonstrably sustainable human civilization on Earth itself, the achievement of which would teach us many of the things we would need to know to construct a viable mesocosm in an ark; second, a great deal of practice in an ark orbiting our sun, where we could make repairs and study practices in an ongoing feedback loop, until we had in effect built a successful proof of concept; third, extensive robotic explorations of nearby planetary systems, to see if any are suitable candidates for habitation.

Unless all these steps are taken, humans cannot successfully travel to and inhabit other star systems. The preparation itself is a multi-century project, and one that relies crucially on its first step succeeding, which is the creation of a sustainable long-term civilization on Earth. This achievement is the necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for any success in interstellar voyaging. If we don't create sustainability on our own world, there is no Planet B.
Scientists are hoping that many gaps in our understanding will be filled in by Voyager 2. The sister spacecraft, which was also launched in 1977, is nearing the edge of the heliosphere via a different path and is expected to encounter interstellar space sometime within the next several years.

Unlike Voyager 1, however, Voyager 2 has a fully functioning plasma science instrument and has been sending back density readings throughout its journey.

"I think it's going to teach us even more about this region," Stone said. 
LOS ANGELES — Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo, part of an ambitious commercial space venture founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, crashed during testing Friday and broke into several pieces. One test pilot was killed and another was injured.

"From my eyes and ears, I detected nothing that appeared abnormal," he said. "If there was a huge explosion, I didn't hear it." He said a 90-second pause led him to think something had gone wrong.

"It's rocket science. It's dangerous, it's risky, it's complicated. Most of us who bought tickets know that," he said. "I expected there to be accidents … I'm very sad and shocked that it was in such a spectacular fashion today, but it's not going to change my view."

Friday's accident was not the first for the program. In 2007, during a test of the spaceship's propulsion system, an explosion at the Mojave Desert airport killed three workers and injured three others.

![](https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140602_Europe_royals.jpg)MADRID — Spain's King Juan Carlos I told his compatriots Monday he had opted to abdicate to his son Felipe, arguing that "a new generation demands, with justice, the leading role."

When dictator Francisco Franco decided that, upon his death, the country's monarchy should be restored, he picked Juan Carlos as heir. The 10-year-old boy had to return to a homeland he did not know.

During the coup, the king rallied loyal generals and ultimately gave a stirring televised speech to the nation, becoming one of the European monarchs to have had the greatest impact on his or her country's modern history. The king was said to have turned Spaniards into "juancarlists" rather than monarchists.

"You have to earn your crown every day," Juan Carlos told his son and heir, Felipe.

His relaxed style was counterbalanced by that of his more formal wife, Greek-born Queen Sofia. His three children — Prince Felipe and Princesses Elena and Cristina — shared in their parents' popularity.

SEATTLE — On a recent morning, in a roomful of people dedicated to keeping the centuries-old Jewish language of Ladino alive, Doreen Alhadeff explained why she plans to become a Spanish citizen.

LOS ANGELES — For decades, finding Spanish-language books in the U.S. was like tilting at windmills.

Booksellers stocked few titles in the language of Cervantes, and those they carried came at a hefty premium. A paperback copy of "Don Quixote" in the original Spanish could easily cost triple the price of a deluxe hard-bound translation in English — if it could be found at all.

Retailers blamed the expense of importing books printed in Spain and Latin America. And U.S. publishers lost faith in the market after botched attempts to translate English-language bestsellers produced error-ridden Spanish versions that sold poorly.

"There was a tremendous appetite for Spanish-language books that wasn't being met," said David Kipen, who runs Libros Schmibros, a used-book store in Boyle Heights with a large Latino clientele. "We might have 1,000 books in Spanish, but we're always ravenous for more."

Today, the software consultant said, he finds a seemingly endless supply of interesting electronic titles in his native language, including arcane technical tomes and science fiction novellas he likes to read on flights. To date, he's bought 97 Spanish e-books for his Kindle. And he's completely given up on printed books.

The digital expansion in Spanish has also had spillover benefits for printed books in Spanish as foreign publishers grow more optimistic about the U.S. market.

Last year, the Library of Congress acquired 9,974 titles published in Spain, compared with 8,178 in 2009, according to Beacher Wiggins, the library's director of acquisitions and bibliographic access. Independent Publishers Group, a national distributor based in Chicago, has seen its revenue from Spanish-language print books jump 40 percent over the last five years, according to Diana Calice, head of Spanish books at the company.

And in July, the paperback version of "Inquebrantable," the autobiography of deceased recording artist Jenni Rivera, hit the No. 1 spot on all of Amazon.com, outselling every other book on the e-commerce site — including "Unbreakable," the English version of the same memoir.

WICHITA, Kan. — Students who participate on special-needs sports teams will now receive varsity letters, following a unanimous vote by the Wichita school board to accept a new handbook crafted by the Tri-County Athletic League, a league for students with special needs with teams at 11 area high schools. The six-page handbook includes criteria for earning an athletic letter.

Words that knocked out spellers in the second on-stage round included jeroboam (a wine bottle), obtundent (having the power to dull pain), palatalize (use of the tongue in producing sounds) and diphtheria (a childhood illness).

As in prior years, the spellers often distinguished themselves with jaunty greetings for the longtime pronouncer, Bailly, such as 14-year-old Sriram Hathwar of Painted Post, New York, whose cheery, "Hello, Dr. Bailly and friends," brought nervous laughter from the crowd in the grand ballroom of the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.

Again this year there are spellers who write invisible words on the backs of their name-and-number placards, on arms, on hands and in the air. Others bite lower lips, tousle their own hair or stick hands deep in pockets. Standouts sought to engage the crowd with their own brief stand-up comedy routine, as when Neha Seshadri, 13, of Detroit, asked Bailly: "May I take a deep breath, please?" When he said yes, she replied, "Back to business."

Ed Horan, 14, of Hoboken, New Jersey, had the crowd breathless as he appeared stumped by the word for puppets moved by overhead strings, then nailed fantoccini. Similarly, Mary Polking, 14, of Charlotte, North Carolina, repeated the first few letters of the word for a man's felt hat, started over twice, then committed herself to the right vowel in the second syllable, and spelled homburg.

Some of the words few use in conversation have become standards that the students have heard year after year befalling their predecessors, such as mandir (a Hindu temple), quisling (a turncoat), jeremiad (an angry tirade) foggara (an underground conduit for carrying water), tarragon (an aromatic spice), Baedeker (travel guidebooks), and bobbejaan (an Afrikaans word for baboon). The languages of origin for Wednesday's words ranged from Algonquin, Javanese and Yiddish to Russian, Dutch, Persian, Latin and Greek.

For college athletes who get through their sport's season concussion-free, new research suggests it may be too early to breathe a sigh of relief.

The findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that a season-long succession of small hits — none hard enough to cause evident disorientation or draw medical attention — may prompt changes in the brain that cause problems with memory, mood or mental performance years down the road.

Or, they may heal during the off-season. Scientists are still trying to figure out how readily the brain recovers from injury, or whether there are thresholds beyond which damage can be cumulative or irreversible.

The new results don't resolve the matter, but they do suggest that repetitive blows to the head are not without consequence, even when an athlete is able to get up and keep playing, said study leader Thomas McAllister, a psychiatrist at Indiana University.

But it will take far more research to discern whether there are certain athletes who don't heal as well, or for whom small changes in the brain structure can have outsized, and possibly delayed, effects.

Ryan Bennett of Kansas City records a few programs and doesn't demand much from his television entertainment.

But he wants his sports . . . when he wants his sports.

But according to the media research and analysts firm SNL Kagan, basic cable customers paid an average of $5.06 a month for ESPN in 2012, making ESPN, which has nearly 100 million subscribers, by far the most expensive product on basic cable. Other companies are looking to cash in as well — Fox recently announced it's launching a national sports channel to rival ESPN. In the grand scheme of things, the deal seems reasonable to sports fans. For about the price of a large Frappuccino at Starbucks, you get a month's worth of America's best live sports lineup. The rub is, non-sports watchers or those who don't want some sports channels also are paying and have no choice in the matter.

WASHINGTON — Harry Potter, Elvis Presley and Bugs Bunny share one thing in common: Traditional stamp collectors are no fans.

"It helps me concentrate," said Adam, who kept up a brisk pace on the elliptical, while engrossed in a book by Louis Sachar. <img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/LIFE_EDU-FIT-DESKS_TB.jpg" />

The outbreak, known as "wasting syndrome," has infected at least 20 different species of sea stars since it was first detected in Washington's Olympic Peninsula in June 2013. It spread to Oregon, Monterey Bay, Big Sur and as far south as Baja California, even killing starfish in major aquariums in Seattle, Vancouver, Monterey and other cities.

WASHINGTON — With millions of starfish dying all along the West Coast, Washington state Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives say it's time for Congress to intervene and find out why.

The outbreak, first noticed in the state by rangers in Olympic National Park in June 2013, has hit 20 species of starfish, also known as sea stars.

After getting lesions on their bodies, the sea stars begin curling up and soon lose their legs, shriveling up and disintegrating into mush.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20140205_STARFISH.jpg" />ANCHORAGE, Alaska — In the aquarium at the Anchorage Museum, starfish, silent and slow, cling to rocks and wait to be lifted out of the tank for petting.

These five-armed creatures hardly seem prone to ecological drama. But last fall, the museum's starfish started showing signs of a disease that scientists say is killing starfish colonies up and down the West Coast.

Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome, as it's called, have been reported as unnatural twisting of the arms and white lesions on the surface of a starfish's skin. A speedy death comes after a loss of arms and softening of tissue.

Following a social media firestorm over the lack of Rey in a new "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" Monopoly game, Disney says it is unveiling a raft of new merchandise that puts more of Rey front and center — including toys featuring her gripping a blue lightsaber.

Twitter erupted over the holidays using the hashtag "#wheresrey" at the dearth of Rey merchandise in stores, despite her playing a key role in the film. Last week, days after an 8-year-old girl wrote Monopoly maker Hasbro, saying "girls matter," both Disney's Lucasfilm and Hasbro decided to add a Rey piece to future editions later this year.

But Disney had also planned for more than a year to hold back certain toys to avoid giving away the key plot point where she picks up the lightsaber wielded by Finn in order to duel new baddie Kylo Ren.

"Young people need to have a healthy lifestyle and truly experience the nature of the world and not some virtual reality through a gaming device," said Lewis Ledford, executive director of the National Association of State Park Directors. "Smelling the fresh air, understanding the stars at night, knowing about the life cycles of ecology -- this is important for the stewardship of future generations and is vital in conserving and protecting our natural resources."

"If our future leaders have no relationship to nature, no understanding of how clean air and clean water are produced and what a healthy environment is, they won't have the knowledge, nor will they care about, doing anything about the stewardship of the Earth," said Nita Settina, superintendent for the Maryland Park Service. "That's why we need to provide children with adventures and fun — so they become park visitors and will someday expose their children to those places."

Maryland has been running its jobs program for eight years. This summer, about 300 teens, working in teams, received the state minimum wage of $8.25 an hour to conserve and restore parks. They built trails, refurbished picnic pavilions, cleaned streams, planted trees and created butterfly gardens. They also spent part of their time canoeing, fishing and camping.

California became the first state to pass a law mandating "e-cycling" — electronic recycling or recycling e-waste — in 2003. Under its program, consumers pay a fee that supports e-cycling when they buy a product. The remaining 24 states and Washington, D.C., put the cost of e-cycling programs on manufacturers, often by requiring them to pay for the collection and processing of a certain amount of e-waste based on how much they sell within the state.

NEW YORK — Romance can be tumultuous, and no one knows that better than the Statue of Liberty. Over and over, Lady Liberty has been separated from her adoring public, most recently by an uninvited guest named Sandy who stormed through, leaving heartbreak and ruin in her wake.

For eights months, the statue stood alone in New York Harbor, but the painful breakup was pushed aside Thursday as visitors returned to the Statue of Liberty for the first time since the superstorm shut her down on Oct. 29, 2012. It was the third closure since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

"I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little bit tired of reopening and closing the Statue of Liberty," David Luchsinger, the national monument's superintendent, said with a laugh as the sun beat down on Liberty's golden torch. "I think this time we'll just leave it alone."

As he spoke, hundreds of thousands of visitors swarmed Lady Liberty and her home, Liberty Island, a short ferry ride from lower Manhattan and uninhabited save for the 127-year-old woman who symbolizes freedom, from her shimmering torch to the broken chain at her feet.

As the first tourist boat of the day circled the island and visitors got a close-up view of Liberty's strong jaw and steady-gazing eyes, they fell quiet. Many lowered their cell phones, stopped taking pictures, and just stared.

Three goggle-wearing conservators zap away dirt from the marble maidens with custom-designed lasers, as tourists watch the operation on monitors. The restoration work is surrounded by a white fabric screen to protect visitors from laser beams, which can cause permanent eye injury.

One of the six Caryatids was removed by Lord Elgin in the 19th century and today stands in the British Museum. The other five were removed from the Erechtheion in 1979 to protect them from air pollution and acid rain, and replaced by copies.

Acropolis Museum director Dimitris Pantermalis said the main reason for cleaning the sculptures on the spot was to avoid the potential hazards of moving them. But there's the additional value of offering tourists the spectacle of restoring some of the greatest glories of the ancient world.

If it works, the new technique could buy these children time as scientists scramble for a cure for the congenital defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS).

The Mayo study, which will begin as soon as 10 eligible candidates can be enrolled, could also pave the way for additional breakthroughs in stem cell treatments that would help the 19,000 children born each year with other heart defects. But for the time being, the doctors at Mayo are keeping their focus on those babies who need the most help now.

Christina DeShaw of Clive, Iowa, was pregnant with fraternal twins when she learned during an ultrasound procedure that the left side of her daughter's heart was not developing properly.

DeShaw and her husband, Brad Weitl, sought help from the Mayo Clinic for the baby they named Ava Grace.

They learned that children born with defects on the left side of the heart must undergo a series of three complex surgeries. The first is called the Norwood procedure: Within a few days of birth, surgeons reconstruct the heart so that the fully developed right ventricle can do both its own work of supplying blood to the lungs and the work of the defective left ventricle, which ordinarily would pump oxygenated blood back to the body.

The second and third surgeries are much safer. They involve rerouting blood from the body directly to the lungs, bypassing the heart entirely to reduce the workload of the right ventricle.

Behfar, working with Dr. Andre Terzic, a Mayo cardiovascular specialist, found that stem cells typically lose their vitality as they age and apparently become "sick" along with the patient. Mayo just finished a clinical trial in Europe showing that they could kick-start those cells in a way that significantly improves the patient's health, cuts treatment costs and improves quality of life.

Nelson dedicated himself to finding a cure for hypoplastic left heart syndrome when he was studying to become a pediatric heart surgeon. He said it tore him up to know that babies who endured three open heart surgeries would often return as young children with irreparable heart damage and little likelihood of finding a donor heart in time to save them.

Some research suggested that half the children with HLHS don't make it to their fifth birthday, Nelson said, but there are also children living into their early 20s. "So there are wonderful success stories of the surgical practice," he said. "But obviously, the percentage of kids born that make it to that stage is far too low."

C.J. Nitkowski had nothing to lose in spring 2011. The rotator cuff in his left shoulder that he'd relied on during his decade as a major league pitcher was in tatters. He was 38 and his fastball traveled a Little League-worthy 50 mph.

"I look at it as a last shot," Nitkowski said.

There will likely be a proposal to introduce tiny wasps as predators of stink bugs within a year, Weber said. The wasps lay their eggs on other insects' eggs, allowing the newly hatched wasps to eat the eggs of their prey — including stink bugs.

Not knowing much about Hope, including how long she had been on her own, Skaziak renamed her Rousey, after the popular mixed martial arts fighter Ronda Rousey.

Back in August at Char-Will, the first dog that was considered was Lola, another German shepherd. She looked much healthier than Hope but seemed distracted and not eager to fetch balls. The verdict was swift.

NEW YORK — A woman in a head scarf gazes piercingly from the side of a Brooklyn brownstone. A flock of spray-painted birds breaks free from shackles on a Manhattan building. A Harlem mural shows a giant teal gazelle against a black background, barren trees and a peacock feather.

DALLAS — A 14-year-old Muslim student will face no criminal charges for taking a homemade clock to class that his suburban Dallas high school teachers thought resembled a bomb, the police chief said Wednesday.

The teen explained to The Dallas Morning News that he makes his own radios, repairs his own go-kart and on Sunday spent about 20 minutes before bedtime assembling the clock using a circuit board, a power supply wired to a digital display, and other items.

In a tweet posted Wednesday, Obama called Ahmed's clock "cool" and said more kids should be inspired like him to enjoy science, because "it's what makes America great."

WASHINGTON — If it's springtime, it must be standardized testing time in schools across the country.

Experts say testing is up. Parents who want their children to skip the tests say their ranks are growing. Lawmakers say they're hearing a loud message about too much unnecessary testing.

What's not are the complaints. Some parents worry that schools base their lesson plans on what the tests focus on. Poor test-takers are at a disadvantage. Critics say too much money is spent on testing. The consequences of failure can mean closed schools, lost jobs and an impact on student progress.

Such technologies have become increasingly common in schools, which use them to take attendance, alert parents where their children get off the school bus or speed up lunch lines.

This year, Florida became the first state to ban the use of biometric identification in its schools. Kansas said biometric data cannot be collected without student or parental consent. New Hampshire, Colorado and North Carolina said the state education departments cannot collect and store biometric data as part of student records.

"Technology is moving so fast," said Paige Kowalski, director of state policy and advocacy for the campaign. "I think that's why you're seeing these new laws. I think people are nervous about it. It's new. It's different from when we were kids."

"It's more secure from a privacy standpoint than a student ID, which has a name, picture and school on it — when lost, can be picked up by someone," said Fry, an educator for 25 years.

CHICAGO — The tension between the two Manley High School students started on Facebook, with a wall post that asked a direct, but loaded, question.

There, the girls sat in a circle of chairs, talked and listened to each other until they worked out their problems.

"I came down here and talked before I reacted," Aaliyah said after their session. "That way, 'cause if anything did happen, it wouldn't be my bad. I'd be at fault, but I came down and warned them," she said.

At Manley and Fenger Academy High School on the South Side, administrators have created peace rooms where students and workers can retreat to work out problems.

Harris, a senior, learned from that student the steps for breaking through tension. Then she became a peer conflict resolver herself. Now, she's quick to pull her friends and family members into a circle and talk their problems over.

Each practice seems to bring a new drama.

"What happened to your face?" Jones asked a girl who arrived tonight with scratches and welts on her cheeks. The teenager said she had been fighting with classmates who bullied her.

A tall young man approached Jones to say hi; he had been pistol-whipped a few days earlier in a robbery. "How you doing, baby?" Jones said.

But the drill team keeps going, with Jones doing all she can to keep the children in school. She helps with their homework. She finds tutors for struggling pupils. She meets with their parents or guardians to be sure someone is watching over them.

"I don't want to see them go extinct," she said. "This whole thing has to do with saving lives, not just marching in front of the cameras."

Her grandfather bought uniforms and three drums. Jones, who loved dancing, cheerleading and marching, began holding practices for dozens of children under bridges, in parks or on streets because she could not afford to rent a hall. Robert, her high school sweetheart, played drums as Jones taught dance steps and led the team through marches and exercises.

Jones attended college for two years but dropped out to care for her grandfather. She and Robert worked at a social services agency, helping mentally disabled adults find work. In their free time, they oversaw drill team practices, fundraisers and performances.

Last year, after a string of TV and public appearances led to an influx of donations, Jones quit her job to devote herself full time to the drill team. Her daughter, LaQuicia, 23, volunteers time to choreograph routines; her oldest son, Robert Jr., 17, helps his father on drums at practices. None of them, including Jones, receives a salary for working with the team, which is established as a nonprofit.

The Sophisticated Sisters have to follow Jones' strict rules: Children must complete 200 hours of community service a year, keep up with their homework and maintain at least a C average.

Jones takes the older children on college tours, often paying for the trips herself. Destiny Bush, now 24, went on one of the tours, visiting three universities with Jones after joining the drill team as an eighth-grader.

"I come from a family where over 90 percent of the people don't even have high school diplomas," said Bush, who is pursuing her master's in education at Washington State University.

WASHINGTON — Of all the issues the Obama administration is grappling with, a modest redesign of what food labels say about sweeteners might not have seemed among the more controversial. But ever since First Lady Michelle Obama unveiled the plan last year, a lobbying frenzy has ensued.

WASHINGTON — Charity Edwards is unemployed and separated from her husband, raising four kids on a monthly income of $1,100.

"There's not money left to buy clothes," said Edwards, 38, of Everett, Washington.

Murray jumped into the latest food fray on Capitol Hill, where members of Congress are bickering over school lunch rules, including how much to spend on poor children and what foods would most benefit them.

Murray, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the head of the Senate Budget Committee, said she was ready for the financial arguments but that she was banking on support for her hunger bill from Democrats and Republicans alike.

Numbers are hard to come by, but participation in the Wanpaku sumo tournament, an event for children, has dropped from 70,000 kids in 1994 to 33,000 in 2014. Starting last year, a qualifying round was held in Mongolia, and one will be held in Hawaii for the first time this year.

LOS ANGELES — California and New York still lure hundreds of thousands of immigrants from across the globe, but Texas, Florida, Colorado and the Carolinas are far more magnetic for people already living in the country, according to new estimates released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The fresh estimates are also another way of measuring whether the recession, which clamped down on state-to-state movement, has loosened its grip on American migration. Scholars said the new data, which gauged movement between July 2012 and July 2013, showed only feeble signs of recovery.

The snowbelt-to-sunbelt migration that characterized the boom years has resumed, but only sluggishly, Brookings Institution senior fellow William Frey said. In the wake of the recession, millennials have remained cautious about moving, putting a drag on state-to-state migration, he said.

In recent weeks, San Francisco has sent workers to the Embarcadero to help the homeless find shelter somewhere other than Super Bowl City. The free fan village will feature concerts, interactive games and player appearances at the foot of Market Street across from the Ferry Building, and will be among the main images broadcast of San Francisco. If the city's plan succeeds, the homeless will head to shelters where they can connect with social services.

"When a lot of cameras are going to be pointed on the city, they want to have an image of the city that does not include poverty," said Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director at the San Francisco-based Coalition on Homelessness. "They want to decrease the physical presence and reminder of poverty and create an illusion that poverty does not exist by removing poor people from the vicinity of the Super Bowl party."

There are 500 to 700 people on the waiting list for shelter at any given time, said Jackie Jenks, executive director of San Francisco-based Hospitality House, which runs a shelter that can house 30 men.

Yet in 2015, 92 percent of high school students graduated on time, and 78 percent of those graduates had enrolled in the military or post-secondary training within six months of graduation, according to state data. Gov. Jay Nixon (D) invited Anderson and a student to his state of the state address this year, praising Jennings for its "big leaps forward."

Jennings still has a ways to go. Most students are not proficient in math and reading, and just 36 percent of the graduates in 2015 scored high enough on the ACT, SAT or similar tests to meet Missouri's definition of "college and career ready." But almost every academic indicator has been improving.

A stunning photo went viral over the weekend, revealing a supertide that turned an 11th-century French abbey that is usually surrounded by sheep into an island swallowed by the sea. The image, from The Associated Press, is shown here.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The waves in the Fort Pierce Inlet jetty were picking up on Saturday, so Ryan Shapiro and his friends decided to make a move on their surfboards.

That's when he felt it: A 4-foot shark had bitten into his right arm, tearing through it but not ripping it off completely.

Shapiro, a Boca Raton resident, was attacked at about 4:30 p.m. while at the park. He was transported to the Lawnwood Regional Medical Center, where he underwent surgery later that day. While the experience has physically scarred him, three days later, he said he refuses to let the attack lessen his passion for surfing and the sea.

She saw her brother being escorted from the water by five or six other surfers. His arm was above his head and people were rushing over with T-shirts, towels and sweaters to make tourniquets. It would take 10 minutes for the ambulance to arrive, but it seemed like it took longer.

But some women are out to challenge tradition. They're learning the art of sushi at a time when the government is emphasizing a greater role for women to offset Japan's shrinking workforce.

"I think women are better at communicating with customers, and they're kind and gentle," said Yuki Chidui, 28, sushi chef and manager at the all-women Nadeshico sushi restaurant in Tokyo.

LOS ANGELES — In the last three years, Marcquees Banks has been taken out of class twice and sent to another school for getting into fights.

The third time he got into a scuffle, something different happened: A counselor at Augustus Hawkins High School in South Los Angeles pulled Banks and the other teen aside and told them they needed to talk.

Seated face to face, Joseph Luciani asked them to explain why they'd fought and how they felt — part of the school's new approach to discipline that is catching on in urban districts and focuses more on students working out their differences with counselors than suspensions.

STOCKHOLM — The evacuation of a squalid Roma camp this week has forced Sweden to come to terms with a troubling new reality: For the first time in generations, the egalitarian welfare nation is witnessing people living in abject poverty, without basic amenities such as electricity and running water.

Unlike the asylum seekers, who are housed in government-run refugee shelters, the Roma mostly fend for themselves. As EU citizens they do not qualify for asylum, which is reserved for refugees fleeing war and persecution.

In a scene reminiscent of the Cold War, Swedish naval ships, helicopters and ground troops combed the Stockholm archipelago for a fourth day Monday for signs of a foreign submarine or smaller underwater craft that officials suspect entered Swedish waters illegally.

Dinosaurs were long thought to be landlubbers. But the 95-million-year-old Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, described in a study in the journal Science, features the first-ever dinosaur whose body evolved to live a life partly in the water, and could contradict many assumptions about dinosaur evolution.

At 50 feet long, Spinosaurus was likely the largest predatory dinosaur to walk the Earth (9 feet longer than T. rex, which did not live in the same time period). It had a long thin snout with conical teeth that jutted diagonally from its mouth — perfect for snapping at fish. Its nostrils were small and pushed far up on its skull — ideal for breathing while partly submerged. Odd openings at the front of the snout could have housed pressure sensors, rather like the ones on alligators and crocodiles that help them sense movement to hunt in murky water.

Like other known spinosaur species, Spinosaurus aegyptiacus also sported the bony "sail" on its back, a dramatic display that stayed above the water as it swam. But James Kirkland of the Utah Geological Survey thinks perhaps, in this swimming species, it really might have been used as a sail, to keep moving without alerting other animals to its massive presence. In the water, Spinosaurus would have lived in a predator's paradise, filled with other fearsome meat-eaters — including sharks, coelacanths, sawfish and lungfish.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20130613_SYRIA_deaths_1.jpg" />ALEPPO, Syria — The family members stood shivering on a balcony in Aleppo's Anadan suburb as midnight approached, their sleep interrupted by the nightly duty of a government helicopter pilot somewhere above them.

They followed the sound of the helicopter's whirring blades as well as scratchy updates coming over a walkie-talkie from rebels spread throughout the area.

Three years into Syria's conflict, the cacophony of war has become a familiar companion to daily life here in the country's largest city, the sad soundtrack to its gradual demolition and a shrinking civilian population struggling to survive.

On a recent day in an Aleppo vegetable market, a warplane's low rumble halted all transactions and conversation.

Unripe almonds and lettuce were momentarily forgotten as everyone turned their faces upward to track the plane by its sound. Drivers slowed down and stuck their heads out the window to look up.

Not until the rumble had faded, leaving only a billowy white trail across the sky, did the people return their attention to the mundane particulars of life. The plane was now the concern of another Aleppo neighborhood.

As he drove away from the market, Saleh Laila said, "If it had been a helicopter, they would watch it till it dropped the barrel, then pandemonium would break out and cars would start driving into each other and people would run, trying to get away."

A couple of charred and stripped vehicles mark the entrance of rebel-held Aleppo, a fitting welcome to a city that in some parts is a barren urban landscape.

The helicopter attacks day and night, coupled with poundings by warplanes and artillery as well as regular clashes between government and rebel forces, have transformed the once-vibrant commercial hub into one with entire neighborhoods deserted.

More than two-thirds of the city's population is estimated to have fled north either to Turkey or, for those not allowed passage into the country, along its border in ramshackle refugee tents. Certain suburbs have also seen a large exodus.

As one Aleppo resident said of the city, "There are fighters, activists and shop owners. No one else is left."

Before their world collapsed around them, they were living happily in Homs, the nation's third-largest city, where they met, were married and had their first child. They made a good home for themselves. He worked as a painter. She went to school to learn English. But in 2011, that all ended.

"We were sitting in my house when … it was destroyed over our heads," said Fadi Adris, recalling the bomb that leveled the family home.

The agreement also calls for what one U.S. official called an "ambitious" timeline for dealing with Syria's chemical weapons, setting a November deadline for eliminating that country's ability to manufacture and mix the weapons and calling for the destruction of all materials that could be used to make such weapons by the middle of next year.

President Barack Obama welcomed the U.S.-Russian agreement, calling it an "important, concrete step" toward the goal of destroying the weapons. He warned, however, that "if diplomacy fails, the United States remains prepared to act."

But the prospect of a U.S. military strike, which seemed just hours away only two weeks ago, now appears remote. The agreement suggests that a military strike could be authorized "in the event of non-compliance," but that would come only after approval by the U.N. Security Council, where Russia holds a veto. In remarks before reporters here, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said such intervention was off the table for now.

It is unusual, but not unheard of, for a foreign leader to publish commentary in an American newspaper as a way of influencing U.S. public opinion. Putin began his piece by saying that the furor over Syrian chemical weapons "prompted me to speak directly to the American people and their political leaders." He added, "It is important to do so at a time of insufficient communication between our societies."

Civil war in Syria has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee the Middle Eastern country and seek refuge in Turkey, Lebanon and other neighboring nations. More than 70,000 civilians have been killed since the war began in March 2011. The climbing death toll has put pressure on the United States and its allies to intervene, especially as fears mount that the Syrian government may use chemical weapons against innocent civilians and rebel forces.

It is still unclear if the Syrian military is using chemical weapons. The BBC reported that it saw a video that appeared to show victims of a chemical attack. President Barack Obama said on Thursday the United States has seen evidence of chemical weapons but that "more specific information" was needed. If it can be proven that  Syria is poisoning its own people, Obama may have to face an extremely tough decision: after Afghanistan and Iraq, can the United States afford to get involved in yet another overseas war?

In August 2012, Obama said that if the Syrian government decided to use chemical weapons, that act would be a "red line" for his administration. He did not explain the meaning of "red line," but it was widely thought that the term would mean the United States would use its military power to help overthrow the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.

"If they're going to strike, let them strike once and for all and bring the regime down," grumbled Um Hafiz, who fled with her husband and five children from their village near Syria's southern city of Daara in January.

Other residents said Sunday that they worried that Obama's decision to first seek congressional authorization for a U.S. military operation would so embolden Syrian President Bashar Assad that he might even dare to attack Zaatari, a major recruiting ground for rebel fighters about five miles inside Jordan.

"We were happy when we first heard that the U.S. would attack, but then when it was postponed, we were afraid that Bashar would attack the camp," said Raad Zoubi, 23, who has lived in the dusty, sun-stricken swath of tents and prefabricated metal huts for the past year. "People are angry, but when the Americans do attack, we will be happy they do."

MAJDAL ANJAR, Lebanon — Along with some 20 other Syrian children, 13-year-old Anas braves rain, mud and cold to attend class in a tent pitched along Lebanon's border with Syria, the home of a Syrian refugee family that serves as a classroom for four hours each day.

By the end of last year, school-age Syrian children in Lebanon — currently estimated at 400,000 — outnumbered their Lebanese peers by 100,000. Some 45,000 are now enrolled in Lebanon's public schools, UNICEF says, while another 32,000 attend two and a half hours of classes in the afternoon, mostly to catch up and improve their foreign languages skills to a point to be enrolled. Many struggle because subjects like math and science are taught in English and French in Lebanon instead of in Arabic.

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is outfitting a 647-foot cargo ship with high-tech equipment in an effort to safely destroy hundreds of tons of lethal chemical weapons agents that were collected in Syria after a deadly gas attack this summer sparked an international outcry.

Two specially developed hydrolysis machines, which use water or bleach to neutralize the chemicals that produce nerve gases, have been installed aboard the Cape Ray at the U.S. naval base in Norfolk, Va., officials said Thursday.

With Syria engulfed in civil war, moving the deadly material to the U.S. naval ship over the next month may be the biggest challenge.

"We watch the news, and we hope something will happen, but in truth we have no confidence," said Um Ammar, a mother who, like others interviewed, preferred to be identified by a nickname for security reasons. "People are laughing at us."

Separately, the United States conducted eight airstrikes west of Aleppo targeting a militant faction known as the "Khorasan Group," a shadowy network of "seasoned al-Qaida veterans" that was allegedly plotting an "imminent attack ... against the United States and Western interests," the Central Command statement said, without elaboration.

CAIRO — On the outskirts of the vast Egyptian capital, Egypt ends and the latest Syria enclave begins. Women tie their headscarves in a distinctly Syrian way. They buy Syrian spices and trinkets from vendors whose shops are now tables lined along the streets. There is a constant murmur of stories about the desperate circumstances that forced the residents to flee places such as Homs and Damascus in the past year.

The Syrian has heard this a dozen times already that day and doesn't even respond, but rather points to a professionally made sign in front of the mosque behind him. It says that the mosque "announces that it has nothing to do with the marriage of Egyptian men to Syrian sisters. That's why there shouldn't be any questions regarding this issue in any of the offices of the organization. May Allah punish those responsible for spreading these rumors."

The painter is undeterred. "Maybe there are Syrian women around the corner?" he asks.

The Syrian, who asks that he be identified only as Khalid, just shakes his head. Before the sign, Khalid said, he fielded the question 100 times a day; now it is only 50. It's difficult to know if he's exaggerating.

That Egyptian men believe they could marry someone for less is changing marriage across Egypt. Men are demanding more of women and are willing to offer less, women report, and the standards for taking a bride are falling. Where an Egyptian man was once expected to provide a home and prove he can work before he could marry, now many believe they can have a Syrian bride for as little as $45.

"We were 40 or 50 swimmers, and now we are maybe 10 or seven swimmers in Syria," said Sarah. "We want to have a future. I want to be in college, I want to be an international swimmer and my sister too. But if we stay there we will not reach that because the situation is not OK in Syria."

The words are bound in blood and speak of graves and broken bones.

The poetry radiating from the Syrian civil war echoes with nostalgia, bombs and betrayals; it slips into the lives of torn-apart families and boys of defiance who have grown into men with bandoleers and Kalashnikovs. It is the verse of the forsaken in a nation of madmen with black flags, cities of ruin and rivers of refugees.

The poems flow in slipstreams of syllables, beats and rhythms composed by writers, doctors, mothers, activists and Syrians who live abroad but are compelled to articulate the suffering in their ancestral land. They are all connected: The old man in a Turkish refugee camp clings to a few pages of his scribbled verse. Syrian-American hip-hop artist Omar Offendum riffs through songs of admonition and loss. And Amal Kassir summons the blistered hands and shattered orchard on her grandmother's farm.

The war has "captivated all of my poetry," said Kassir, who is finalizing a collection of poems titled "Scud Missile Blues." "It's something profound when you can compare the color of a pomegranate to the color of blood on the ground. There is color and scent and sound involved."

Dunia became known for her Facebook posts on the plight of women and those who vanished in Syria's prisons. She contributed an essay to the book "Diaries of an Unfinished Revolution: Voices From Tunis to Damascus," in which she wrote, "No voice can be heard above the gunfire." Kahf has been translating Dunia's poems into English, including a draft of one called "Sniper":

_Limb that leans on fate,_

_Who taught you what you are doing to me?_

_This moment which joins us:_

The vigor of the revolution's early days, however, has been sapped by years of barrel bombs, quickly dug graves and the feeling of many Syrians that their nation has been cut adrift by the international community and turned into a land of barren fields and proxy wars.

Behind the heavy brown door that opens into the Maryland Table Tennis Center, balls ping, zing, pop and pong, hair flies, sneakers squeak and laughter echoes off the walls. Oblivious to the noise, Crystal Wang, 13, finishes her homework in a corner, and then heads over to a blue table. She picks up a rubber-coated paddle, bends her knees, leans into her toes and looks into her opponent's eyes. She shifts her weight, pulls back her arm and delivers a serve with a feather-light touch.

Nick Stepka knew what gift would make his daughter's 3rd birthday a hit, and it wasn't a toy or doll.

"Seventy years — it's been a long struggle," said Wang, who has a doctorate in electrical engineering and also invests in real estate. "Finally, we are going to overcome the KMT."

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131112_TALLEST_SKYSCRAPER.jpg" />NEW YORK — A panel of building experts on Tuesday anointed New York's new World Trade Center tower the nation's tallest skyscraper, accepting its spire as part of a design that makes it 1,776 feet high and that knocks Chicago's Willis Tower out of the No. 1 spot.

Architect Rick Bell, the executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, said the new building, like the old, speaks to the national and international aspiration for height.

WASHINGTON — Anyone under the age of 18 would be barred from using indoor tanning equipment, under a federal proposal to help reduce skin cancer linked to the devices.

Friday's announcement follows years of prodding by dermatologists and medical groups for bolder action on indoor tanning, citing rising rates of skin cancer among teens and people in their 20s, particularly women. The leading professional group for skin specialists applauded the news.

The FDA will take public comments on its proposals for 90 days before beginning work to finalize them. There is no deadline for putting them in place.
WASHINGTON — Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified a puzzling and unsettling new cancer-like condition in a 41-year-old man, who is believed to have become ill through a common stomach bug.

"In the initial months, we wondered if this was a weird human cancer or some unusual, bizarre emerging protozoa-amoeba-like infection," he recalled. "Discovering these cells had tapeworm DNA was a big surprise — a really big surprise."

It's unclear how common this type of tapeworm cancer illness is in humans, but experts like Pritt believe it's likely that there are more cases out there: "H. nana is a very common tapeworm infection in humans, and therefore I would expect there to be other cases like the one described ... that were misdiagnosed or went undetected."

"The Tatars should watch their step now," said Alexander Zhilkin, a 46-year-old businessman from the city of Bakhchisaray who carried a Russian national flag to protest the presence of a Ukrainian military unit in Simferopol. "They keep talking of gaining their own autonomy within Crimea, but now that our people are in power here we won't allow any separatism inside our republic."

Almost half the students attending public schools are minorities, yet fewer than 1 in 5 of their teachers is nonwhite.

New studies from the Center for American Progress and the National Education Association (NEA) are calling attention to this "diversity gap" at elementary and secondary schools in the United States. The groups want more to be done to help teachers more accurately mirror the students in their classrooms.

Students are a different story. In 1993, minority students made up 31 percent of the public school population; it was 41 percent in 2003.

The Center for American Progress' most recent statistics show 48 percent of the students in public schools are nonwhite — 23 percent Hispanic, 16 percent black and 5 percent Asian — and that percentage is expected to continue to increase.

"We project that this fall, for the first time in American history, the majority of public school students in America will be nonwhite," Education Secretary Arne Duncan said last week.

Hispanics have passed blacks as the largest minority group of teachers, just as there are more Hispanic students than African-Americans in the public school system. This tracks with the increases in the number of Hispanics in the United States, with Latinos the largest minority group in the country and the fastest-growing.

Jan Alderson, a science teacher at Shawnee Mission South High School in Overland Park, Kansas, saw the changes at her school.

"We have very few teachers of minority background yet we've gone to about 40 percent minority population," said Alderson, who was inducted into the National Teacher Hall of Fame this past week. "It's a beautiful blending, it's just teachers who don't have that cultural background, I think just that there are more issues."

WASHINGTON — One trained soldiers to use Stinger missiles to shoot down enemy jets and helicopters.

"I think we're about to enter a whole new phase in the next 12 months … 16 months probably on the outside," Hurley said. "There's going to be a whole new phase. It's just like when the iPhone came out and there was this mad gold rush. It's gonna be the same thing."

Other areas like gaming will also be affected, thanks to products like the Oculus Rift, a virtual reality headset that enables 3-D gaming.

JPMorgan analyst Brian Tunick calculated that between 2007 and 2013, both off-price chains and fast-fashion retailers — a category that includes names such as Forever 21, H&amp;M, Uniqlo and Zara that offer inexpensive fashion that is changed frequently — made significant gains.

Tunick's mid-May report to investors noted even before American Eagle's store closure program was revealed that Abercrombie had closed 260 locations since 2011 and Pacific Sun had closed 230 stores in that period. Aeropostale is expected to close up to 300 locations in the next few years, including a number of its P.S. from Aeropostale stores, he said.

![](//newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/20130829_TEENJOBS.jpg) WASHINGTON — For the fourth consecutive summer, teen employment has stayed anchored around record lows, prompting experts to fear that a generation of youth is likely to be economically stunted with lower earnings and opportunities in years ahead.

The trend is all the more striking given that the overall unemployment rate has steadily dropped, to 7.4 percent in August. And employers in recent months have been collectively adding almost 200,000 new jobs a month. It led to hopes that this would be the summer when teen employment improved.

"People entering into the labor force in their 20s, it looks like more and more now they're not going to have any work experience as teens. Labor force participation is as low as it's ever been," said Keith Hall, who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2008 to 2012.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20141211_TEENAGERS_CRIME.png" />PHILADELPHIA — A summer jobs program for teenagers appears to cut the rate of violent crime, according to a new study by a University of Pennsylvania researcher.

And not because the youths were too busy working to break the law. Those who were randomly chosen to get the eight-week positions were arrested for violent offenses 43 percent fewer times than their peers, and most of that difference occurred during the 13 months after the jobs were finished.

The 730 teens who were offered jobs were picked at random from among 1,634 applicants. Their number of arrests for violent crimes was slightly lower than that of the remaining 904 teens while the jobs lasted, but the difference did not become statistically significant until six months into the study — three months after the jobs were completed.

Together, the team reported Thursday that they uncovered an oddity: A break in genetic material that left the "head" of one gene fused to the "body" of another. That results in an abnormal protein that forms inside the tumors but not in normal liver tissue, suggesting it might fuel cancer growth, the researchers wrote. They've found the evidence in all 15 of the tumors tested so far.

"Lots of airports around the U.S. depend on visible technology" or video cameras, said Roy Malmberg of FLIR, an Oregon company that makes night-viewing thermal imaging and radar detection systems that some airports have adopted.

With little to look forward to, the 18-year-old began to pursue short-term successes, getting involved in drugs and criminal activity. He prayed that he'd live to see 21.

"We all like to think we can outsmart the system, but it never works out that way," Henderson said. "We all end up in jail or dead. I always thought it would be much better to be dead than in jail."

Henderson's choices shouldn't come as a surprise, according to a recent University of Texas at Dallas study that found that teens who believe they will die young are more likely to commit crimes — and more serious ones at that.

The study, released last month, asked more than 1,300 serious juvenile offenders in Arizona and Pennsylvania one question: How long do you think you'll live? Their answers ranged from 16 to 200 years old. Researchers then checked in periodically with them over a period of seven years and asked about subsequent criminal activity.

For a long time, Henderson felt he had neither. All the adults he knew had no college education, and many dealt drugs to make money, he said. Earlier this year, Henderson was arrested for distribution of marijuana — a felony charge that's pending.

"I basically had no visible hope," he said. "I thought to myself, this is the lifestyle that everybody before me shows, this is the lifestyle that everyone around me is doing and this is the lifestyle I have to choose.

When Brookfield (Wis.) Central High School student Chloe Olier started driving earlier this summer, her parents Dany and Virginie installed a DriveCam, a monitoring device that records video whenever she makes driving mistakes.

She wasn't pleased. It emails missteps to her parents, who review the footage online with her.

Chloe now says she'd recommend it to her friends because it has made her a better driver. The machine, obtained for free from the family's auto insurer, American Family Insurance, recorded her 23 times the first week. Now, she only makes sporadic mistakes.

"It's nice because it tells me what I'm doing wrong so I don't do it anymore," she said. It's only intrusive while it's recording, "so in order not to feel that way, I drive well."

Research shows that electronic monitoring devices can reduce risky driving behavior by teenagers, and a growing number of insurance companies and auto manufacturers are offering new products, but they are slow to catch on.

To see when and where teens were (and weren't) getting exercise throughout the day, researchers outfitted 549 volunteers from Seattle and Baltimore with GPS monitors and activity trackers. The trackers recorded their location and their movement once every 30 seconds for about a week.

The volunteers — all between the ages of 12 and 16 — spent more of their waking hours at school than anywhere else, according to the GPS readings. On average, they passed 42 percent of their time at school, 28 percent at home, 13 percent in their neighborhoods, 4 percent near their schools and the rest elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the activity trackers revealed that the students averaged 39.4 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity over the course of each day. On school days, 55 percent of those minutes were tallied at school. When weekends were factored in, 42 percent of the week's total exercise occurred on school grounds. The amount of time teens spent exercising was more than 25 percent higher on school days than on weekend days, according to the study.

Her options seemed limited: go back, pick it up and be late for the concert; pay a $100 minimum fee to get a new prescription at a walk-in clinic; "or go without the inhaler and hope that they had a rescue machine at the festival on the off chance I had an asthma attack, which, of course, wasn't a very inviting prospect," Cunningham said.

BREEZY POINT, N.Y. — The sky is cloudless and blue in this coastal community of bungalows by the sea. But Stephanie Abrams has disaster on her mind.

Abrams has come to this town, which was walloped by Hurricane Sandy last year, to warn viewers of potential dangers in the months ahead.

Helped by a steady string of blizzards, tropical storms, hurricanes and tornadoes, the cable channel has increased its revenue while some other media outlets have struggled. Even when the weather in most of the country is mild, the channel's round-the-clock coverage tends to be heavy with big graphics, capital letters and warnings of what bad weather could be unfolding somewhere, soon, in the United States. Such weather data are now expanding to the Web and cellphones, part of the reason the company changed its name to the Weather Co. from the Weather Channel late last year.

Still, big storms are catnip for advertisers. The fourth quarter of the 2012, which included Sandy and some other big winter storms, was a blockbuster, said Curt Hecht, chief global revenue officer for Weather Co., which is privately held. Weather.com had more page views on the first day of Sandy than NBC.com had for all of the London Olympics, he said.

DUNHUANG, China — Hewn by hand out of a cliff face in the Gobi Desert starting about 1,700 years ago, China's most spectacular cache of Buddhist caves has endured countless assaults over the centuries — earthquakes and floods, plundering foreign explorers and even Russian soldiers, who billeted here in the 1920s on the run from the Bolsheviks and filled their beautifully painted quarters with smoky cooking fires.

Toting bulky backpacks, exhaling humid breath and posing other problems, these unwitting vectors of decay are arriving in ever-greater numbers each year and threatening to undermine decades of painstaking conservation efforts. Mogao, which received 26,000 visitors in 1979, its first year open to the public, is bracing for up to 1 million this year.

Scientists with the Mexican government announced Wednesday the discovery of three new chambers at the end of a tunnel under the ancient city of Teotihuacan. The tunnel was discovered in 2003 beneath the popular tourist destination just outside today's Mexico City and is among the most important finds in the lost city's history.

WASHINGTON — Islamic State militants and their followers have discovered an unnerving new communications and recruiting tool that has stymied U.S. counter-terrorism agencies: instant-messaging apps on smartphones that encrypt the texts or destroy them almost immediately.

DETROIT — Electric car maker Tesla Motors is leapfrogging competitors with a new autopilot system that lets cars change lanes by themselves.

But analysts say the lane-changing feature is an industry first. Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the system is also unique because it will constantly collect data from actual drivers and improve itself. The system will note, for example, how quickly drivers can safely navigate a particular bend in the road or where stop signs are located.

Tesla Motors Inc. already claims to have the electric car that can go the longest between charges, and now it is claiming another automotive superlative — the safest car on the road.

The Palo Alto, Calif., electric car company said that during recent testing by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "the Model S set a new record for the lowest likelihood of injury to occupants."

Officials at the federal agency didn't return calls seeking confirmation of Tesla's claim. But the sporty Model S did win a five-star safety rating from the NHTSA, a ranking reserved for the vehicles that do best in the agency's crash-test program.

This growing demand for meat necessitates a "protein transition," according to bioethicist Cor van der Weele and bioprocessing engineer Johannes Tramper. This transition will probably involve substituting some vegetable products for meat, keeping fewer animals on factory farms and possibly eating insects.

Five million public school students in Texas will begin using new social studies textbooks this fall based on state academic standards that barely address racial segregation. The state's guidelines for teaching American history also do not mention the Ku Klux Klan or Jim Crow laws.

"It's the obvious question, it seems to me. Not only are we worried about the flags and statues and all that, but what the hell are kids learning?" said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network, a left-leaning advocacy organization that has been critical of the state's academic standards in social studies.

Rod Paige, a Republican who served as education secretary under President George W. Bush, was among those who criticized the Texas board for minimizing difficult parts of the nation's past.

"I'm of the view that the history of slavery and civil rights are dominant elements of our history and have shaped who we are today," Paige told the board at the time, according to the Texas Tribune. "We may not like our history, but it's history."

Historians acknowledge that disagreements over states' rights played a role in the Civil War. But the states' rights issue was inseparable from slavery, they say: The right that states in the South were seeking to protect, after all, was the right to buy and sell people.

Mothers of teenagers are used to getting frustrating text messages, but the one that Roni Dean-Burren received from her 15-year-old son last week wasn't about alcohol, dating or money for the movies.

Southern Methodist University history professor Edward Countryman told NPR in an interview this summer that including no more than a cursory nod to race and slavery in textbooks does students a disservice.

"I was already frustrated at how addicted to texting my daughter was," said the San Clemente, California, father of four, who at the time had just learned a grim statistic: More than 7,000 Americans had died from texting and driving the previous year.

Instead of just signing the requisite slip of paper, Irving took a more proactive tack. He began work on a smartphone app to help solve the problem of texting behind the wheel. That app has since grown into a nonprofit dedicated to combating a relentless scourge. Since 2009, when Irving was first inspired to develop Text Kills (textkills.com), texting and driving has surpassed drinking and driving as the No. 1 killer of U.S. teens.

"At the time, we were just a bunch of engineers and [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) living day to day," said Irving, who had been invited to Washington, D.C., to showcase the Text Kills app at a U.S. Department of Transportation event. Lacking the money to fly, Irving and his four co-developers at Monster Arts in San Clemente took turns driving Irving's RV, visiting college campuses along the way and proselytizing the ills of texting behind the wheel with a one-page fact sheet.

"We educated ourselves and hit the road," said Irving, whose first stop was the University of Denver in Colorado; 1,200 students showed up.

In the three years since, he said, "We've heard thousands of stories from kids and parents who have lost loved ones."

Text Kills isn't just for teens. Recognizing that 10 percent of teens' parents admit to having extended, multi-message text conversations while driving, according to a study published in November by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Text Kills also visits car shows and safety fairs, and participates in corporate events for companies such as Cola-Cola and at Volkswagen dealerships, as it did on a recent weekend at Capistrano Volkswagen in San Juan Capistrano.
Gatherings of five or more people have been prohibited in Thailand since May 22, when then-army chief Prayuth Chan-Ocha deposed elected leaders in a move he said was necessary to restore order after months of disruptive political protests.

Frustrated by their inability to assemble and air their demands that democracy be restored, the mainly youthful opponents of the ruling junta have taken to symbolic expressions, like reading George Orwell's totalitarian narrative "1984" in public or raising the salute against repression borrowed from fiction to protest reality.

NEW YORK (AP) — It's a turkey. It's a menorah. It's Thanksgivukkah!

An extremely rare convergence this year of Thanksgiving and the start of Hanukkah has created a frenzy of Talmudic proportions.

There's the number crunching: The last time it happened was 1888, or at least the last time since Thanksgiving was declared a federal holiday by President Lincoln, and the next time may have Jews lighting their candles from spaceships 79,043 years from now, by one calculation.

There's the commerce: A 9-year-old New York boy invented the "menurkey" and raised more than $48,000 on Kickstarter for his already trademarked, Turkey-shaped menorah. Woodstock-inspired T-shirts have a turkey perched on the neck of a guitar and implore "8 Days of Light, Liberty &amp; Latkes." The creators nabbed the trademark to "Thanksgivukkah."

Margaret Thatcher, Great Britain's first female Prime Minister and a powerful political figure, died on April 8 after suffering a stroke. She was 87.

In economic policy, Thatcher believed in competition as a way of making Britain more efficient and richer. In order to increase economic competition, Thatcher took harsh measures against what she considered to be underperforming industries, like coal mining, but encouraged the growth of industries perceived to be more profitable, like banking.

Lim showed the famous photo of the "Tank Man" — the lone, anonymous figure who stood up and stopped an advancing line of tanks after the killings. Then she described an experiment: she showed the photo to 100 Chinese students at four top universities. Only 15 could identify the picture, and several were nervous to have that knowledge.

As a young woman, she dressed in fur-trimmed robes with fat ropes of coral beads strung around her neck. She lived in an adobe castle on the edge of the Tibetan plateau with a reception room large enough to accommodate the thousand Buddhist monks who once paid tribute to her father.

Forget climbing Mount Everest — for most humans, just eking out a living on the harsh Tibetan plateau is challenge enough. But Tibetan people have thrived there for thousands of years, and a new study says it's thanks to a genetic adaptation they inherited from an ancient human relative.

JINTANG, China — In a lifetime of herding, Liu Xiangqing had never seen cows so scared.

Normally, at 6 a.m., they would be gathered together, contentedly chewing and grazing in the dawn light. But this June morning, they were scattered through the pine scrub, pacing with agitation, their ears alert. Liu took a quick head count and realized one was missing, a 2-year-old bull.

Although they weigh as much as 675 pounds, Siberian tigers are elusive creatures that slink into the forest when humans approach. Villagers learn that a tiger has been on the prowl when they spot paw prints (or pug marks, as they are known) the diameter of melons. Or, as is happening more frequently in China, they discover that livestock is missing or mauled.

Four cows were killed in five days in May in another village near the border. One of the largest of Liu's cattle, a 1,300-pound bull, lost his tail to a tiger but stayed alive by fighting back.

Li credits campaigns to restore the degraded forests in China and Russia. The latter began tiger-protection efforts in the 1940s and has the largest population of Siberian tigers, between 400 and 900, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

But in recent years, China has caught up and might even be moving ahead in creating tiger-friendly habitat, Li said.

"Russia has fewer people than China, so it is a better place for tigers. But they are doing a lot of logging and burning off of agriculture fields after harvest, and the tigers don't like that," said Li, a native of Hunchun, the largest city in the region. "It is not hard for a tiger to jump over the barbed-wire fences at the border and come to China."

Although Chinese still buy illegal body parts of tigers — poached in India or killed in captivity — for traditional medicine, the wild tigers have not been hunted in China since the 1950s, Li said. In fact, hunting of all animals except rats is banned in China.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/Time_Person_Of_The_Ye_Edit.jpg" />NEW YORK — Time magazine selected Pope Francis as its Person of the Year on Wednesday, saying the Catholic Church's new leader has changed the perception of the 2,000-year-old institution in an extraordinary way in a short time.

The [pope](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=pope) beat out NSA leaker Edward Snowden for the distinction, which the newsmagazine has been giving each year since 1927.

But Hawking may be on the wrong side of history. Recent experiments offer tentative support for time travel's feasibility—at least from a mathematical perspective. The study cuts to the core of our understanding of the universe, and the resolution of the possibility of time travel, far from being a topic worthy only of science fiction, would have profound implications for fundamental physics as well as for practical applications such as quantum cryptography and computing.

The source of time travel speculation lies in the fact that our best physical theories seem to contain no prohibitions on traveling backward through time. The feat should be possible based on Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity as the warping of spacetime by energy and matter. An extremely powerful gravitational field, such as that produced by a spinning black hole, could in principle profoundly warp the fabric of existence so that spacetime bends back on itself. This would create a "closed timelike curve," or CTC, a loop that could be traversed to travel back in time.

Lloyd, though, readily admits the speculative nature of CTCs. "I have no idea which model is really right. Probably both of them are wrong," he says. Of course, he adds, the other possibility is that Hawking is correct, "that CTCs simply don't and cannot exist." Time-travel party planners should save the champagne for themselves—their hoped-for future guests seem unlikely to arrive.
RICHMOND, Va. — You may have to be at least 18 to buy cigarettes in the United States, but children as young as 7 are working long hours in fields harvesting nicotine- and pesticide-laced tobacco leaves under sometimes hazardous and sweltering conditions, according to a report released Wednesday by an international rights group.

With tornadoes, advance warning comes down to minutes. In Moore, Oklahoma, on May 20, it was 16 minutes.

In Newcastle, to the southwest, nearest where the deadly mile-wide tornado that killed 24 people first formed, it was five minutes.

Tornadoes used to strike without any warning. Since the 1970s, meteorologists have worked to bring the average warning time up to 13 minutes. A combination of weather balloons, radar and on-the-ground observations form the core of today's forecasting technology.

Now scientists have a new goal: extending the warning time from minutes to hours by sending unmanned aircraft — [drones](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=drone) — into a brewing storm. Pulling that off would require not only technological expertise, but also flexibility in government rules that block most such flights.

The key word is "if." Under current Federal Aviation Administration regulations, it is illegal to operate unmanned aircraft in the national airspace.

Public agencies, including universities, can apply for a special certificate to fly the aircraft. But from there, the FAA requires 48 hours advance notice before actually going up, and it insists that the pilot keep the aircraft in his or her line of sight at all times — impossible when it comes to rain-shrouded tornadoes that form within hours.

Although careful not to criticize the FAA, noting the administration's emphasis on safety, researchers voiced frustration about the slow pace of changes to regulations that have limited the use of technology ready for deployment.

Now he's obsessed with preventing such a scenario.

Erwin runs an architecture company in Springfield, Missouri, that designs and builds tornado safe rooms in schools - structures with walls and ceilings so strong, and footings so deep, they should withstand winds stronger than those that destroyed schools in Oklahoma City this week.

In three years, Erwin's company, Paragon Architecture, has worked on 37 tornado safe rooms at schools and community centers across Missouri. The company also has an office in Joplin, Missouri, where it worked with the school district to apply for grants to build 16 safe rooms in schools across the city.

Their uncannily accurate predictions — combined with television and radio warnings, text-message alerts and storm sirens — almost certainly saved lives as rare late-season tornadoes dropped out of a dark autumn sky. Although the storms howled through 12 states and flattened entire neighborhoods within a matter of minutes, the number of dead stood at just eight.

By Monday, another, more prosaic reason for the relatively low death toll also came to light: In the hardest-hit town, most families were in church.

"I don't think we had one church damaged," said Gary Manier, mayor of Washington, Ill., a community of 16,000 about 140 miles southwest of Chicago.

On Monday, he was surveying the damage on crutches after suffering a leg injury when the wind knocked his home off its foundation.

That's when information from weather stations, weather balloons, satellite imagery and radar suggested there was more than enough moisture — fuel for storms — making its way northeast from the Gulf of Mexico.

Despite Sunday's destruction, 2013 has been a relatively mild year for twisters in the U.S., with the number of twisters running at or near record lows.

So far this year, there have been 886 preliminary reports of tornadoes, compared with about 1,400 preliminary reports usually sent to the weather service by mid-November.

An outbreak like the one that developed Sunday usually happens about once every seven to 10 years, according to tornado experts at the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla.

In December, Royal Thai Customs officials confiscated a suitcase containing 62 rare radiated tortoises at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi International Airport.

The same could be said for most of the cold-blooded animals at the conservancy, a secret compound of paddocks and aquariums protected by surveillance cameras and electric wire in the foothills of Los Padres National Forest.

WASHINGTON — Senate investigators delivered a damning indictment of CIA interrogations Tuesday, accusing the spy agency of inflicting suffering on prisoners beyond its legal limits and peddling unsubstantiated stories that the harsh questioning saved American lives.

President George W. Bush approved the program through a covert finding in 2002, but he wasn't briefed by the CIA about the details until 2006. At that time Bush expressed discomfort with the "image of a detainee, chained to the ceiling, clothed in a diaper and forced to go to the bathroom on himself."

Zubaydah was held in a secret facility in Thailand, called "detention Site Green" in the report. Early on, with CIA officials believing he had information on an imminent plot, Zubaydah was left isolated for 47 days without questioning, the report says. Later, he was subjected to the panoply of techniques. He later suffered mental problems.

With its provocative detail splashed across the TV screens, front pages and websites of our leading media, the report will undoubtedly endanger American lives by giving extremists one more rallying cry to attack U.S. interests, strengthening their recruiting efforts, and forcing other governments and intelligence services to show that they're keeping their distance from Uncle Sam.

To be clear, the report was revealing only in its raw detail of CIA activities against particular detainees, not in the broad subject matter. We've known for many years that the CIA used unsavory methods.

Instead of dealing with the Afghanistan government to gain custody of those responsible for the attacks in New York, we took over the country. Now we are trying to extricate ourselves from Afghanistan, but without correcting the instability that let al-Qaida operate.

Back in 1950, Eiji Toyoda visited a Ford plant to learn how Americans made cars. The visit by a member of Japan's foremost manufacturing family changed the way Toyota Motor Corp. produced cars, altering the global auto industry.

Toyoda, who is credited with developing the car company's efficient, low-defect manufacturing processes and who helped spearhead Toyota's aggressive push into the U.S. auto market, died Tuesday. He was 100.

"Clearly Eiji was the person that laid the groundwork for what Toyota is today," said David Cole, former chairman of the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research. "He was a real visionary and inspirational leader who understood what it would take to make Toyota a successful company."

Toyoda, a cousin of the Japanese automaker's founder Kiichiro Toyoda, died of heart failure at Toyota Memorial Hospital in Toyota city, central Japan. The family used the Toyota name for the business because they believed it sounded better and because it was the winning entry in a 1936 logo competition.

Born Sept. 12, 1913, in Nagoya City, Toyoda graduated from the University of Tokyo with a degree in mechanical engineering in 1936. He joined Toyoda Automatic Loom Works Ltd. that same year. About a year later he moved to the company's newly established automotive subsidiary.

Having grown up at the textile mill built by his father, Heichachi Toyoda, and uncle Sakichi Toyoda, Eiji Toyoda loved machines.

"So from my childhood, machines and business were always there right in front of me," he said in a Time magazine interview in 1999. "I probably developed an understanding of both."

Toyoda, with the advice of production specialist Taiichi Ohno, changed Toyota's manufacturing approach. They focused on making cars in small batches, receiving just enough parts at the factory to complete a production run efficiently.

This reduced the need to stockpile supplies at the factory and was the start of the "kanban" or "just in time" delivery concept, which has become the standard production method in the global auto industry.

The company believes it can use its manufacturing expertise to become as crucial in a field it calls "partner robots" as it is to auto-making. Robotics engineers at Toyota currently number only 150 out of a worldwide staff of 300,000, but the company is plowing money into research and development.

Toyota last month announced a $1 billion investment in a research company headed by robotics expert Gill Pratt in Silicon Valley to develop artificial intelligence and robotics. It is already working with Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on robotics.

"We are preparing for a future in which people may not be able to drive cars, or they may need artificial intelligence to support them to drive, and once they get off their cars they may need help from partner robots," said Akifumi Tamaoki, general manager of Toyota's partner robot division.

The Japanese government is banking on robotics as a growth industry in a society that's aging at a faster pace than any other industrialized nation. Other companies have jumped in, including Internet company Softbank Corp., which is selling a humanoid that carries on simple conversations.

Surging demand for all things "Frozen" helped the toy industry achieve a rare gain last year. Toys related to the blockbuster about a princess who sets off to find her sister with icy powers were popular. In fact, "Frozen" was the top toy brand last year, reaching $531 million in sales, according to NPD.

The Hollywood infatuation is expected to continue with the release of the "Star Wars" movie on Dec. 18. Hundreds of products, from puzzles to action figures related to "Star Wars" are expected to exceed Frozen's success.

Marty Brochstein, who is with the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers Association, says the $199.99 LightSaber from Hasbro, which features motion sensor-controlled sound effects, already are on backorder. He says "Star Wars" appeals to both kids and adults.

Hasbro's StarLily My Magical Unicorn, for example, responds to voice and touch with more than 100 sound and motion combinations. Mattel, the nation's largest toy company, also is hoping technology will help it reverse years of slumping sales.

LOS ANGELES — By any measure, the Pacific Crest Trail is a beastly thing, an angry anaconda that slithers up the entire length of California and all the way to Canada, some 2,650 rugged miles. That's approximately 6 million steps — some of them glorious, many of them merciless.

Near the southern trail head, Sandy and Barney Mann open their five-bedroom San Diego home to up to 60 hikers a night. They even pick them up from the airport and ferry them and their gear to the starting point an hour east.

Up the trail, in Agua Dulce, Donna and Jeff Saufley not only provide a night's rest to more than 1,000 hikers a season, they offer food and shelter to their dogs, horses and the occasional llama.

East of the Bay Area, Hank Magnuski functions as a sort of outdoors concierge, erecting a pop-up cafe to provide hot coffee and fresh fruit topped with whipped cream to hikers coming off a particularly grueling 300-mile stretch.

They are all part of a small network of outdoor Samaritans called "trail angels."

NEW YORK  — A New York City commuter train rounding a riverside curve derailed Sunday, killing four people and injuring more than 60 in a crash that threw passengers from the toppling cars and left a snaking chain of twisted wreckage just inches from the water.

Nearby residents awoke to a building-shaking boom. Angel Gonzalez was in bed in his high-rise apartment overlooking the rail curve when he heard the roar.

Three men and one woman were killed, the MTA said. Three of the dead were found outside the train, and one was found inside, authorities said. The victims' names had not yet been released.

But the state is in the middle of trying to build its own bullet train, a $68 billion project that has grown in cost and fallen behind schedule. Musk, 42, contends his system is superior — and cheaper — and that he wanted to get it into the public discussion before the state wastes more time and money on what he sees as a failed system.

"How could it be that the home of Silicon Valley and JPL ... would build a bullet train that is both one of the most expensive per mile and one of the slowest in the world?" he said. "It would be great to have an alternative to flying or driving, but obviously only if it is actually better than flying or driving."

Musk said the answer is the Hyperloop. He might first build a prototype to prove the concept, but the plan has been published as an open-source document — ready for anyone to pick up the idea and improve it.

The sandy-haired South African emigrant first made millions when he [co-founded](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) and sold online payment business PayPal to EBay Inc. for $1.5 billion. Armed with his personal fortune and a Rolodex full of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, Musk started the rocket company SpaceX, or Space Exploration Technologies Corp., and co-founded electric car giant Tesla Motors Inc. in Palo Alto.

Now he's declared the dawning of a fifth mode of transportation after rail, road, water and air. This one operates somewhat like pneumatic delivery systems that have been used at neighborhood banks, sending packages through pressurized air tubes.

The California bullet train authority took Musk's criticism in stride, saying that such new technology is worth considering. But to draw a distinction between the state's project and Musk's vision, authority Chairman Dan Richard added, "If and when Mr. Musk pursues his Hyperloop technology, we'll be happy to share our experience about what it really takes to build a project in California, across seismic zones, minimizing impacts on farms, businesses and communities and protecting sensitive environmental areas and species."

The plan already has drawn criticism targeting its novel design, lack of details and absence of outside review. Bill Ibbs, a University of California, Berkeley civil engineering professor, said Musk's idea comes up short on the economics.

"There's a reference to 7.4 million riders per year on this system, but there's no background, no explanation of where he comes up with that figure," he said.

The California bullet train is a politically engineered system, with a route that doglegs to medium-size cities on its way to San Francisco. But the circuitous path added to the cost and resulted in slower projected trip times.

It's unclear whether Musk could get the support needed to build a system that would bypass many of the cities on the bullet train's planned path. Transportation experts warned that Musk's proposal, even if technically sound, would still have to operate in California's byzantine political system.

The team excavated the 1.5-inch crown of a T. rex tooth lodged between the fused vertebrae of a hadrosaur, a plant-eating duck-billed dinosaur. The vertebrae had grown around the chisel-shaped tooth — indicating that the hadrosaur was alive when it was attacked, according to a report published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

"It was a very exciting moment," said Burnham.

NEW YORK — The college classroom is properly the site of serious discussion of potentially traumatic topics. "Trigger warnings" don't interfere with that process — in fact, they enhance it.

Trigger warnings' origins lie in the wilds of the Internet, where they arose as a way to alert readers about content that might be traumatic.

Their premise is that a rape survivor, for instance, might legitimately prefer to have some warning before encountering a graphic description of sexual assault. Though not entirely uncontroversial, trigger warnings generally don't spark much rancor in online spaces. Some writers use them, most don't, but they usually pass without much comment either way.

Earlier this year, though, when college students started pushing for the use of trigger warnings in classes, their demand provoked a massive, vitriolic and overwhelmingly negative response.

Unlike most faculty, though, I found the idea intriguing. As a historian I discuss some very dark and difficult material in class, and as a professor I think it's important to give students a clear sense of their rights and responsibilities.

In my content note I warn students that some of them may find some of the material we cover disturbing.

I don't provide examples in the syllabus itself, but I do when we review it together. I let students know that I'm open to discussing their personal reactions to historical topics during class or in my office hours, tell them that they're free to step outside briefly if they find any content overwhelming, and encourage them to talk to me privately if they have any specific concerns.

While trigger warning opponents rejected my approach as insubstantial, even meaningless, in other words, supporters cheered it as a significant and potentially transformative pedagogical tool.

### CON: "Trigger warnings" shackle the free flow of ideas vital to higher education

In the name of sensitivity, the movement undermines the very equal respect it ostensibly supports, while also fostering the mentality of in loco parentis that universities properly abandoned decades ago.



Packer's reports led the Tanzanian government to cut hunting quotas and introduce a law against shooting immature males, but he said the law has rarely been enforced because of widespread corruption in the industry.

"We see that across Africa, local communities receive minimal benefit from trophy hunting, particularly when we consider the vast areas of land that hunting concessions occupy," the report said.
For millions of years the biggest dinosaurs on the planet steered clear of the tropics, and now scientists think they know why.

Late in the Triassic, some 212 million years ago, the massive long-necked plant eaters known as sauropodomorphs were commonly found in northern latitudes (present-day Europe) and southern latitudes (present-day Argentina), but according to the fossil record, they were completely absent in the tropics.

In a paper published this week in PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), a broad group of researchers concluded that high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels during the Triassic Period led to a volatile and inhospitable environment in the low latitudes on the great continent of Pangaea.

From near extinction to stunning recovery, its comeback is a rare win for threatened and [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+species), a decades-long odyssey of biological risk and scientific discovery made possible by the uncommon commitment of a fisheries biologist laboring in one of the most remote corners of the West.

It's an increasingly common form of commercial identity theft that has allowed con men to make off each year with millions of dollars in merchandise, often food and beverages. And experts say the practice is growing so rapidly that it will soon become the most common way to steal freight.

A generation ago, thieves simply stole loaded trucks out of parking lots. But the industry's widening use of GPS devices, high-tech locks and other advanced security measures have pushed criminals to adopt new hoaxes.

Helping to drive the scams, experts say, is the Internet, which offers thieves easy access to vast amounts of information about the trucking industry. Online databases allow con men to assume the identities of legitimate freight haulers and to trawl for specific commodities they want to steal.

WASHINGTON — As proof that he can successfully and humanely deport the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally, Republican presidential contender Donald Trump often touts the efforts of the Eisenhower administration in the 1950s.

MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — Donald Trump on Tuesday stood by his call to block all Muslims from entering the United States, even as the idea was widely condemned as un-American by rival Republican presidential candidates, party leaders and others.

Turkeys are fitness nuts, grazing for seeds, acorns, mushrooms and occasional frog legs and have the ropy muscles to hit the afterburners if bothered. They can run 20 miles per hour and fly 55 mph.

If you heard that a turkey is so stupid it will look up at rain and drown, that's fiction. Don't even doubt their laser eyes and sonar-grade ears.

Hunters know if they twitch a muscle, a gobbler will see it from a mile away and then be miles away. Their ability to pinpoint the direction and distance of sound in heavy woods is astounding, say biologists.

If you are what you eat, then turkeys taste like nature. "With a lot less fat" than a store-bought roaster, said Tom Hughes of the National Wild Turkey Federation.

If eagles are what they wolf down at landfills, like the rotting kielbasa they can spot with their vaunted telescopic vision, then yuck.

What they may do best is a pretty weird face on the back of a $1 bill.

"It seriously damaged my child's psychology," said Guvener, who heads the Protestant Church in Diyarbakir. He accuses the school of deliberately forcing religious education on students — a claim the teachers union denied.

"It is not possible to control the youth of today," Guclu said. "If they spend three or five hours at school, they spend eight or 10 hours in front of the Internet, the social media or television. For every few hours of religious education, they spend hundreds of hours elsewhere, being bombarded by other things."
At a graveyard in the western town of Soma, where coal mining has been the main industry for decades, women wailed loudly in an improvised display of mourning. They swayed and sang songs about their relatives as the bodies were taken from coffins and lowered into their graves. Pictures of the lost relatives were pinned onto their clothing.

The death toll made it Turkey's worst mining accident, topping a 1992 gas explosion that killed 263 workers near the Black Sea port of Zonguldak.

Mining accidents are common in Turkey, which is plagued by poor safety conditions. Erdogan promised that Tuesday's tragedy would be investigated to its "smallest detail" and that "no negligence will be ignored." Hurriyet newspaper reported that a team of 15 prosecutors has been assigned to investigate the accident.

Turkey's Labor and Social Security Ministry said the mine had been inspected five times since 2012, most recently in March, when no safety violations were detected. But the country's main opposition party said Erdogan's ruling party had recently voted down a proposal to hold a parliamentary inquiry into a series of small-scale accidents at the mines around Soma.
"We don't expect that these turtles are coming to the magnetic signature regardless of what else is going on," he said. "If a condo is built there, they will usually decide to go nest somewhere else."

Welcome to the mysterious world of sea turtles, which spend much of their life far from Florida's beaches encountering fishing boats, oil spills, plastic trash and any number of other perils.

Nesting by loggerhead, green and leatherback turtles has been trending up in numbers for nearly the past five years along the state's coast. But there have been significant dips and climbs in their nest counts.

The turtle kings of Florida's coastline, loggerheads, which have huge heads relative to their 3 1/2-foot shells, deposited eggs in 46,885 nests this year.

That count was from the state's "index" locations at 26 beaches, where nest monitoring has been done by researchers using the same methods since 1989.

"Once we got to 1978, restaurateurs had to get all the green-turtle steaks out of their freezers, and green-turtle soup disappeared from menus, and most people stopped killing them, and guess what, they came back," Ehrhart said.

Laws protecting turtles and their nests have been accompanied by progressively better attitudes among communities in dimming their seashore lights. Green turtles, in particular, are spooked by artificial lighting, scientists say.

Mansfield said green turtles may have once had a large presence on Florida shores and are now reclaiming long-lost turf.

"That has sort of spilled over to Florida," he said. "I don't think anybody knows the reason for this. Between the time they hit the water as hatchlings and the time they come back 800- or 900-pound adults, there are hardly any records of them appearing anywhere."

In the midst of the cold digital landscape, so often flooded with hateful comments and cutting insults, there now exists a little blue-faced robot who wants you to know that you are "more amazing than fresh towels from the dryer."

Meet the Twitter "@TheNiceBot," a cheerful spambot that blurts a small dose of positivism into the Twitterverse every 36 seconds by matching a randomly generated compliment with a randomly selected Twitter user. Born after its creators, anti-bullying nonprofit organization Champions Against Bullying and the Deutsch advertising agency, learned that a cruel or insulting comment is posted to Twitter every 60 seconds (only every 60 seconds?), it sends out messages that overflow with all the cheesy sweetness of an elementary school Valentine's Day card:

"It's happened this year and this recruiting class," Duke coach David Cutcliffe said. "It's just insane what some of them think's OK. When I know it's them and I read it and I see some of the things out there, if I'm on the road, I'll call a coach — let his high school coach know we're no longer interested. And I'll call back to (Duke director of football relations) Kent McLoud or the people in the office and say I want him dropped off the database. No more mail. Nothing."

It's the underdog of U.S. currency, the greenback more likely to be found tucked inside a dresser drawer or wallet than a cash register.

Now, it's about to get its time in the limelight, thanks to a Delray Beach, Fla., man who has always loved it. John Bennardo is crisscrossing the country to film a documentary that'll tell the story of the two and its "magic."

The quirky bill with Thomas Jefferson on the front and the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the back is more than just a collector's item. It's a regular at some strip clubs, a piece of a longtime Clemson University tradition and a tool used to show a group's economic influence.

While many save $2 bills, others make a point to spend them — just to see what happens next.

Bennardo was always one to save them. By last summer, the Immagine Productions owner and Lynn University professor of film and television editing had 11 of them in a desk drawer, sitting inside an old checkbook box, never to be spent. It got him thinking: What is it about the two?

Amy Byer Shainman, a Jupiter, Fla., resident and breast cancer advocate who is also passionate about the bill, joined on as executive producer. She said she has kept a two her high school crush gave her for more than 25 years without knowing why.

Beyond that, he has traveled to several states — including Texas, New York, Michigan and Oregon — and interviewed about 50 people in all. Along the way, Bennardo has discovered a whole society of others who share his and Byer Shainman's enthusiasm for the offbeat bill.

Among them is Heather McCabe, a copywriter from Brooklyn, N.Y., who requests $2 bills from her bank and spends them at local businesses in hopes of seeing the currency catch on. She chronicles the reactions she gets on her blog, Two Buckaroo.

McCabe, 39, started spending twos about 15 years ago because she liked the added interaction with people behind the counter.

Officials with the National Rifle Association say recent rallies at fast-food restaurants and home-improvement stores are "downright weird and certainly not a practical way to go normally about your business while being prepared to defend yourself."

While the group applauds Texas for a "robust gun culture," leaders of the group in a statement chastise "a small number (who) have recently crossed the line from enthusiasm to downright foolishness."

Open Carry Tarrant County also made national headlines after a misunderstanding at a Jack in the Box in Fort Worth prompted a 911 call expressing concerns about a group of men walking around with long-barreled guns.

Another demonstration at a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Dallas gained attention when managers asked customers to "not bring guns into our restaurants, unless they are authorized law enforcement personnel."

As a result of the national attention, some leaders in the open-carry movement recently sent out a letter calling on supporters to curb efforts to carry long guns into Texas businesses.

"We ask that members take a step back and make an objective assessment of what we are trying to accomplish and help us get open carry passed for everyone," according to the letter, jointly sent by Come and Take It Texas, Texas Carry, Gun Rights Across America and Open Carry Texas.

Forget the big yellow bus or even mom's taxi. This fall, more and more kids will be heading back to school via Uber and other ride-hailing options.

From car pools to practices, a growing number of families are relying on the services to schlep kids to and from school, after-school activities and other destinations. Demand is strong enough that several startups have launched, backed by millions in venture capital, specifically to meet the market for transporting children.

Whether the "can you pick me up" call will be fully replaced by an app remains to be seen.

"We do not allow unaccompanied minors on the Lyft platform, per our terms of service," said Katie Dally, Lyft spokeswoman. Uber spokeswoman Brooke Anderson declined to comment on the practice.

The nascent ride-hailing industry, which is dominated by private companies Uber and Lyft, has grown exponentially over the past few years on a network of private drivers as an urban alternative to taxis and public transportation.

Founded in 2009, market leader Uber is valued at more than $50 billion after closing its latest round of funding, according to a report last month in the Wall Street Journal. Numerous reports indicate that the San Francisco, California-based company is bleeding red ink as it pushes to rapidly expand.

Uber has introduced uberFAMILY — a $10 upcharge for a car that arrives with a child's car seat — in New York City and Washington, D.C., and is "exploring the possibility" of launching the service in Chicago, Illinois, according to Anderson. The service is not designed for children to travel alone.

The artwork was a sepia-toned collage and a self-portrait of sorts, showing eight people staring at the interior of Ackerman Union, their faces and hair made up of small images of famous African-Americans.

After graduating in 1974, Singleton took a job on campus with UCLA Extension and over the years occasionally stopped at the mural to look at the artwork and think about her classmates.

Then one day in 1992, she saw the mural was gone. A beige wall stood in its place.

"I was devastated," said Singleton, who was a 37-year-old mother when she helped create the mural in 1970.

KIEV, Ukraine — Understanding the depths of the crisis Ukraine faces today takes only a visit to historic St. Volodymyr's Cathedral.

For nations with robust military budgets, where national security is a high priority year after year, it seems odd that Ukraine's military has to go begging just to afford bullets during a time of crisis. But to those who study the military here, there's no surprise.

KIEV, Ukraine — The 3-month-old uprising against Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich flared to a deadly crescendo Tuesday with anti-government protesters setting fire to the ruling party headquarters and security forces storming their tent camp in what officials labeled "an anti-terror operation."

The Interior Ministry reported that at least nine people were killed: two police officers, an official of the ruling Party of Regions and six protesters. Opposition lawmaker Oleksandra Kuzhel said the death toll had grown to 15 after security forces moved against the encampment with stun grenades and water cannons. Other reports put the number as high as 19.

The paratroops had taken back control of the tower from gunmen two days before. It was a small skirmish in a conflict that has turned this town — and much of eastern Ukraine — into a battleground between pro-Russia separatists and the nation's struggling interim government.

Sunday brought a relative lull to the fighting in Slovyansk, though not to cities elsewhere in eastern Ukraine. A crowd of more than 2,000 pro-Russia separatists seized the military prosecutor's office in Donetsk, one of the last key official sites in the city still in the hands of the country's interim government.

COLUMBUS, Ohio — President Barack Obama is right to reject the request of Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko for military aid of the lethal type. Poroshenko wants weaponry to fight separatist elements in his country.



The United States should promote that process. There is every reason to believe that an acceptable arrangement can be achieved that will end the bloodshed in Ukraine.

The West Akron, Ohio, resident is a pysanky artist, who decorates Easter eggs using methods and motifs that have been part of Ukrainian culture for centuries. To her, the eggs aren't just springtime ornaments. They're a connection to her heritage and proof that tradition can triumph over hardship and oppression.

A single egg might take three to five hours of work to complete, but she doesn't work on just one egg at a time. She might be writing a design on one egg while two or three others are soaking in dye.

The issues outlined in the report were jarring, including the clear involvement of athletic counselors who steered athletes into those bogus classes. From 1993 to 2011, those classes required no attendance and required only a research paper that received A's and B's without regard for quality, a cursory review often performed by an office secretary who also signed the chairman's name to grade rolls.

It's not that the Baltimore-based company doesn't want stylish fitness apparel and athletic shoes. Rather, the slogan speaks to its ambition to infuse its products with meaning — with stories about the histories and traits of the celebrity athletes they were created for — in hopes of deepening its connection to the athletes and inspiring customers to buy more gear.

Two different shoes designed for Curry, the NBA's reigning Most Valuable Player, reference Bible verses for the deeply religious star, while another displays a color pattern that is a nod to his father. Another shoe variation is the bright yellow, green and red "Candy Reign," hinting at the player's love of Sour Patch Kids.

Haley McConnaughey, 14, explains the trigonometry she did to figure out the dimensions for the blades on the robot's propellers. Older sister Hannah quickly wipes away some guacamole that escaped onto the machine.

"It definitely feels different," said Navarro, of North Philadelphia, who was 11 when she emigrated from Honduras. "Now, we don't have to watch our backs. We can live with our parents, and they can't deport us."

But it was a bittersweet victory. While Navarro, now 23, and her younger sister, Raquel, were lucky, their four older siblings were not. They had all missed the DACA deadline, one by less than a year.

"Returning seemed impossible," Turcios said. So, in 2002, she and her husband decided to send for her children to have them smuggled across the border for a shot at a better life. Over time, many from Turcios' extended family would make the journey.

The rest of the family moved, and then moved again, trying to stay ahead of ICE. Soon, Navarro's sister, too, received a notice saying she was to be deported. "She actually decided she was going to go to the immigration office, but she had two kids here," Navarro said. "She decided not to go. So we moved again. At that point, we thought someone was following us, so we moved again."

United Way's new early reading program, Club Connect Adopt-a-School, rolled out nationwide this week after testing in Fort Worth, Miami and New Orleans. It's the first time the nation's largest charity has adopted high-poverty schools across the country.

The new program was designed for the nation's poorest schools — those that receive federal aid for disadvantaged students — to give them books and other resources they don't otherwise have at home.

Providing low-cost, healthy options to local residents, Heath said, is a goal of The Pie Patch. Part of the benefit of having people pick their own fruit, is being able to cut out the costs of harvesting and transportation.

SquashSmarts in Philadelphia serves about 120 students in fifth through 12th grade, furnishing all necessary uniforms, equipment, snacks and academic space. Private donors and foundations provide nearly all of the club's annual $570,000 budget, executive director Stephen Gregg said.

SquashSmarts tracks participants' cardiovascular fitness, grade-point averages and college placements. In a district with a high dropout rate, all those who stayed in the club for seven years have graduated on time and been accepted to college, Gregg said.

Being able to hire Miller as squash director brings the program full circle, he said. She's now 23 and finishing an online degree from Penn State.

"When the students of SquashSmarts grow up to become the academic directors, the squash directors, the executive directors of this program," said Gregg, "that, to me, is change in a community."
SEATTLE — When Curtis Morrison moved to Seattle from the Northern Cheyenne Reservation in Montana, he found himself homeless, facing legal problems and in need of medicine to treat his depression.

He says he found help at the Chief Seattle Club, which eased the often difficult transition from living on the reservation to life in a large city. He's sober now and credits the club's Urban Indian Legal Clinic with helping him obtain the medication he needed for his depression and for helping him find housing.

"Other places didn't know what I was talking about, and nothing would happen," said Morrison, 45. "It was hard, but I have opportunities and a new beginning."

In Seattle, which has one of the highest populations of urban Indians in the country, the clinic provides a much-needed service for an often overlooked community, organizers say.

About seven of 10 Native Americans — 2.8 million — live in urban areas such as Seattle, according to the U.S. census. More than 1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives moved to metropolitan areas in the past 30 years.

The lawyers come from different backgrounds but have one thing in common: They have knowledge of Indian law and the Indian experience.

The idea for the Urban Indian Legal Clinic began at the end of 2006, according to Lael Echo-Hawk, a Pawnee, who was president of the Northwest Indian Bar Association at the time. The group wanted to provide a service to a population that is often insular or mistrusting of other mainstream opportunities. The Chief Seattle Club was a logical place to hold the clinic, she said.

An urban area also lacks the support base common on a reservation. Growing up on the Fond du Lac Reservation of Northern Minnesota, Dunlap said, he never knew his family was impoverished. Lefferson's family didn't have running water on the Blackfeet Reservation, she added, but everyone was poor on the reservation.

"All those things that are basically provided by the United States through treaties, when you come to the cities or urban areas, they're not there," said Chris Stearns, Navajo, a lawyer who specializes in Indian law and a former Seattle Human Rights Commission chairman.

The legal system often hasn't worked for clients in the past, and that affects their function and understanding of it, said Sean Cecil, a Seattle attorney and legal-clinic volunteer. A lot of times, the client's suffering is not a result of the decisions they made, according to Cecil, but from a lack of understanding of the legal processes.

BEIJING — Reflecting the urgency and scale scientists have called for to cope with climate change, the U.S. and Chinese presidents laid out ambitious new targets Wednesday to cut pollution in a deal that negotiators hope will inspire similarly dramatic commitments from other countries.

At a news conference in the Chinese capital, President Barack Obama said he had agreed that the U.S. would cut net greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent by 2025, doubling its current pace of carbon reduction. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a stepped-up time frame for carbon reduction and for increasing China's use of nuclear, wind and solar energy.

The deal arrives days after dozens of scientists, backed by the United Nations, issued a sweeping review of the latest research that says climate change is already affecting life on every continent and in the oceans, and the window is closing rapidly for governments to avert the worst damage expected to occur this century.

Under the deal, Xi announced targets for capping carbon emissions around 2030 — earlier than currently planned — and plans to increase the use of alternative energy to account for 20 percent of the country's total by 2030. That level of alternative energy would exceed that provided by all of China's coal-fired power plants now and be the equivalent of the United States' total electricity generation.

China is now by far the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Its severe air pollution has become a source of domestic discontent and international embarrassment that Chinese leaders can no longer ignore, said Wang Yiwei, director of the Institute of International Affairs at People's University in Beijing.

China is investing heavily in renewable and nuclear energy, and the economy is slowing. By some estimates, China's coal consumption this year might actually drop 1 percent to 2 percent, for the first time in decades. Beijing wants to shift its economic model toward one of less rapid, more "sustainable" growth and more sophisticated, less-polluting industries.

ACACIAS, Colombia — The man with the crash helmet and the American-flag shirt barrels down the muddy track on a muscled steed, chasing a bull the size of small car. Slipping in behind the galloping beast, he snatches its tail, wraps it around his fist and leans far off his saddle. The bull tumbles and rolls — spraying the cheering crowd with mud — before bouncing up and lumbering down the track.

Welcome to the world of coleo, a high-speed, high-risk sport that's hard on man, bull and spectators.

In this part of South America, coleo is a birthright, a practice learned by farmhands who have to chase down runaway cattle.

But these llanos, or plains, are also the epicenter of coleo sporting culture — drawing competitors from around Latin America and beyond. During a recent event, there were Venezuelans in their tri-color shirts, Mexicans with their chaps and wagon-wheel sombreros and men from South Florida who — in cowboy hats and boots — looked like they had just stepped out of a Marlboro ad.

"Anytime you're talking about taking an animal, grabbing its tail and flipping it, the whole process is fraught with danger for that animal," she said. "I don't think there's a way to change it to make it better."

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131230_CENSUS_maps.jpg" />WASHINGTON — Population growth in Southern and Western states, led by Texas, California and Florida, accounted for more than 80 percent of new residents nationwide over the last three years, surpassing the Northeast and Midwest in the demographic contest that plays a key role in determining states' political clout, census data released Monday show.

The Chinese middle and upper classes' penchant for ivory jewelry, art products and ornamental carvings could drive many countries' wild elephant populations to extinction, experts say. Tens of thousands of elephants are killed every year for their tusks, according to the Born Free Foundation, a wildlife organization. Mainland China is widely considered to be the world's biggest ivory consumer; the United States ranks second.

The nonprofit group Environmental Investigation Agency estimates that as much as 90 percent of mainland China's ivory is from smuggled tusks.

Best Buy Co. Inc. launched a trade-in program in 2009 for items such as cellphones, video games and computers, and it's getting more popular every year. It now accepts more than 11,000 different items. "The trade-in volume has doubled every year since 2009," Jeff Shelman, a Best Buy spokesman, wrote in an email.

At Pawn America's 29 Midwest locations, most cellphones, laptops and tablets are sold, not pawned, and the numbers keep growing. In 2013, sales of used cellphones were up 14 percent, laptop sales increased 30 percent and tablets sales doubled.

Consumers have a flurry of options to unload their old, but not too old, technology. Pawnshops have been a popular go-to for many years, but retailers such as Best Buy, Target, Wal-Mart and Radio Shack offer store credit in exchange for used personal electronics online or in stores.

So many sites will pay cash to people who mail in used devices (Gazelle.com, BuyBackWorld.com and Nextworth.com) that aggregators such as Usell.com have popped up, listing bids from multiple resellers.

In fact, an hour after Apple CEO Tim Cook debuted the iPhone 5S and 5C models on Sept. 10, Gazelle was getting 600 offers per second on earlier models, according to Anthony Scarsella, chief gadget officer at Gazelle.com.

Brennan said retailers need to reassure customers, employ staff with significant technical skills and offer some sort of a warranty.

SYRACUSE, Utah — For decades, fifth-generation farmer Neal Briggs has looked east to the mighty Wasatch range and seen the promise of a verdant future.

"This is one of those years farmers will tell their grandkids about," said Utah state hydrologist Randall Julander. "About just how dry it was and how bad it was."

U.S. speed limits are rising nationwide, especially in wide-open Western states, reflecting the more-harried lifestyles of a fast-paced nation. But many safety officials are scratching their heads over a perilous trend they say will lead to more — and more ghastly — fatalities. Each year, excessive speed contributes to one-third of highway deaths nationally.

Experts at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam authenticated the 1888 landscape "Sunset at Montmajour" with the help of Vincent Van Gogh's letters, chemical analysis of the pigments and X-rays of the canvas.

Museum director Axel Rueger, at an unveiling ceremony, called the discovery a "once-in-a-lifetime experience."

The roughly 37-by-29-inch "Sunset at Montmajour" depicts a dry landscape of twisting oak trees, bushes and sky, and was done during the period when Van Gogh was increasingly adopting the thick "impasto" brush strokes that became typical of his work in the final years of his short life.

According to a reconstruction published in The Burlington Magazine by three researchers, the painting was recorded as number 180 in Theo's collection and given the title "Sun Setting at Arles." It was sold to French art dealer Maurice Fabre in 1901.

Fabre never recorded selling the work, and the painting disappeared from history until it reappeared in 1970 in the estate of Norwegian industrialist Christian Nicolai Mustad.

The Mustad family said Mustad purchased it in 1908 as a young man in one of his first forays into art collecting, but was soon told by the French ambassador to Sweden that it was a fake. Embarrassed, Mustad banished it to the attic.

After Mustad's death in 1970, the distinguished art dealer Daniel Wildenstein said he thought the painting was a fake Van Gogh or possibly the work of a lesser-known German painter, and it was sold to a collector. The museum would not say who bought it or whether it had been resold since then.

"That may be a painful admission, given that the same museum is now attributing it to Van Gogh, but it is understandable," since experts had no information about what the painting depicted, the Burlington Magazine article said.

Among other reasons experts had their doubts: The painting was unsigned. Parts of the foreground were not "as well-observed as usual," the researchers said. And part of the right side of the painting used a different style of brush strokes.

But when the museum took a fresh look at the work in 2011, its experts had the advantage of a new compendium of all Van Gogh's letters, and they were able to identify for the first time the exact location "Sunset" depicts: Montmajour hill, near Arles. The ruins of Montmajour abbey can be seen in the background.

Van Gogh mentioned the painting in two other letters the same summer.

SANTA MONICA, Calif. — The display at the Weiser Family Farms' stand at a recent Santa Monica farmers market was sparse, even by early spring standards — potatoes, some green shallots and garlic, a little sprouting broccoli. The lilacs that signal the start of spring for many Southern Californians came and went weeks ago.

That, in a nutshell, is the state of California's nearly $30 billion produce industry, which accounts for more than half of the fresh fruits and vegetables grown in America.

Fruit has been ripening and ready to pick at almost shockingly early dates. At the same time, some vegetables have been in extremely short supply, resulting in much higher than normal prices. Lettuces are selling at wholesale for twice what they were at this time last year. Cauliflower has doubled just since February.

Summer, on the other hand, will be coming early. The Weisers took advantage of the warm weather to plant their highly sought Ogen and Sugar Cube melons three weeks earlier. They should ripen in a couple of weeks rather than in mid-June.

"Usually you might see a gap in one commodity," Antle said, "but when I look at our sales sheet today, everything across board is much higher (in price) than it usually is."

"As soon as we put our best-laid plans on paper, Mother Nature comes along," said Mark McBride of Coastline Family Farms, a major vegetable grower based in the Salinas Valley. "All winter we've been 10 to 21 days ahead of schedule, and for the next few weeks we're going to have to pay the piper for that" — with much less to sell, until other crops come in.

The situation is noticeably brighter for fruit lovers. Just as the warm winter weather has pushed Southern California's glorious purple jacaranda bloom to an earlier start, so it has with tree fruit such as cherries, apricots, even peaches and nectarines.

"I'm here because we are tired of the government we have," said Maria Archer, a Venezuelan who has lived in the United States for 15 years. "It is a government that represses the people, that does not allow freedom of expression, that is responsible for staple shortages and violence. Thus, we are urging the international community to assist us in ridding Venezuela of this government."

Said Blanca Aleman, 44, of Weston, Fla.: "I was born and raised in Venezuela. I love my country and I want my kids to know the country I knew, not what it is now."

While her 18-year-old son Marc Burnard was able to accompany her, Aleman's parents and brother are still back in Venezuela.

In Venezuela, protests over the past two weeks have resulted in violence and deaths as government opponents and supporters have both taken to the streets. Competing rallies in the deeply divided nation took place again on Saturday in Caracas. At least 10 deaths have been reported since Feb. 12.

The ongoing protests have been characterized by some media observers in Caracas as the biggest since Maduro replaced President Hugo Chavez, who died March 5 last year.

"My brother is a Type I diabetic," Arocha said. "He can't find insulin."

Although the overwhelming majority of supporters at the rally were Venezuelan, other Latin American communities joined the movement.

Cuban-born Berardo Barrero said he took part in the rally because he can relate to the situation in Venezuela.

"You have to stand up for the right to liberty in all countries," said Barrero, 57, of Miami Gardens, Fla.

One of the prominent Cuban exiles on hand at the Doral rally was Democracy Movement leader Ramon Saul Sanchez, who has organized several "freedom flotillas" to waters near Cuba.

"I'm here to lend solidarity to the Venezuelan people," Sanchez said. "And to tell the Venezuelan people that the Cubans who are murdering their people and that are violating their sovereignty are not representatives of the Cuban people, and that in many cases they are even victims of the Cuban dictatorship."

"It's great," said Venezuelan Andrea Taglia Ferro, 29, of the Latin American solidarity. "Our situation is touching them."

She added that social media has helped raise awareness.

"The country is sinking," said Enrique Chacon, a native of San Cristobal in Venezuela. The 45-year-old attended the rally with his brother, sister-in-law, nephew and niece.

CARACAS, Venezuela — Waiting in line for hours to buy groceries at a supermarket in eastern Caracas, Helena Siso didn't know or care who was to blame for the acute shortages of consumer goods plaguing Venezuela. She just wanted the government to do something about it.

"This is very frustrating," said Siso, a 54-year-old secretary. "Here I am on my lunch hour and I have to spend three hours in line to buy toilet paper. Tomorrow, I'll have to come back to get corn flour. I don't want the government to give me anything, just save me from submitting to these lines and this desperation."

The program, made possible through partnerships with animal shelters and animal advocacy groups statewide, allows select offenders the opportunity to train rescue dogs. It's a one-hour drive for Turner to Silverglat's clinic to have the dogs treated.

Building the business didn't come easy for Silverglat. He estimates he has pumped several million dollars of his own money into his business over 13 years and continues to reap little, financially.

Led by President Barack Obama, civil and military officials across the nation placed wreaths on monuments to honor those who served in wars that have marked the nation's turbulent history. They have also backed more employment opportunities for veterans.

In New York, Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody, who retired last year after 37 years in the Army, led the parade up Fifth Avenue to honor veterans. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 21.2 million military veterans as of 2012 in the United States. Of that group 1.6 million are women.

It was in 1948 that President Harry Truman officially ended discrimination in the armed forces and the eventual end of its segregation by race. In 2012, those identifying themselves as non-Hispanic whites made up 79.6 percent of the veterans, with African Americans the second-largest group at 11.3 percent. Hispanics were at 5.7 percent.

The centerpiece of the nation's observance is the traditional televised laying of a wreath by the president at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery. The usual 21-gun artillery salute was fired and the president joined by representatives of all of the services, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard, as well as Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric K. Shinseki and others.

Obama paid tribute to one of the nation's oldest veterans, Richard Overton, 107, "This is the life of one American veteran, living proud and strong in the land he helped keep free," Obama said during proceedings at Arlington.

Earlier, the president also hosted a Veterans Day breakfast at the White House for those who have served in the military and their families.

What today is known as Veterans Day began as Armistice Day on Nov. 11, 1919, to commemorate the end of World War I. Congress created an annual observance in 1926 and Nov. 11 became a national holiday in 1939.

WASHINGTON — It took decades, congressional legislation and a review of thousands of war records, but two dozen veterans of World War II, Korea and Vietnam received the Medal of Honor on Tuesday from President Barack Obama at a somber and tearful White House ceremony.

"I'm busting with pride," said Charles Baldonado, 77, whose brother Joe R. Baldonado was among those honored posthumously. Joe Baldonado, who was from Los Angeles, died at age 20 in Korea, where he used a machine gun to drive back enemy troops as grenades exploded around him. Eventually, he was killed by one.

Obama has awarded the Medal of Honor to strapping young veterans of the war in [Afghanistan](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=Afghanistan), but Tuesday's recipients were different. They included three living honorees: a 68-year-old retired postal worker, a 72-year-old retired salesman and great-grandfather, and a 76-year-old retiree who the president noted enjoys mowing the grass for his neighbors.

With smoky barbecue scent filling the air and '80s hip-hop thumping from a speaker, two inner-city teens led their teams up and down the forest preserve field in a friendly but spirited game of pickup football.

Alex, 18 and wiry, weaves across the field, making athletic catches and striding into the end zone, but Sammy, 15 and a dedicated school athlete, later returns a punt to win the game. As he sprints downfield, Sammy turns to the cheering sideline, his face breaking into a smile, reflecting the laid-back vibe of a summer day. The madness is miles away.

Alex and Sammy live in a place where porches get shot up and the menacing slide of a passing van's door can carry a deadly threat. Surviving demands rapid decisions, urgent navigation to safety or, as Sammy — who counts three near-misses in his life — describes it, just dumb luck.

Rivera's belief echoes a new wave of research that has found surprising advantages in an activity that many dismiss as a waste of time, if not an outright menace. Social scientists have recently linked gaming with enhanced mental skills, moral sensitivity and even physical fitness, creating a new image of this ubiquitous but controversial pastime.

"We're working really hard on understanding what aspects of gaming could be leveraged for the betterment of society," said Daphne Bavelier, a cognitive neuroscientist who researches video games at the University of Geneva in Switzerland and the University of Rochester in New York. "Everyone understands it's here to stay. It's not going to disappear. You could try to ban it, but it seems to have really interesting positive effects."

But the gaming technology adds a new twist.

But a closer glance at this field in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park shows something isn't quite right. They're pitching underhand. No one is using a batting helmet, fielding glove or catcher's mask. And what's up with those floppy hats and groomed mustaches?

"Striker to the line!" bellows a man wearing a straw hat, suit and bow tie.

This is not your father's baseball. Or even your grandfather's baseball. It's your great-great-grandfather's game.

The Athletic Base Ball Club of Philadelphia plays America's favorite pastime the old-fashioned way. It's one of a growing number of teams nationwide that recreates the 19th century through historically accurate uniforms, period rules and cheeky nicknames. And by spelling "baseball" as two words.

Donned in period garb, students chatted with show-goers who stopped to admire the Scripps, take pictures and ask questions. When it came time for the awards ceremony (the Scripps got a participation award), the show's announcer name-checked Penn College as he talked up the students' work.

Drake said Confederate flag symbols have been banned at Christiansburg High since 2002, following a year when the campus was roiled by racially motivated fights between students, some of which were linked back to students wearing Confederate symbols.

Morley, who is black, said seeing the flag bothered him, but he never piped up around his white classmates who donned it. While his classmates said the flag symbolized their pride in their Confederate roots, Morley said it made him think of slavery. His stepfather is a descendant of a slave, and his father's family, from the Bahamas, likely has slave roots as well.

LOS ANGELES — Cal State Los Angeles biology students are breeding fruit flies to learn how mutations, such as white eyes or curved wings, are passed to future generations. On other campuses, subjects on treadmills are monitored for changes in blood pressure and heart rate.

These are fairly common lab experiments, except for one thing: They are being conducted via computer.

At colleges and universities across the country, students increasingly are using online simulations, animation and other technologies to replicate — and, some say, improve upon — the hands-on experience of a typical lab.

In complex cases ranging from enlarged prostates to brain tumors, physicians at the University of Minnesota are using virtual-reality simulators more and more to perfect their surgical techniques. And, in what may be the most significant change in surgical training since the early 1900s, they are working with local medical device companies to develop new generations of software to train the next generation of medical students.

"Have you ever seen a pitcher not warm up before their first pitch, or a musician not warm up before they go on stage? Never!" Sweet said. "Why would a surgeon be any different?"

Sweet, 44, said the idea for simulator training came to him as he was learning prostate surgery during his third year of residency at the University of Washington.

Sweet dropped by the school's Human Interface Technology lab and they built one. But early simulators were crude compared to the ones being developed now.

LIVERMORE, Calif. — Your head aches, you're congested and simply getting out of bed is a chore. You pay a visit to your doctor, and within minutes — using a simple cheek swab placed in a tiny box — he knows precisely which virus or bacteria is causing the symptoms and prescribes the right treatment.

In the spring of 2012, 6-year-old Emma Whitehead was close to death. She was suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a form of cancer.

"The reality is the dramatic responses of cancer to new treatments are very unusual," Grupp told Kauffman.  "We need to make it clear when we talk to a family that (this treatment) may not work."

"Producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient," Dr. June told The New York Times. "Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive."

So far, the results have been staggering — of the 250 students tested between January and March, 150 met the criteria for needing glasses.

"We were very surprised," said Dr. David Friedman, director of Hopkins' Dana Center for Preventive Ophthalmology and a principal investigator on the study. "That's twice as many glasses as we typically prescribe in this population."

The Maryland State Department of Education requires students to be screened for vision only in the first grade and ninth grade. That leaves a big gap for problems to go unnoticed.

Julie Gray has been teaching at Charles Carroll Barrister for 16 years. When a student is struggling to read, she said, vision problems are the last thing she's looking for.

But challenges remain with follow-through, Wen said. Fewer than 20 percent of students who screen positive for vision deficiencies end up getting glasses, she said. That leaves the health department and the school system trying to reach parents.

HOPE MILLS, N.C. — Alberta Currie, the great-granddaughter of slaves, was born in a farmhouse surrounded by tobacco and cotton fields. Her mother, Willie Pearl, gave birth with the assistance of a midwife.

No birth certificate was issued; a birth announcement was handwritten into the Currie family Bible.

Today, 78 years later, that absence of official documentation may force Currie to sit out an election for the first time since 1956. Under a restrictive new voter ID law in North Carolina, a state-issued photo ID is required for voting as of the 2016 election.

Voters can obtain a state-issued ID at no cost. But that requires getting to a state driver's license office, waiting in line — and providing documents that many voters lack, among them an original or certified birth certificate and original Social Security card.

Currie has spent three years trying, without success, to persuade officials to issue her a birth certificate. Now, because of the new law, she must locate several other documents, a daunting challenge for someone her age.

WASHINGTON - The Justice Department sued North Carolina on Monday in a bid to block a new state law that forces voters to present a photo identification before casting a ballot and limits early voting, arguing the measure discriminates against minorities.

The North Carolina law is one of a series enacted in Republican-governed states imposing new requirements on casting ballots. Republicans argue that the changes are needed to combat voter fraud. Democrats assert that the laws are intended to make it harder for blacks and other voters who are likely to vote for Democratic candidates to cast their ballots.

That portal has opened wider this month, as two of the major players in the field offered fresh glimpses of their tech. Oculus VR unveiled more information about its headset earlier this month, and Sony provided more details on the launch of Project Morpheus at E3, the video game trade show that ended last week.

The roots of virtual reality lay partly in the Bay Area. Inventor Jack McCauley said his lab here was the ground floor where Oculus, a VR leader that was purchased by Facebook for $2 billion last year, started in 2012. It was where the Kickstarter video for the device was filmed, and the former Oculus vice president of engineering said McCauley had a hand in the design of the prototypes and the production of the development kits that went out to the crowdfunding backers.

Following an independent investigation, Volkswagen has admitted installing "defeat devices" in as many as 11 million diesel engines. The devices enabled cars to pass emissions tests while, in normal operation, spewing 40 times more than the legal amount of pollution-causing nitrogen oxide.

AUSTIN, Texas — Managers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in Texas have a new task to add to their list of duties: asking customers if they have a permit to carry a handgun.

"Now that it's open carry, that creates a new space that you have to cover," said George Kelemen, chief executive officer of the Texas Retailers Association. Stores like Wal-Mart want "to make absolutely sure that the message they convey is, 'We welcome your patronage, but we sell alcohol and we don't want to risk losing the ability to do that."'

Some companies are trying to walk a fine line by publicly opposing guns in their Texas stores, while stopping short of posting state-issued signs that serve as a legal notice that firearms are prohibited. The coffee giant Starbucks Corp. has requested that customers who aren't law-enforcement personnel refrain from bringing firearms of any kind into stores, but hasn't issued a ban, according to spokeswoman Jaime Riley. Target Corp. has also asked customers not to carry guns openly, even though it hasn't displayed the signs prohibiting the practice, said spokeswoman Molly Snyder.

That balancing act is not sitting well with gun-control advocates. The Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America has begun targeting stores that have publicly opposed the open-carry law but haven't displayed the official signs prohibiting it. The group is affiliated with Everytown for Gun Safety, a group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg that advocates for stricter laws. The ex-mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg LP.

"The strongest statement businesses can make for their customers' safety and care is getting that sign up," said Alexandra Chasse, a spokeswoman for the Texas chapter of Moms Demand Action.

Wal-Mart, which itself sells rifles and shotguns, says it's asking customers to show a pistol permit only in Texas stores that sell alcohol. When it comes to allowing guns in stores nationwide, the company says its policy is to follow all local, state and federal laws, said Nick.

Still, its stance has begun to trouble gun-rights activists as they walk into their local Supercenter with pistols on their hips.

Startled by the encounter, Bravo de Rueda nonetheless pulled out her permit and proceeded to shop.

This year, 10 walrus were harvested, according to Diomede hunter Robert Soolook. There's no shortage of walrus, he said, but they are migrating sooner. No one has initiated any long-range planning to address the shift, but Soolook believes hunters eventually will need to change their practices, even going out earlier.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Pacific walrus that can't find sea ice for resting in Arctic waters are coming ashore in record numbers on a beach in northwest Alaska.

The enormous gathering was spotted during NOAA's annual Arctic marine mammal aerial survey, spokeswoman Julie Speegle said by email. The survey is conducted with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency that oversees offshore lease sales.

Pacific walrus spend winters in the Bering Sea. Females give birth on sea ice and use ice as a diving platform to reach snails, clams and worms on the shallow continental shelf.

Unlike seals, walrus cannot swim indefinitely and must rest. They use their tusks to "haul out," or pull themselves onto ice or rocks.

As temperatures warm in summer, the edge of the sea ice recedes north. Females and their young ride the edge of the sea ice into the Chukchi Sea, the body of water north of the Bering Strait.

In recent years, sea ice has receded north beyond shallow continental shelf waters and into Arctic Ocean water, where depths exceed 2 miles and walrus cannot dive to the bottom.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Six decades ago, as construction crews began developing swaths of a Kansas City meadow near the Blue River, a man concerned about the impact on history began showing up with a metal detector.

He found belt buckles, revolvers, bayonets, unexploded artillery shells — even a carved bullet that may have been used as a chess piece. Often he arrived after big rains, in case rushing water had revealed something previously hidden. And whenever new construction commenced, he asked permission to look around.

Visitors to the Battle of Westport Visitors Center and Museum in Swope Park during the battle's 150th anniversary commemoration, which began on Oct. 23, can see what Adams saved. About 75 artifacts that he culled from the area now known as the Byram's Ford Big Blue Battlefield will be on exhibit.

The average surface temperature on Earth was higher in 2014 than at any time since scientists began taking detailed measurements 135 years ago.

### PRO: U.S. withdrawal plucks defeat from the jaws of victory

WASHINGTON — Former secretary of state, national security adviser and Nobel Peace Prize winner Henry Kissinger is, by all measures, a foreign policy heavyweight. At a recent black-tie dinner, he stood — stoop-shouldered and peering imperiously over his signature thick, black-frame glasses — and remarked: "Unilateral withdrawal is not victory."

Though many Vietnam War protesters, including now Secretary of State John Kerry, trumpet America's withdrawal as a triumph, there is no reason to be proud of how we left. While we can still debate the wisdom of going to war there, there is no doubt that our total abandonment of our allies left a bloody and shameful legacy.

Dr. Kissinger's comments weren't meant to recall ancient history. He was lamenting history repeating itself. The prospects are now high that Afghanistan will fail … needlessly.

Outfitted with a seven-barrel Gatling gun the size of a Volkswagen Beetle in its nose, the Cold War-era plane has a reputation for tearing apart armored tanks and clearing the way for troops on the ground with its massive 30 mm rounds of ammunition.

But the unsightly plane has been in the cross hairs of Pentagon officials in recent years. The Air Force — better known for aerial dogfights and dropping GPS-guided bombs — would rather invest its diminishing funds elsewhere. With billions of dollars in budget cuts and a possible second round of sequestration looming, the military faces tough decisions: keep funding proven planes of the past or invest in high-tech 21st-century weapons.

SEATTLE — With Washington state experiencing the worst mountain snowpack in decades and a drought emergency declared two weeks ago, farmers, growers and wildlife managers are preparing for a tough summer as conditions are expected to worsen.

The stream of subtropical moisture dropped more than an inch of rain over much of Los Angeles County by evening, with higher numbers in the local mountains. In foothills and canyons where fires recently burned desiccated brush, residents scrambled to set up barricades to divert debris flows and prepared to evacuate.

The storm and deluge that hit Northern California last weekend gave state water officials the first glimmer of hope in more than a year; on Monday they increased 2015 water allocations in response to improving precipitation forecasts.

In the San Gabriel foothills below where the Colby fire burned in January, the perspective was anything but new: keep the mud away from homes.

More than 18,000 sandbags were distributed in Glendora in anticipation of the storm, in addition to the 50,000 given out earlier in the year.

Los Angeles County firefighters came Monday night to put sandbags around Ed Heinlein's home on Ridge View Drive in Azusa. Heinlein, 66, darted around his property Tuesday reinforcing a plywood barricade with wire.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — There are many reasons Ron Morgan's 100 Gardens project could fail, but there are more reasons he's determined to make it work, one vegetable seedling at a time.

The idea behind the nonprofit came to Morgan after a trip to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. An architect by training, he traveled there with members of Steele Creek Presbyterian Church, expecting to design shelters for some of the 1.5 million people left homeless.

Because there's little arable land available in Haiti, other groups are also experimenting with aquaponics.

One night after returning from Haiti, Morgan was at the Comet Grill in Dilworth, N.C., talking about how much he wanted to help, but how little he knew about farming. A man at the next table said: "You've got to meet George."

PLEASANTON, Calif. — Leon Jung figured he had to do something out of the ordinary to save his brown front lawn in a second year of water rationing.

The Dublin San Ramon district — a combined water and sewer agency — opened the recycled water station in July with three spigots and minimal expectations. Now the station has eight spigots with another eight to be added soon to keep up with spiraling demand. Anyone can take the water — not just district residents — and some people drive in from 30 miles away.

Americans use twice the amount of water they think they do, and appear to be particularly oblivious about how much H2O they flush down the toilet on a daily basis, according to new research.

In a paper published online Monday in the journal PNAS, a researcher concluded that Americans underestimated their water use by a factor of 2, and were only slightly aware of how much water goes into growing the food they eat.

The study's conclusions were based on an Internet survey of 1,020 people, and come amid a national drought that extends from the Pacific Coast to portions of the Mississippi Valley, with the most severe conditions in California.

MADERA COUNTY, Calif. — Under the blistering Central Valley sun, Filiberta Sanchez and her toddler granddaughter strolled down a Parkwood sidewalk lined with yellow weeds, dying grass and trees more fit for kindling than shade.

Parkwood is one of 28 small California communities that have since January cycled onto and off of a list of "critical water systems" that state officials say could run dry within 60 days. Amid the drought that is scorching the state and particularly the Central Valley, the State Water Resources Control Board decided this year, for the first time ever, to track areas on the brink of waterlessness.

On a recent afternoon, Dugger stood in the bone-dry river bed. It dried up a few months ago, and the one 27-foot-deep well that still works can't pump enough water for the resort. Arroyo Seco means "dry creek" in Spanish, Dugger said, and "It's living up to its name."

The resort has asked for state help to dig wells as deep as 200 feet. Meanwhile, residents are asked not to water outdoors, leaving the once lush resort faded and brown.

Yet dry farming has its adherents. Many are small farmers and vintners who either lack irrigated water or believe that dry farming produces better-tasting fruits and vegetables.

"This year is a whole new level of crazy," said Ara Azhderian of the San Joaquin &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority, representing many farmers who are forecast to get zero water this year.

Mostly, it's about river water allowed to reach the Pacific Ocean through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta — a perennial California argument filled with suspicion, lawsuits and politics.

Since Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency in January, water leaders have been working daily on adjustments in the state's water system — each of which triggers more angst.

WASHINGTON — When geophysicist H. Jay Melosh attended a meeting of U.S. and ex-Soviet nuclear weapons designers in May 1995, he was surprised by how eager the Cold Warriors were to work together against an unlikely but dangerous extraterrestrial threat: asteroids on a collision course with Earth.

After Edward Teller, the father of the hydrogen bomb, urged others meeting at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California to consider building and orbiting huge, new nuclear weapons for planetary protection, some top Russian weapons experts lent their support.

"It was a really bizarre thing to see that these weapons designers were willing to work together — to build the biggest bombs ever," said Melosh, an expert in space impacts who has an asteroid named after him.

Nuclear weapons could be used in two ways, he said. When the collision is still a decade or longer away, a "standoff" nuclear blast could knock the asteroid off course. When the time to impact is short, he said, defenders would try to blow up the asteroid.

"It's so unfortunate that our society has come to this, that we feel that more militarizing will actually solve a problem. It has yet to do that," said Marlyn Tillman, a co-founder of Gwinnett SToPP, which opposes stationing police in schools. "We're turning to a solution that really is the problem."

CHICAGO — Snow-covered roads, high winds and ice were creating dangerous driving conditions Sunday from the Dakotas to Missouri to Delaware ahead of a "polar vortex" that'll bring below-zero — and possibly record-breaking — temperatures not seen in years to much of the nation.

WASHINGTON — Will wildfires grow ever bigger, more frequent — and deadlier? Those who live in the rugged West are enduring another summer of scorched-earth devastation.

Nationwide, the six worst fire seasons since 1960 have burned in the past 13 years. That includes 2012, when 9.2 million acres went up in flames. The worst year was 2006, when 9.8 million acres burned.

Western state lawmakers have called on the federal government for more help and criticized its management of public lands, where large fires often start and then spread to private and state lands. That's no small issue in a region dominated by federally owned lands, which cover about 70 percent of Arizona and virtually all of Nevada, for example. The U.S. Forest Service labels about 65 million acres of its land "high or very high risk of catastrophic wildfires." At the same time, these lawmakers are pondering how to use their own scarce resources. While some conditions, including hotter, drier weather, are beyond their control, states and localities can dictate where people live.

Whether craving rugged terrain or a semblance of solitude, westerners are increasingly settling in communities abutting wilderness that make up what's called the wildland urban interface, or WUI. The population shift has brought in new fire threats and put more people and property in harm's way, while also making firefighting more complicated and expensive.

A 22-foot beaked whale that apparently took a wrong turn up an African river about 17 million years ago may offer clues to the climate-change forces that shaped human evolution.

Fossil and geologic evidence correlate that uplift with a long-term drying of the local climate, which changed a humid forest into grasslands with more widely spaced trees. Scientists theorize that this kind of environmental pressure favored primates that could straighten their backs and walk longer distances on two feet, leading to the radiation into species that led to modern humans.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/20131205_BEACHEDWHALES.jpg" />FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — More than 90 whales have become stranded on Florida beaches in the past two months, almost three times the average, baffling marine biologists and making them wonder if a deadly common denominator is at play.

Scientists probing a giant plug of earwax pulled from a dead blue whale have discovered in its hardened layers a detailed biography of the wild animal's life, from birth to death, in 6-month chapters.

But unlike the other whales, the 25-foot-long young adult stuck near the surface — and it didn't dive down to feast on the blooms of krill that attract humpbacks to the bay. "It wouldn't fluke up," Nancy Black, a marine biologist on board the ship that day said, referring to the picture-perfect tail flip that humpbacks display before diving to feed. Looking closer, the passenger on the Point Sur also noticed several buoys were strangely close to the whale, trailing behind it.

Most crab pots are removed from the water in the winter, after the largest crabs are taken, said Pete Kalvass, a senior marine biologist with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. So in the past, he said, whales rarely tangled with crab fishing gear. But in recent weeks, four entangled whales were reported off the West Coast. Two were freed, including a humpback let loose May 6 off the Oregon coast. Crews were unable to attach satellite telemetry tags to two others, and they have not been spotted again.

At least 30 whales – most of them grays and humpbacks – were entangled in vertical lines between buoys floating on the surface and crab traps on the ocean floor in 2014, a record number and nearly twice that reported the previous year, according to NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service.

<img class="pull-right" src="https://newsela-test-files-f331e.s3.amazonaws.com/article_media/extra/sat-vs-aerial-photo.jpg" />A satellite orbiting Earth has spotted 55 southern right whales hanging out in the shallow waters off Argentina.

In a paper published Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, Fretwell argues that tracking the southern right whale population by satellite is not only possible but efficient.

AKRON, Ohio — The gladiators' legs were tucked inside their machines. On their hands, they placed a foam-like wrap, followed by gloves and duct tape, sticky side up. It was time to do battle.

Wheelchair rugby was originally called murderball, and for good reason. It's a fierce game with metal-on-metal and sometimes skin-on-floor contact.

Now just three aging members of the subspecies survive at Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a preserve in Kenya. All are too old or unhealthy to breed naturally -- barring scientific intervention, when these last three die, their subspecies dies with them.

Veterinarian Barbara Durrant of the San Diego Zoo's Institute for Conservation Research told Live Science that she and other researchers are working to develop a rhino in vitro fertilization procedure that would allow them to implant an embryo produced from preserved egg and sperm. But the number of preserved reproductive cells is tiny -- they come from just 12 northern whites -- and the procedure is still a long way from being ready to use them. Durrant said it's only been done twice, and both times the embryo never developed beyond a cluster of just two cells.

The San Diego Zoo has set aside $2 million for an effort that would use southern white rhino mothers as surrogates to carry northern white rhino embryos, according to Scientific American.

Decades of research and millions of dollars have been spent by government and private organizations to revive the species, whose population shrank to 23 in 1954, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The deaths of the whooping cranes in Kentucky and Louisiana bring the number of intentional killings of the [endangered species](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=endangered+birds) to at least 19 since 2001. That exceeds the average number of cranes — 13 — released into the wild each year by conservationists, according to Operation Migration.

The fire burned 257,000 acres of High Sierra wilderness straddling the Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park that harbors a geographically isolated and genetically distinct clan of roughly 200 great gray owls.

The existence of the foxes, which were thought to have been wiped out in the 1920s, was confirmed in 2010. They are currently under consideration for listing under the federal Endangered Species Act.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — Nineteen firefighters died Sunday while battling a fast-moving wildfire northwest of Phoenix, the worst firefighter loss of life in a wildland blaze since 1933.

The firefighters went missing while fighting the Yarnell Hill fire, an out-of-control blaze that had engulfed the evacuated community of Yarnell, population 649, burning down much of the town, officials said. An estimated 200 structures were lost.

The firefighters belonged to the Granite Mountain Interagency Hotshot Crew, an elite unit sponsored by a fire department in nearby Prescott, where residents were grieving through social media after word of the deaths arrived Sunday night.

The Chinese capital was awarded the 2022 Winter Olympics on Friday, beating Kazakh rival Almaty 44-40 in a surprisingly close vote marred by technical problems, taking the Olympic Games back to the city that hosted the summer version in 2008.

Beijing was seen by the International Olympic Committee as a secure, reliable choice that also offered vast commercial opportunities in a new winter sports market of more than 300 million people in northern China.

"It really is a safe choice," IOC President Thomas Bach said. "We know China will deliver on its promises."

Defenders of the wolves note there have been no documented wolf attacks in New Mexico or Arizona. Fears of wolves attacking humans, they say, are overblown, and the cages nothing more than a stunt.

In 1995, the reintroduction of Canadian gray wolves into the northern Rockies ignited a furor.

Now that acrimony has cascaded into the Southwest, where the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to extend Endangered Species Act protections for an estimated 75 Mexican wolves in the wild in New Mexico and Arizona.

IRONWOOD, Mich. — John Koski grips the old blanket in knobby hands weathered from a lifetime of farming. He pulls it back to reveal the carcasses of two cows, or what's left of them. More than half of each is picked clean, the spine and rib bones almost a polished white, with no traces of flesh. Some of the rib bones are snapped and show evidence of being gnawed upon.

The mutilated cattle, found this spring on Koski's 1,000-acre farm in the tiny community of Matchwood in Ontonogan County, are the latest casualties in his ongoing war with wolves. The 68-year-old farmer has had more cattle killed or injured by wolves than any farmer in the state, 119 in the past three years, according to the state of Michigan. Government-paid sharpshooters and trappers for years have killed dozens of the wolves who've taken a liking to Koski's cattle.

"I think this is the last year I'm going to keep cattle here because I'm losing so many," Koski said, adding that he may move them to his other farmland in Bessemer, about 35 miles away.

Over the last few years, the city of Ironwood, about an hour west of Koski's farm, has seen the nearby wolf population increase, as well as encounters between wolves and people, city manager Scott Erickson said.

"There's a wolf problem in the area — I think everybody understands that," he said. "I've never heard anybody say they want to eliminate wolves, but just manage them in an appropriate manner."

If state and federal biologists are right, OR7 and his mystery mate would be the first known wolves to breed in the Oregon Cascades since the early 20th century. The possibility has sparked hope among lovers of all things lupine that the species could take hold again in California, which has had no known wolf presence for nearly 100 years.

"OR7 is over 250 miles from the nearest known wolf pack," said John Stephenson, an Oregon-based wolf biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who has been monitoring the animal. "It always seemed like a real long shot that he'd find a female wolf in that area. There aren't any.

OR7 trekked back and forth between Oregon and California over the next few years. But recently the wolf's behavior changed. He began to exhibit what biologists call "denning" or "localizing," spending his time in a relatively small area in southwestern Oregon.

"We were curious," Stephenson said. "His collar is getting old. It's over three years, and three years is the lifespan of those collars. We'd been getting a lot of questions about whether we would re-collar him. We weren't going to. He's a lone wolf. There's only so much information you can get."

But with his new habits, the scientists decided to make one last effort "before the collar went out to see if he had found anybody," Stephenson said. "I put some cameras out. I'm glad we did. I'm still very surprised by it. It's pretty cool."

The two wolves had never been photographed together, which made their relationship especially hard to confirm. But on May 3, biologists caught a break. At 6:30 a.m., OR7 was photographed sauntering by one of the remote cameras. An hour later, the female ran past the same spot.

"They're in the same area," Stephenson said. "They certainly know about each other ... It's very likely they've paired up."

Now, with wolf packs solidly re-established and widely ranging in the West, state wildlife officials say it is reasonable to conclude California will host a functional wolf population within 10 years. The California Fish and Game Commission is debating how to manage that population once it is established.

LEAVENWORTH, Wash. — Biologist Don Youkey picked his way along a log nailed to a tree trunk nearly 5 feet above the ground and reached overhead to hang a cow knuckle bone and chunk of raw rib meat.

People do it. So do chimpanzees, bonobos and baboons. Even dogs do it: They yawn when someone near them yawns. But why? Scientists believe it's a sign that these animals are capable of feeling empathy — and a new study of wolves suggests it's more widespread among animals than experts had realized.

"Yawning in wolves is contagious," the researchers concluded. And that makes sense, they added: "For a highly social animal such as the wolf, coordinating activities has obvious adaptive advantages, since it promotes social cohesiveness of the pack."

Serova and Cristoforetti's joint flight comes as U.S. medical researchers take an updated look at gender differences in space. With space station missions spanning a half-year and expected to last considerably longer on trips to Mars, NASA wants to make sure all astronauts — male and female alike — stay safe and healthy.

KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia — They strapped on their helmets and goggles, boldly raced down a steep icy ramp, and then, like pioneer aviator Amelia Earhart 80 years ago, the female ski jumpers of the 2014 Winter Olympics took flight and made history Tuesday night at the RusSki Gorki Jumping Center.

"I think there's a preconceived notion that men are braver than women,'' said Bill Hendrickson, Sarah's father. "It takes a lot of guts and confidence for these women to go off this big ski jump. They are dispelling that myth that just men are brave enough to go off these big jumps. There certainly are ladies out there that have aptitude, athleticism, bravery and courage to do the same kinds of things men do.''

The coaster is being built by the upstart innovator in wooden coasters, Rocky Mountain Construction Group, out of Hayden, Idaho. Before launching the business with his wife, co-founder Fred Grubb was a carpenter and welder building coasters at Silverwood Theme Park in Idaho. Frequently working to repair old wooden coasters, which often wore out where the wheels made contact, he and his engineers decided there must be a better way.

While traditional wooden roller coasters like the American Eagle or Little Dipper at Great America have simple steel plates lining the track where the wheels go, Rocky Mountain instead built a steel trap that encases the wood track and is much stronger.

HACKENSACK, N.J. — Though they have "rat" in their name, the Allegheny woodrats are nothing like the common rats that skitter across subway rails and leap out of urban dumpsters. Instead, these native New Jerseyans prefer the quiet life outside of cities and look more like jolly, oversized field mice.

But times are tough for woodrats. Once common from New England to Alabama, the woodrat has disappeared from Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York, has significantly declined in Pennsylvania, and is nearly gone from Ohio and Indiana.

They also collect dried raccoon droppings, which contain undigested seeds and berries that the woodrat can feed on. Those raccoon droppings often also include roundworm eggs. "The eggs can last practically forever — they are highly stable," Valent said. "The woodrats ingest the egg and the larvae gets into their bloodstream and the organs and if it hits the central nervous system, it can cause death."

To help stave off the demise of Bergen's woodrats, Valent has launched a two-pronged strategy. Twice a year, in spring and fall, Valent travels by boat along the Hudson and lands at the hard-to-access areas at the base of the Palisades where woodrats live. There, he sets out bait for raccoons, laced with dewormer. The bait includes fishmeal and marshmallow fluff. "They love anything sweet," Valent said.

But it's a challenging battle. "I see field mice that are infected with roundworm — you can tell because they just walk in a circle," Valent said. "Then if a raccoon eats the mouse, he's reinfected and it starts all over again."

Hassinger developed a particular protective affinity for the woodrat. He even took umbrage to that "rat" moniker, and wrote a poem to that effect.

"It ain't wood and it ain't rat," the poem reads. "These misnomers are a bummer — not funny; we call it the boulder bunny."

Using the genome of a modern African savanna elephant as a reference point, the group then analyzed the mammoth DNA. Mammal genomes have two copies of every DNA molecule, one contributed from an animal's mother and another from its father. By comparing the two DNA copies in each mammoth and noting when they were identical and when they weren't, Palkopoulou and her colleagues were able to estimate how closely related the mammoths' parents would have been—an indication of the genetic diversity in the Wrangel Island and older Siberian populations. They were also able to estimate the two populations' sizes.

That chance discovery made the researchers wonder just how common cervical ribs were."We knew these were just about the last mammoths living there, so we suspected something was happening," study leader Jelle Reumer, a paleontologist at Utrecht University and director of the Natural History Museum Rotterdam, said in a statement.

A new issue is growing out of labor's drive for a higher minimum wage for fast-food employees: wage theft, an umbrella term for failing to pay workers what they're legally owed.

In recent months, lawsuits alleging wage theft abuses have been filed on behalf of fast-food workers in three states, and state attorneys general have obtained a couple of hefty settlements from employers charged with violations.

The issue came to the forefront Thursday in front of three McDonald's and Burger King restaurants in Kansas City, Mo., where signs proclaiming "wage theft" and "stolen wages" dotted a midday rally by the StandUpKC coalition. It was attended by about 250 members of the fast-food workforce, labor unions, and the faith, justice and legal communities.

Wage theft protests occurred in numerous cities in mid-March. The protests come on the heels of national raise-the-minimum-wage campaigns by President Barack Obama, the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the U.S. Department of Labor. Some of the activism — calls for "$15 and a union" — focuses on the relative loss of low-wage buying power since the Great Recession.

Michael Saltsman, spokesman for the Employment Policies Institute, a group that generally supports employers' interests in the restaurant industry, said his organization doesn't take such polls very seriously.

Shortcomings in our education and workforce development systems continue to widen the skills gap. Left unchanged, the supply of skilled workers will dwindle — leaving some 5 million jobs vacant by 2018 — and won't keep pace with the demands of a modern economy or the needs of employers struggling to compete.

And many businesses haven't. The essence of enterprise is solving problems and fulfilling needs, so it should surprise no one that business leaders are innovating their way out of the problem.

Talent pipeline management isn't much different from the state-of-the-art supply chain principles that companies use to source goods, capital or information. It involves demand-driven relationships between end-use customers, in this case employers and their suppliers, education and workforce providers, to create and share value.

Rolls-Royce employed this strategy when it built its massive Crosspointe engine manufacturing complex in Virginia.

Before making the $170 million investment in the first-ever Rolls-Royce facility to be built from the ground up on U.S. soil, the company wanted to be sure that skilled workers would be available and in steady supply.

So it partnered with the local community college system to establish a program tailored to its advanced manufacturing operations. Since forging this innovative partnership, Rolls-Royce has provided input on the course work and curricula, as well as new tools and resources to train students on the same machines that are used at the Crosspointe facility.

These kinds of arrangements add value for everyone involved. The employer wins by having steady access to candidates who are not only qualified, but whose skills have been customized to the demands of the position. The education partner benefits by being able to point to concrete job opportunities for its graduates, thus raising its competitive edge and helping recruit students. And those students ultimately receive an education that comes with real job prospects.

The remedy is not to have schools create new and easier courses to accommodate students who aren't legitimate college prospects, but to create more vocational training opportunities along the lines that have been standard in Germany for decades. Forced to rebuild its industrial might from the rubble of World War II, the Germans long have placed a high value on vocational education.



The world isn't getting smaller, it's getting fatter, according to a comprehensive report published Thursday in The Lancet.

Whether you're looking at men or women, children or adults, citizens of rich countries or poor ones, people were much more likely to be overweight or obese in 2013 than they were in 1980, the study found.

In 1980 — the year Pac-Man was unleashed on the world and John Lennon was assassinated — there were 857 million people on the planet who were either overweight or [obese](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=obesity). Thirty-three years later, the comparable figure was 2.1 billion.

It's not just that the global population grew (and thus the number of people with too many pounds on their frames). The proportion of men who were overweight or obese rose from 28.8 percent in 1980 to 36.9 percent in 2013, while the proportion of women in that category increased from 29.8 percent to 38 percent during the same period, the report said.

All over the world, the passage of time was marked by bigger waistlines. "Successive cohorts seemed to be gaining weight at all ages, including childhood and adolescence," the researchers found. The most rapid period of weight gain came between the ages of 20 and 40.

A few extra pounds may seem harmless, but their cumulative effect is serious, public health experts say. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that being overweight or obese will increase a person's risk of such life-threatening conditions as coronary heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, stroke and certain types of cancer, among other problems. A 2010 study in The Lancet estimated that overweight and obesity caused 3.4 million deaths worldwide.

Perhaps this was the most depressing finding in the entire 16-page report: "No countries had significant decreases in obesity in the past 33 years."

The United States national soccer team took off for the World Cup in Brazil after months of hype and fanfare.

Suffice it to say, things were just a bit different 64 years ago when Walter Bahr and his U.S. teammates took off for Brazil. Bahr, a former Penn State soccer coach, is one of two surviving members of the 1950 U.S. soccer team. That year was the last time Brazil hosted the sport's global showcase.

After a funky opening ceremony featuring J-Lo in low-cut sparkling green and dancers dressed as trees, Brazil's beloved national team, the star-studded Selecao, made a solid if not brilliant start to the serious business of conquering a sixth world title. A good showing could assuage much — but not all — the public anger about World Cup spending of $11.5 billion in a nation with tens of millions of poor.

Of all the things young children put in their mouths, dirt may provoke the most concern among parents fearful that eating it will give kids worms.

Although there are reasons not to eat soil, worms may not be one of them.

The pioneering worm advocate, British scientist John Turton, had a hunch that intentionally inducing an immune response with human hookworm might quell his body's internal war on pollen.

Helminthic therapy is done with worms at the tiny, larval stage, not the kind of long worms that populate parental nightmares. As human antibodies do their work, depending on the species, the worms die off before they can grow, or before they can proliferate.

In other words: People who read stories are better at empathizing.

"When people are engaging with narrative fiction, they're imagining what it's like to be in these stories," Mar says.

Repeatedly trying to understand these characters exercises the same mental muscle that helps us understand people in the real world. And the better we are at "walking in their shoes," the more likely we are to treat others well, he says.

NEW YORK — In the summer of 1914, with the war in Europe just two weeks old, Henry James knew that something had been lost forever.

_In this valley of dying stars_

_In this hollow valley_

_This broken jaw of our lost kingdoms_

_In this last of meeting places_

_We grope together_

_And avoid speech_

_Gathered on this beach of the tumid river_

Soldiers returned maimed, traumatized, bewildered, a "lost generation," as Gertrude Stein called them. In Erich Maria Remarque's famous anti-war novel, "All Quiet On the Western Front," a German soldier rejects his patriotism, abandons his humanity and loses his life. Hemingway's short story "Soldier's Home" tells of a veteran named Krebs who finds that no one in his community wants to hear what really happened over there.

Lawrence Peter "Yogi" Berra, a native of St. Louis and Baseball Hall of Fame catcher who died Tuesday of natural causes at the age of 90, was known by many for such malaprops as "90 percent of the game is half-mental." Or, in referring to a once-popular restaurant, "Nobody goes there any more. It's too crowded."

But some of the Yogi-isms continue to ring true, like "It ain't over till it's over."

What should not be overshadowed, though, is that Berra had a World Series ring for every finger. He played in 14 World Series, including a record 10 world championship teams with the New York Yankees. He managed in two other World Series, one each with the Yankees and the New York Mets.

Berra, whose son, Dale, played in the majors and son, Tim, played with the Baltimore Colts in the National Football League, was married for 65 years to wife Carmen, a fellow St. Louisan who died in 2014. Berra and Carmen Short met in late 1940s at Biggie's restaurant, which later became Stan Musial and Biggie's.

But today, in one of Yosemite's most remarkable wildlife success stories, the bears are behaving better. Reports of bears damaging property or injuring people in the park have fallen 92 percent — from 1,584 in 1998 to 120 last year. And the number of bears that park officials have had to kill because they pose safety problems has fallen from about 10 a year in the 1990s to one or two a year now.

"The numbers are down, and that's awesome," said Ryan Leahy, a Yosemite wildlife biologist and bear expert. "More and more people are doing what they are supposed to do. But it only takes one slipup to cost a bear's life. Each person can have a huge impact."

San Jose, Calif. — Firefighters finally began to get a handle on the massive Rim Fire near Yosemite National Park, but not before the blaze destroyed one popular Bay Area family camp and damaged another.

For generations of Bay Area campgoers, news of the destruction brought the fire home.

"Our family is feeling pretty devastated because we have so many happy memories there, and it was a place we always look forward to returning," said David Kojan, one of many Berkeley natives who cherished visits with his wife and two young sons to the Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp just west of Yosemite.

As the cost of the fire topped $27 million, President Barack Obama pledged federal resources in a call to Gov. Jerry Brown, who on Monday visited with some of the firefighters battling the biggest of California's nearly dozen major wildfires burning from Eureka to Los Angeles, stretching resources amid peak wildfire season. Brown said "the firefighters have a real challenge on their hands" but promised to "get it done" with the money and manpower available.

Containment of the Rim Fire surged as the dirt lines dug by firefighters around the perimeter and constant air drops of water and retardant finally started to pay off.

"Slowly but surely, we are making progress," said Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant.

But it was too late to save the city-run Berkeley Tuolumne Family Camp just west of Yosemite, which first opened 91 years ago for $1 a day and 60 cents for children. Famed architect Bernard Maybeck was one of the locals dispatched to the area to finalize the site, news reports at the time said. The fire burned most of the 80 buildings, including 72 tent cabins, city spokesman Matthai Chakko said.

The elusive Sierra Nevada red fox was recently spotted in Yosemite National Park for the first time in nearly 100 years.

Like towns across southern Mexico and Central America, migration has changed the face of Oxkutzcab (pronounced OHSH-kootz-CAHB), which lies a three-hour drive south of Merida, Yucatan's state capital. The ethnic Mayan town has sent thousands of migrants to the San Francisco Bay Area, most of them to work in the food service industry.

Some of them have come back — or been deported by U.S. authorities — and brought a little of San Francisco with them. It's not just their cosmopolitan cooking talent. You see it in the scatterings of larger two-story homes paid for with U.S. restaurant wages. You also see it in the way men do housework, in a soupcon of tolerance for gay lifestyles and in a surge in street gang activity and drug use.

Some 70,000 Yucatecans reside in the Bay Area, Basto said, with smaller concentrations in and around Los Angeles and Portland, Ore. Many speak mainly Mayan, and only passable Spanish.

The migration has brought a patina of prosperity to towns such as this one and has affected matters ranging from crime and drug use to the way husbands treat wives.

"The place has changed, some for the better, some for the worse," said Gilmer Ruiz, a 35-year-old butcher who spent 10 years working in kitchens in the Bay Area. Ruiz walks with a cane, the result of multiple compound fractures to his right leg when he fell off the border fence trying to cross into Nogales, Ariz.

Nearly all Oxkutzcab migrants flocking to San Francisco start out as dishwashers, then rise in kitchens. Some have become sous chefs. They live in the shadows, vulnerable to immigration raids and deportation. Those who come back — either voluntarily or forcibly — have mismatched skills. While Oxkutzcab is a thriving agricultural center, few of its corn and citrus farmers can afford to eat Peking duck, Thai food or veal scallopini, or even have a taste for it.

Knecht thinks the old village was likely a winter gathering place on the Arolik River, south of modern Quinhagak. It was abandoned after the river shifted. The land is famously moving in this part of the world, constantly rearranged by rivers and ocean currents. The shoreline is rapidly eroding at the old village.

"Most of (the site) may have been washed away already," Knecht said. "We may just be looking at a portion of it. Maybe a quarter of the original site is left — and it's going fast." The ocean has already taken out the original dig site, he said. "If we hadn't done the work we did in 2009, 2010, everything, about 8,000 pieces, would have been lost. We're just barely staying ahead of it. It's kind of an emergency."

QUINHAGAK, Alaska — On the eroding Bering Sea coast of far Western Alaska, archaeologists from around the world are unearthing remnants of an ancient Yup'ik village frozen in place for hundreds of years.

Archaeologists involved say it's the biggest excavation of Yup'ik artifacts from before the arrival of Russians and other Europeans in the early 1800s. The research is taking place in this remote Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta village as well as labs in Europe, Canada and the United States.

Why? "Because we had nothing," said Warren Jones, president of the village corporation, Qanirtuuq Inc., which owns the dig site land. Cultural elements, including language and traditional dance, were stifled by the Moravian missionaries and nearly lost, said Jones, a behind-the-scenes leader in Quinhagak, home to about 700 people on Kuskokwim Bay some 70 miles southwest of Bethel.

Just in the past five years, 30 feet at the edge of the dig site has been lost.

KLAMATH, Calif. — Lauren Alvarado states it simply: "Meth is everywhere in Indian country."

Her recovery has come through a novel wellness program that puts traditional Yurok values to work to heal addicted men and women from California's largest tribe, whose ancestral land — and reservation — hugs the banks of the Klamath River.

Alvarado was one of those. She sought out wellness court coordinator Anthony Trombetti after a minor arrest left her facing a choice.

Lori Nesbitt is the wellness court advocate. She pores over county jail logs at the tribal enrollment office to identify those who need help. She snoops with aunts and uncles of court participants to get the lowdown on how they're really doing.

The journey made by about 2,000 zebras who traveled between Namibia and Botswana, two countries in a sparsely populated part of southern Africa, was discovered by wildlife experts only after some of the zebras were collared with tracking devices.

The newfound migration is a rare bright spot at a time when mass movements of wildlife are disappearing because of fencing, land occupation and other human pressures. Species of plants and animals around the planet are being wiped out at least 1,000 times faster than they did before humans arrived on the scene, said a separate study published Thursday by the journal Science.

The previously unheralded trek occurs within the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, which is the size of Sweden and encompasses national parks in Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Angola.

"It goes to show us that nature still has some surprises," said Robin Naidoo, senior conservation scientist at the Washington-based World Wildlife Fund that led the two-year study on the migration. He said the main reason that the migration was not detected earlier was because it was impossible to know where the animals were going without GPS tracking technology, which has become more available and affordable in the last two decades.

Wildebeest in the Serengeti migration in East Africa meander, possibly covering more ground and certainly migrating in greater numbers than the zebra in Namibia and Botswana. But the southern African zebra move largely in a straight line and the distance between departure and destination points appears to be an average of 10 to 20 kilometers (6 to 12 miles) farther than in the Serengeti, according to research cited by Naidoo.

Thousands of Brazil's newborns last year had abnormally tiny heads and potentially debilitating brain damage. In 2015 the country reported nearly 3,000 cases of the incurable condition, called microcephaly — about 20 times more than the prior year. In the nation's northeast, where most of the cases occurred, government officials have already declared a state of emergency. Now international researchers and Brazilian authorities are rushing to tamp down the problem.

ORLANDO, Fla. — U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, the nation's first black to hold that post, urged NAACP members convening in Orlando on Tuesday to help overturn stand-your-ground laws that "senselessly expand the concept of self-defense."

As he had been throughout the trial, Zimmerman was impassive. He seemed not to move a muscle until the jurors were taken out of the courtroom. Then the tension drained out of his face. A small smile began at the corners of his mouth and very slowly spread.

"Your bond will be released," Nelson told Zimmerman. "Your GPS monitor will be cut off, and you have no further business with this court."

Then the defendant's side of the courtroom exploded in hugs. Zimmerman hugged his wife, Shellie, and friends who have waited during the long trial that began with jury selection last month.

"I have two sons of my own," said Cathy Cole, one of the protesters. "I think the child was murdered." Zimmerman, 29, had been charged with second-degree murder in the shooting of Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in Sanford, in central Florida.

He maintained that he shot Martin in self-defense when the teenager attacked him. Prosecutors argued that he had profiled and stalked Martin, 17, who was returning from a convenience store after buying Skittles and a soft drink. Wearing the now-famous hoodie sweat shirt, Martin was walking in the rain back to the home where he was staying in the Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford.

After the verdict was read, the supporters and family of Martin left the courtroom silently, some shedding tears.

"We are very, very, very saddened, but we accept the jury's verdict in this case," Daryl Parks, one of the attorneys representing the Martin family, told reporters later. He said Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, and Tracy Martin, his father, "are just heartbroken."

In the protests before and after Zimmerman's indictment, hoodies played a prominent role. They, along with Skittles, were held up as symbols of racial profiling and of a senseless death.

After the shooting, local police had accepted Zimmerman's explanation that he acted in self-defense, but a special state prosecutor charged the neighborhood watch volunteer after weeks of protests and demonstrations by civil rights leaders across the nation. Much of the case's tension began in the six weeks between the shooting and the indictment of Zimmerman on the charge of second-degree murder.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Saturday night called on the U.S. Department of Justice to file civil rights charges against Zimmerman, said the group's president, Benjamin Jealous.

Led by the Martin family and civil rights leaders, supporters had called for Zimmerman, who identifies himself ethnically with his mother's Latino heritage, to be charged with the slaying. They argued that if a black man had shot an unarmed white teenager, authorities would have been less likely to accept the self-defense argument.

The furor reached all the way to the White House.

"Obviously, this is a tragedy," President Barack Obama said on March 23, 2012. "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."

CHICAGO — Injuries from zip line accidents have soared along with the popularity of an activity that hurtles riders through the air, sometimes at dizzying heights above ground, a study of U.S. emergency room data shows.

A zircon crystal embedded in sandstone found on a sheep ranch in Australia is the oldest piece of the Earth's crust to be discovered, shedding new light on our planet's formation.

"This paper drives a nail into that coffin (of doubt)," Mattinson said. "We're really getting back as far as we can go in the Earth's geologic records."

"Your mother and I have both taught students and we've seen what it takes to make this work. It will take working with the strongest leaders in education to help schools around the world adopt personalized learning. It will take engaging with communities, which is why we're starting in our San Francisco Bay Area community."

Still, critics scoffed Wednesday at what they viewed as self-interest wrapped in noble-sounding rhetoric that accompanied the announcement from Zuckerberg and his new Internet.org coalition. And it's not the first time his efforts have run into that criticism.

Helping new populations get online is clearly in Facebook's interest, said futurist and longtime Silicon Valley observer Paul Saffo. But he said it also represents a trend in which, unlike the days when business moguls waited until they retired to become philanthropists, "now we expect our [entrepreneurs](https://www.newsela.com/?tag=entrepreneur) to be charitable activists."
